1.1 Mean, Median, Mode
Video Lectures
Mean, Median, Mode
Deﬁnition 1.1.1 (Mean/Average) .
Mean = average of all terms =sum of all terms
number of terms
Deﬁnition 1.1.2 (Mode) .
Mode = Most common term(s)
Remark 1.1.3
There could be multiple modes. If the problem says “unique mode”, it means that there
is only one mode.
Deﬁnition 1.1.4 (Median) .After arranging the numbers in increasing or decreasing order:
If number of terms is odd,
Median = middle number
If number of terms is even,
Median = average of middle two numbers

1.2 Arithmetic Sequences
Video Lectures
Arithmetic Sequence
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 (Arithmetic Sequence) .An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers
with the same diﬀerence between consecutive terms.
1,4,7,10,13,..., 40
is an arithmetic sequence because there is always a diﬀerence of 3 between consecutive terms.
Remark 1.2.2
Note that an arithmetic sequence can also have a negative common diﬀerence. For
example, in the arithmetic sequence
40,37,34,..., 4,1
the common diﬀerence is −3.
Deﬁnition 1.2.3 (Arithmetic Sequence Notation) .In general, the terms of an arithmetic
sequence can be represented as:
a1,a2,a3,a4,...,an
where
•dis the common diﬀerence between consecutive terms
•nis the number of terms
7
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.2.4 (nth term in an Arithmetic Sequence)
an=a1+ (n−1)d
which basically means the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is equal to
ﬁrst term + (number of terms −1)(common diﬀerence)
We also have that
an=am+ (n−m)d
which means
the nth term = mth term + (number of terms −m)(common diﬀerence)
Theorem 1.2.5 (Number of Terms in an Arithmetic Sequence)
n=an−a1
d+ 1
Essentially,
Number of Terms =Last Term−First Term
Common Diﬀerence+ 1

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.2.6 (Average of Terms in an Arithmetic Sequence)
Average of Terms =a1+an
2
Average of Terms =a1+a2+···+an
n
which essentially means
Average of Terms =First Term + Last Term
2
Average of Terms =Sum of all Terms
Number of Terms
If the number of terms is even, x= average of middle 2 terms
.
If number of terms is odd, x= middle term
Theorem 1.2.7 (Sum of all Terms in an Arithmetic Sequence)
Sn=a1+an
2×n
which essentially means
Sum of All Terms = Average of Terms ×Number of Terms
We can also substitute
an=a1+ (n−1)d
to get
Sn=2a1+ (n−1)·d
2×n

1.3 Geometric Sequences
Video Lectures
Geometric Sequences
Deﬁnition 1.3.1 (Geometric Sequence) .A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers
with the same ratio between consecutive terms.
1,2,4,8,16,32...,1024
is a geometric sequence because there is always a ratio of 2 between consecutive terms.
Deﬁnition 1.3.2 (Geometric Sequence Notation) .In general, the terms of a geometric
sequence can be represented as:
g1,g2,g3,g4,...,gn
where
•ris the common ratio between consecutive terms
•nis the number of terms
Remark 1.3.3
Note that a geometric sequence can also have a negative common ratio. For example the
sequence 1,−2,4,−8,..., 512,−1024 has a common ratio of −2.
Theorem 1.3.4 (nth term in a Geometric Sequence)
gn=g1·rn−1
which basically means
the nth term of a geometric sequence = ﬁrst term ×(common ratio)number of terms−1
A general form for calculating the nth term
gn=gm·r(n−m)
which basically means
the nth term = mth term ×common ratio(n−m)

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.3.5 (Number of Terms in a Finite Geometric Sequence)
n= logr/parenleftBigggn
g1/parenrightBigg
+ 1
Essentially,
Number of Terms = 1 more than the number of times we needed to multiply rbyg1to getgn
Theorem 1.3.6 (Sum of all Terms in a Finite Geometric Sequence)
Sn=g1(1−rn)
1−r
which essentially means
Sum of All Terms = First Term ×1−common ration
1−common ratio
Theorem 1.3.7 (Sum of all Terms in an Inﬁnite Geometric Sequence)
For−1<r< 1,
S∞=g1
1−r
Remark 1.3.8
The reason the formula only works for |r|<1 is because if|r|≥1 the sum will diverge
or essentially be inﬁnite. We can only ﬁnd the sum of a converging geometric sequence
for which the sum approaches a constant value. Some Examples:
1 +1
2+1
4+1
8+···=1
1−1
2= 2
1 +1
3+1

Theorem 1.4.1 (Sum of Numbers Formula)
1 + 2 + 3 +···+n=(n)(n+ 1)
2
Theorem 1.4.2 (Sum of Odd Numbers Formula)
1 + 3 + 5 +···+ (2n−1) =n2
In simple terms, the
Sum of ﬁrst n odd numbers = n2
Theorem 1.4.3 (Sum of Even Numbers Formula)
2 + 4 + 6 +···+ 2n=n(n+ 1)
To intuitively think about it, just take 2 common from each term
2(1 + 2 + 3 +···+n) = 2(n)(n+ 1)
2=n(n+ 1)
In simple terms, the
Sum of ﬁrst n even numbers = 2 ×sum of ﬁrst n numbers

1.5 Telescoping
Video Lectures
Telescoping
Concept 1.5.1 (Telescoping)
Expand the ﬁrst few and last few terms, and cancel out any terms you see.
Remark 1.5.2
Generally, whenever you have long expressions that seem to be hard or impossible to
compute manually, telescoping is probably at play.
Concept 1.5.3 (Partial Fraction Decomposition)
Partial fraction decomposition is a telescoping technique in where you split terms into
multiple terms in order for terms to cancel. In general, to ﬁnd the partial decomposition
of1
abfor any arbitrary variables a and b, we write the equation
x
a+y
b=1
ab
and then solve for x and y. For example, the partial fraction decomposition of
1
n(n+ 1)
(in this case a=nandb=n+ 1 is
1
n−1
n+ 1
Using partial fraction decomposition, we can telescope and evaluate expressions easily.
1.6 Speed, Distance, and Time

Speed, Distance, and Time
13
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.6.1
Distance = Speed ×Time
Equivalently,
Speed =Distance
Time
Time =Distance
Speed
Theorem 1.6.2
Average Speed =Total Distance
Total Time
Remark 1.6.3
A common mistake is to assume that average speed is the averages of all speeds (especially
when the distance you are traveling at each of those speeds are the same). Remember,
that’s not true unless you are traveling at those speeds for the same amount of time!

System of Equations
Concept 1.8.1 (System of Equations Word Problems)
This is one of the most common topics on the AMC 10 especially. The trick to solving
these types of problems is to just assign variables to the unknowns in the problem and
solve them.
Concept 1.8.2 (Solving Systems of Equations)
Once you’ve found the system of equations in your word problem and/or the problem
itself gives you a system of equation, you should consider one or more of the following
methods for solving them.
1. Substitution
2. Elimination
3. Diagonal Product Method (Only for 2 variable Equations)
4. Adding/Subtracting Equations
5. Be on the lookout for common factorization tricks (see factorization section)
15
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
6.Constructing Polynomials from your equations using Vieta’s Formula (see Polyno-
mials Section)
7. Graphing your equation (I recommend you use graph paper)
8. Using Symmetry
9. Creating a geometric setup using geometric formulas such as the
•Law of Cosines
•Heron’s Formula
•Sin area formula
•Stewart’s theorem
•Trig Identities
(See the geometry section for information about these formulas)
1.9 Polynomials
Video Lectures
Polynomials
Concept 1.9.1 (Discriminant)
In the quadratic formula,
b2−4ac
(the part inside the square root) is the discriminant of the quadratic.
1. If the discriminant b2−4acis 0, then the quadratic has a double or repeated root
2. If the discriminant b2−4acis positive, the quadratic has 2 diﬀerent real roots
3. If the discriminant b2−4acis negative, the quadratic has no real roots
Remark 1.9.2
Also note that the quadratic can only have integer solutions if the discriminant b2−4ac
16
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
is a perfect square.
Theorem 1.9.3 (Quadratic Formula)
The solutions to the quadratic equation
ax2+bx+c= 0

Theorem 1.9.5 (Vieta’s Formula For Higher Degree Polynomials)
In a polynomial
anxn+an−1xn−1+...+a1x+a0= 0
, with roots
r1,r2,r3,...rn
the following hold:
r1+r2+r3+...+rn(the sum of all products of 1 term) = −an−1
an
r1r2+r1r3+..+rn−1rn(the sum of all products of 2 terms) =an−2
an
r1r2r3+r1r2r4+...+rn−2rn−1rn(the sum of all products of 3 terms) = −an−3
an
...
r1r2r3...rn(the sum of all products of n terms) = ( −1)na0
an
Note that the negative and positive signs alternate. When summing the products
for an odd number of terms, we will have a negative sign and otherwise we will have a
positive sign.
18
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.9.6 (Rational Root theorem)
In a polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+...a 1x1+a0
whereanis nonzero and each aiis integral, all rational roots of the polynomial ±p
qmust
have
•pdividesa0
•qdividesan
Essentially,
•the numerators of all fractional roots divide the constant term of the polynomial
•the denominators of all fractional roots divide the coeﬃcient of the largest degree
term.
Corollary 1.9.7 (Integer Root theorem)
In a polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+...a 1x1+a0
whereanis nonzero and each aiis integral
•All integer roots of the polynomial must divide a0or the constant term of the
polynomial
Remark 1.9.8
This means for polynomials with a leading coeﬃcient of 1 (monic polynomials), the only
rational roots will be integers.
Theorem 1.9.9 (Remainder Theorem)
The remainder when when a polynomial P(x) is divided by x−risP(r)
Corollary 1.9.10 (Factor Theorem)
x−rwill divide a polynomial P(x) ifP(r) = 0
This is a direct consequence of the remainder theorem.
19
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.9.11 (Representation of Polynomial in terms of roots)
In a polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+···+a1x1+a0
it can be expressed in the form
an(x−r1)(x−r2)(x−r3)...(x−rn)
wherer1,r2,r3,...,rnare thenroots of the polynomial.
Corollary 1.9.12 (Representation of Monic Polynomial in terms of roots)
In a polynomial
P(x) =xn+an−1xn−1+...a 1x1+a0
(with leading coeﬀecient 1), it can be expressed in the form
(x−r1)(x−r2)(x−r3)...(x−rn)
wherer1,r2,r3,...,rnare thenroots of the polynomial.
Theorem 1.9.13 (Fundamental theorem of Algebra)
A polynomial of degree n(the largest term is to the power of n) has n complex roots
including multiplicity (for example, a double root would be counted as 2 roots when
including multiplicity)
Theorem 1.9.14 (Conjugate Root Theorem)
Ifa+biis a root of a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, then a−biwill be too.
Theorem 1.9.15
Ifa+b√cis a root of a polynomial with rational coeﬃcients, then a−b√cwill be too.

1.9.1 Polynomial Manipulations
Concept 1.9.16 (Reciprocal Roots)
In a polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+...+a1x+a0
with rootsr1,r2,r3,...,rn,
Q(x) =a0xn+a1xn−1+...+an−1x+an
will have roots1
r1,1
r2,...,1
rn
Essentially, when ﬂipping the coeﬃcients of a polynomial, it will have roots that are
reciprocals of the original roots.
Concept 1.9.17 (Roots That Are More or Less)
In a polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+...+a1x+a0
with rootsr1,r2,r3,...,rn,
Q(x) =an(x−k)n+an−1(x−k)n−1+...+a1(x−k) +a0
will have roots
r1+k,r2+k,r3+k,...,rn+k
Remark 1.9.18
Remember, if the roots are k more, than we subtract k from each of the x terms in our
polynomial.
Remark 1.9.19
Polynomial Manipulations are useful when evaluating complex expressions in terms of
roots. For example, in order to evaluate
1
(r−3)3+1
(s−3)3+1
(t−3)3
of a polynomial with roots r,s,t , rather than expanding it out and bashing with Vieta’s
21
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Formulas, we can simplify construct a new polynomial with roots
1
(r−3)3,1
(s−3)3,1
(t−3)3
by the above methods and then simply ﬁnd the sum of the roots of the polynomial.
Theorem 1.9.20 (Newton Sums)
In a polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+...+a1x+a0
with roots
r1,r2,r3,...,rn
letS1=r1+r2+···+rn
S2=r2
1+r2
2+···+r2
n
...
Sk=rk
1+rk
2+···+rk
n
...
then the following holds true
anS1+an−1= 0
anS2+an−1S1+ 2an−2= 0
anS3+an−1S2+an−2S1+ 3an−3= 0
...
Note thatanegative number = 0 as that might show up in your expansion.
Essentially, what this is saying is
1.Start oﬀ with a Skvalue and multiply by it by the leftmost polynomial coeﬃcient.
2. Then, multiply Sn−1by the polynomial’s coeﬃcient right after it.
3. Continue doing so and summing the products until either
•k= 0 in which case instead of multiplying S0by last the last a term we
multiplyk
•an−ibecomes 0 in which case we simply add the last term and stop
4. Set your ﬁnal sum of terms to be equal to 0
22
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
Theorem 1.9.21
If
x+1
x=a
then
x2+1
x2=a2−2
x3+1
x3=a3−3a
x4+1
x4= (a2−2)2−2
Deﬁnition 1.9.22 (Symmetric Polynomials) .A polynomial
P(x) =anxn+an−1xn−1+...+a1x+a0
is symmetric if
an=a0
an−1=a1
an−2=a2
an−3=a3
etc.
Basically, opposite coeﬃcients are equal.

Here are some ideas for algebraic manipulation:
1. Group terms that are similar together
2. Be on the lookout for factorizations

Most ﬂoor and ceiling problems can be solved using these techniques.
1. Make the substitution x=⌊x⌋+{x}
2. Use the ﬂoor or ceiling function to ﬁnd an inequality

In a quadratic Q(x) =ax2+bx+c,
•Ifa>0, then the minimum value of Q(x) isc−b2
4aand occurs when x=−b
2a
•Ifa<0, then the maximum value of Q(x) isc−b2

Remark 1.12.3
Simple, yet powerful. This is the core of all inequalities and how more advanced
inequalities are derived.
The rest of the inequalities are optional for the AMC 10 but are still good to know.
Theorem 1.12.4 (AM-GM Inequality For 2 variables)
For non-negative reals a and b,
a+b
2≥√
ab
Basically, this means the average of 2 non-negative numbers (arithmetic mean) is always
at least as big as the square root of the product of the 2 numbers (the geometric mean).
Note that equality in this expression occurs when a=b.
Corollary 1.12.5
The minimum value of x+1
xis 2 and occurs when x= 1
Corollary 1.12.6 •The minimum value of a+b(ifabremains constant) occurs
whena=b
•The maximum value of ab(ifa+bremains constant) occurs when a=b

Theorem 1.12.7 (AM-GM Inequality For More Variables)
For non-negative reals a1,a2,...an,
a1+a2+···+an
n≥n√a1·a2·a3····an
Note that equality occurs when a1=a2···=an. (essentially all the variables are equal).
Another way to say this is
Average of n numbers =n/radicalBig
product of all n numbers
Remark 1.12.8
This means in general,
min(a1+a2+a3+···+an) =n·n√a1·a2·a3····an
max(a1·a2·a3····an) =/parenleftbigga1+a2+···+an
n/parenrightbiggn
Essentially,
min(sum of all numbers) = n·n/radicalBig
product of all numbers)
max(product of all numbers) = (average of all numbers)n
Remark 1.12.9
Generally, we use AM-GM to maximize products or minimize sums.
Theorem 1.12.10 (Weighted AM-GM Inequality)
For non-negative reals, ai,ci,
c1·a1+c2·a2+···+cn·an
c1+c2+···+cn≥c1+c2+···+cn/radicalBig
ac1
1·ac2
2·ac3
3·····acnn
Remark 1.12.11
Weighted AM-GM is very similar to AM-GM. One way to visualize weighted AM-GM
is that there are cknumber of terms which are all equal to ak. So instead of writing
30
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Algebra
ak+ak+···+akcktimes in our sum we simply write ak·ck, and instead of writing
ak·ak·... cktimes in our product we simply write ack
k.
Remark 1.12.12
We use weighted AM-GM when we are trying to make the sum of all terms a constant
by multiplying weights to all (or some) the terms. Remember to divide by the weights
you multiplied at the end.
Theorem 1.12.13 (Cauchy Schwarz)
For realsaiandbi,
(a1·b1+a2·b2+···+an·bn)2≤(a2
1+a2
2+...a2
n)(b2
1+b2
2+...b2
n)
This means
(the sum of the products of all akandbk)2≤
product of the sum of squares of all akandbk
Equality holds when the ratio ofai
bi
for all i is the same.
Remark 1.12.14
If you ever forget which side the ≥sign faces, just try a small example like a1= 1,
a2= 2,b1= 3, andb2= 4.
Remark 1.12.15
You generally want to apply Cauchy Schwarz when you are dealing with sums of squares.
Corollary 1.12.16 (Titu’s Lemma)
For realsaiandbi,

bn≥(√a1+√a2+···+√an)2
b1+b2+b3+···+bn

Note that this is a direct consequence of Cauchy Schwartz.

Steps to ﬁnd maximum/minimum of expressions
1.Try to ﬁnd another simple expression for maximization is greater than or equal to
the expression you are given OR minimization is less than the expression you are

2.1 Primes
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 (Primes) .Primes are numbers that have exactly two factors: 1 and the
number itself. Ex. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc. are all primes
Note: 1 is not a prime and 2 is the only even prime.
Remark 2.1.2
In order to check whether a number nis prime, we need to check all the primes that are
less than or equal to√n
Concept 2.1.3 (Prime Factorization)
Prime factorization is a way to express each number as a product of primes.
Examples:
The prime factorization of 21 is 3 ×7
The prime factorization of 60 is 22×3×5
33
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Number Theory
Theorem 2.1.4 (Number of Factors of a Number)
If the prime factorization of the number is expressed as:
pe1
1×pe2
2×···×pek
k
then the number of factors of this number is
(e1+ 1)(e2+ 1)...(ek+ 1)
Remark 2.1.5
Basically, in order to ﬁnd the number of factors of a number:
1. Find the prime factorization of the number
2. Add 1 to all of the exponents
3. Multiply them together
Concept 2.1.6 (Divisibility Rules)
2 Last digit is even
3 Sum of digits is divisible by 3
4 Last 2 digits divisible by 4
5 Last digit is 0 or 5
6 Divisible by 2 and 3
7 Take out factors of 7 until you reach a small number that is either
divisible or not divisible by 7
8 Last 3 digits are divisible by 8
9 Sum of digits is divisible by 9
10 Last digit is 0
11 Calculate the sum of odd digits (O) and even digits (E). If |O−E|
is divisible by 11, then the number is also divisible by 11
12 Divisible by 3 and 4
15 Divisible by 3 and 5

2.4 GCD/LCM
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 (Greatest Common Divisor) .The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of
two or more integers (which are not all zero) is the largest positive integer that divides each
of the integers.
Note: This is also known as GCF (Greatest Common Factor), and the terms GCF and GCD
are often used interchangeably.
Deﬁnition 2.4.2 (Least Common Multiple) .The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or
more integers (which are not all zero) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both
the numbers.
35
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Number Theory
Concept 2.4.3
GCD/LCM Greatest common divisor of m and n =GCD (m,n) can be found by taking
the lowest prime exponents from the prime factorizations of m and n.
Least common multiple of m and n =LCM (m,n) can be found by taking the high-
est prime exponents from the prime factorizations of m and n.
Theorem 2.4.4
The product of GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two
numbers:
GCD (m,n)·LCM (m,n) =m·n
Theorem 2.4.5
If two numbers have a common factor c, then

Theorem 2.4.6 (Euclidean Algorithm)
The Euclidean algorithm states that
gcd(x,y) =gcd(x−ky,y)
wherex>y andkis a positive integer.
Remark 2.4.7
We can apply the Euclidean Algorithm multiple times to easily ﬁnd the GCD of large
numbers since after applying the Euclidean algorithm, we know have 2 smaller numbers
which we can apply the Euclidean Algorithm again until we get 2 very small numbers.

For example,
gcd(186,92) = gcd((186−(2·92)),92)

Diophantine Equations
Deﬁnition 2.6.1. A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation such that the only
solutions of interest are the integer ones (an integer solution is such that all the variables
have integer values).
Concept 2.6.2 (Strategies to Solve Diophantine Equations)
Here are some ideas on how to solve diophantine equations
•Take mods of diﬀerent numbers. This is generally useful when you
1. Show there are no solutions to a Diophantine equation
2. Show that there are only a speciﬁc type of solution
•You can try to bound the possible values of diﬀerent terms. This is generally useful
when there are a ﬁnite number of solutions to your Diophantine equations
•Factoring, using the various factorizations (see the algebra section on this), can
help ﬁnd all the solutions
•Make substitutions to simplify your Diophantine equation
•Look for conditions on what must be multiples/divisors of your variables and
rewrite your Diophantine equation in terms of that

2.8 P-adic Evaluation
Deﬁnition 2.8.1. [Vp Notation] vp(n) is deﬁned as the exponent of p in the prime factoriza-
tion of n.
For example, v5(75) = 2 since 75 has 2 factors of 5. v2(27) = 0 since 27 is odd and has no
factors of 2.
Theorem 2.8.2 (Vp Exponentiation Formula)
vp(nk) =k·vp(n)
This basically means the power of pin a number nkisktimes that of the power of pin
n.
43
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Number Theory
Theorem 2.8.3 (Vp Product Formula)
vp(ab) =vp(a) +vp(b)
This basically means
exponent of pinab= exponent of pina+ exponent of pinb
Theorem 2.8.4 (Vp Division Formula)
vp(a
b) =vp(a)−vp(b)
This basically means
exponent of pina
b= exponent of pina−exponent of pinb
Theorem 2.8.5 (Vp Sum Formula)
Ifvp(a)/negationslash=vp(b), then
vp(a+b) =min(vp(a),vp(b))
Ifvp(a) =vp(b), then
vp(a+b)≥min(vp(a),vp(b))
Theorem 2.8.6 (Lifting the exponent (LTE) for odd primes)
If
a≡b/negationslash≡0 (modp)
then
vp(an−bn) =vp(a−b) +vp(n)
.
This basically means
exponent of pinan−bn= ( exponent of pina−b) + ( exponent of pinn)
ifaandbleave the same remainder when divided by pthat is not 0.
44
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Number Theory
Remark 2.8.7
Be very careful of the ﬁrst condition that is bold! Also remember 2 doesn’t work for p in
this equation! Sometimes when we can’t directly apply LTE to our exponent, we can
modify our exponents by rewriting our exponent terms.
Theorem 2.8.8 (Lifting the exponent (LTE) for 2)
v2(an−bn) =v2(a2−b2) +v2(n)−1
This basically means
exponent of 2 in an−bn= ( exponent of 2 in a2−b2) + ( exponent of pinn)−1

3.1.2 Combinations
Deﬁnition 3.1.3. A combination is a possible arrangement in a collection of items where
the order of the selection does not matter.

choosing the kobjects that will not be selected on the right hand side.
3.1.3 Permutations
Deﬁnition 3.1.7. A permutation is a possible arrangement of objects in a set where the

The number of subsets of a set of size nis 2n.
Remark 3.1.11
We have 2 choices for each element in the set: whether to include or not include the
element in our subset. This means that one of our subsets is the empty subset, where we
decide to not include all of the elements. If a problem trying to count subsets appears,
make sure to check whether we should count the empty subset.

3.2.1 Complementary Counting
Complementary counting is the problem solving technique of counting the opposite of what we
want and subtracting that from the total number of cases. The keyword “at least” indicates
that complementary counting may be helpful.
3.2.2 Overcounting
Overcounting is the process of counting more than what you need and then systematically
subtracting the parts which do not belong.
3.2.3 Casework
Many counting or probability problems can be solved by dividing a problem into several cases
and calculating arrangements and probabilities for each case before summing them together.
Remark 3.2.1
Casework can be a very useful strategy to solve combinatorics problem, especially when
there are no other obvious approach.

Deﬁnition 3.4.3. Expected value is the weighted average of outcomes.
Theorem 3.4.4 (Expected Value)
The expected value of some event Xis
/summationdisplay
xi·P(xi)
wherexiare the possible values of XandP(xi) is the probability they occur.
Basically the expected value is just sum the probabilities of events happening times
the number or amount of that event
Remark 3.4.5
Often times, in ﬁnding the expected value, we can just look for symmetry instead
of summing each individual probability times number. For example, to calculate the
55

expected value of a dice roll rather than evaluating
1
6·1 +1
6·2 +1
6·3 +1
6·4 +1
6·5 +1
6·6 = 3.5
we can see that since all rolls from 1 to 6 are equally likely, the expected value is just
the average roll which is just the average of the 2 middle terms which is 3 .5. (See the
arithmetic sequences section)

Expected Value
Theorem 3.4.6 (Linearity of Expectation)
For independent or dependent events,
E(x1+x2+···+xn) =Ex1+Ex2+···+Exn
Basically, what this means is that the total expected value of n events is just the sum
of the expected values of each individual event.
Remark 3.4.7
This theorem is powerful as it as it allows us to ﬁnd the expected value of the individual
events rather than of the whole thing at once.

Geometric Probability
Deﬁnition 3.4.8. Geometric probability is a way to calculate probability by measuring the
number of outcomes geometrically, in terms of length, area, or volume. The key to solving
geometric probability is
1.Try a few examples for the diﬀerent cases, make sure to always mark the extreme cases
2. Try to ﬁgure out the region the shape maps out

3.4.2 Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE)
Deﬁnition 3.4.10. The principle of inclusion and exclusion (PIE) is a counting technique
that computes the number of elements that satisfy at least one of several properties while
guaranteeing that elements satisfying more than one property are not counted twice.
Deﬁnition 3.4.11 (Union Symbol) .|A∪B|is the union of elements in both A and B
(duplicates are only written once)
Deﬁnition 3.4.12 (Intersection Symbol) .|A∩B|is the intersection of elements in both A
and B (only those elements which are in both sets)
Theorem 3.4.13 (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion for 2 Sets)
Given two sets,|A1|and|A2|
|A1∪A2|=|A1|+|A2|−|A1∩A2|
.
Basically, we count the number of possibilities in 2 ”things” and subtract the dupli-
cates.
Theorem 3.4.14 (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion for 3 Sets)
Given three sets, |A1|,|A2|,|A3|,
|A1∪A2∪A3|=|A1|+|A2|+|A3|−|A1∩A2|−|A1∩A3|−|A2∩A3|+|A1∩A2∩A3|
.
In this formula, we count the number of possibilities in 3 ”things”, subtract the
possibilities that are duplicates in all 3 pairs of sets, and add back the number of
duplicates in all 3 sets.

3.4.3 Bijections
Concept 3.4.16
A bijection is a one to one mapping between the elements of two sets. Bijections can
be useful because they allow you to convert diﬃcult problems to ones that can be more
easily calculated. When approaching a diﬃcult problem that may involve bijections, you
should start out by trying examples and looking for patterns.
Concept 3.4.17 (Recursion)
Recursion is the process solving the problem for small values and writing a recurrence
equation to iteratively calculate the values for larger values.
Steps to Solve Recursion Problems:
1. Base Cases: Manually ﬁnd the values for small values of n
2.Recursion Equation: Look at the diﬀerent cases for any general value of n(ex.
whether the last digit is 0 or 1)
•If you are stuck, you can try a few small cases and look for a pattern
3. Iteratively calculate higher values of nuntil you reach your answer
Remark 3.4.18
Note that you can get the answer to many recursion problems by using engineering
induction (see the meta-solving section).

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 3. Counting and Probability
Concept 3.4.19 (States)
We use states in problems when we are trying to ﬁnd the probability of ”a win” from
diﬀerent positions or turns
When encountering states problems we use the following steps
1. Assign variables to the probabilities of winning from the diﬀerent positions
2.Write your equations for the probability of winning from each of these positions in
terms of the other states
3. Solve your system of equations
Remark 3.4.20 (Symmetry in States)
Always be on the lookout for symmetry in states problems (positions where you have an
equal probability of winning from) to help simplify your equations.
Remark 3.4.21
Often times in state problems when you have a lot of states, you may have to write a
state recursion equation.

4.1.4 Similar Triangles
Concept 4.1.21 (Similarity Test)
Two triangles are similar if the three angles in the triangle are the same. In other words,
the triangles are the same shape multiplied by a scale factor.
In general, triangles are similar if:
•AA similarity: Two angles of the triangles are same, which basically means that
the third angle will be equal)
•SAS similarity (Side Angle Side): Two sides are proportional and the angle between
the sides is equal
•SSS similarity (Side Side Side): All three sides are proportional
•HL similarity (Hypotenuse Leg): In a right triangle, the hypotenuse and leg are
proportional
•LL similarity (LL Leg): In a right triangle, the two legs are proportional
Warning: SSA does not mean triangles are similar
An easy way to detect similar triangles is if bases of triangles are parallel and the
sides of the triangles are collinear (see ﬁgure below)

Note that in a polyhedron, if we know or can get information about the number of
faces/edges coming out of 1 point, and the number of vertices shared for every face/edge,
we can easily calculate the number of faces/edges from the number of vertices and vice
versa.

6.1 Basic Deﬁnitions
Deﬁnition 6.1.1 (Logarithm) .A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised
in order to get some other number.
Logarithms are expressed as
a=logbn
wherebis the base and nis the number.

get the number a, or what power do we need to raise the base to get the number a.

These formulas are extremely important for working with logarithms and should deﬁnitely
be memorized.

If you ever forget which way the sign of these logarithms are, you can just try a small
example like log10100 +log101000 =log10100,000 so from here for example you could
ﬁgure out the sum of logarithms identity.

The imaginary part does not include a factor of i.
7.2 Conjugates
Deﬁnition 7.2.1. A complex conjugate is found by ﬂipping the sign of the imaginary part
of complex number, and is represented as ¯ z.

7.3 Complex Roots
Deﬁnition 7.3.1. A polynomial of degree nhasnroots, and these roots may be complex.
For binomials, if our discriminant is negative we have complex roots.
7.4 Complex Plane
Deﬁnition 7.4.1. A complex number can also be represented geometrically by expressing
a+bias (a,b) on the Complex plane. The x-axis represents the Real axis and the y-axis
represents the Imaginary axis.
Deﬁnition 7.4.2. The magnitude of a complex number is represented by |z|, and is the
distance of a complex number ( a,b) from the origin.
Theorem 7.4.3 (Magnitude of a Complex Number)

Deﬁnition 7.5.5. Polar form is another way to represent a complex number based on its
modulusrand argument θ.
Theorem 7.5.6 (Polar Form)
z=a+bi=r(cosθ+isinθ) =rcisθ

Remark 7.5.8
Trigonometric ratios tell us that cosθ=a

thatrcosθ=aandrsinθ=b. Plugging in these values gives us the polar form formula.
Remark 7.5.9
cosθ+isinθcan also be written as cis θ.
Theorem 7.5.10 (Euler’s Formula)
Euler’s Formula tells us that
cosθ+isinθ=eiθ
, which tells us that
z=a+bi=r(cosθ+isinθ) =reiθ
.
Remark 7.5.11
Euler’s Identity is a special case of Euler’s Formula and tells us that

For a complex number z=reiθand a real number n,
zn= (reiθ)n=rn[cos(nθ) +isin(nθ)]
Remark 7.5.13
We can use this to evaluate expressions like
(3 + 2i)8
much easier because we just convert to polar form and apply De Moivre’s Theorem.
Remark 7.5.14
DeMoivre’s Theorem is very useful when dealing with complex numbers and exponents.
Theorem 7.5.15 (Rotating a Point)
To rotate a point θradians counterclockwise, covert a coordinate to its corresponding
complex number and multiply it by eiθ. Converting this back to ordered pairs gives us
our answer.
Concept 7.5.16
Complex numbers and their relations to circles makes them easy to work with for many
geometry problems, especially when dealing with polygons such as equilateral triangles
or squares.
How to solve geometry problems using complex numbers:
1. Assign a complex number to 1 or more of the coordinates
2. To ﬁnd the complex numbers for other points, multiple/divide by eiθ
3. Use the information you have to solve for what you are asked in the problem
Remark 7.5.17
We can also view algebraic complex number problems geometrically.

easily without clever manipulation of trigonometric identities that would be needed to
solve the problem otherwise.

Additional Techniques and Strategies
8.1 Meta-solving Techniques
Video Lectures
Meta-solving Techniques
Deﬁnition 8.1.1. Meta-solving is ﬁnding the answer to a problem without actually solving
it.
Remark 8.1.2
These techniques may not work for all problems. These techniques are especially useful
when the problem provides answer choices.
Remark 8.1.3 (Meta-Solving Warning)
Don’t get too carried away with these techniques to the point where you don’t even try
to solve the problem legitimately.
Concept 8.1.4 (Engineering Induction)
Engineering Induction is the process of trying and ﬁnding the value to small cases and
assuming it’s true for larger ones.
Steps for Engineering Induction Problems:
1. Try small cases
2. Look for a pattern amongst those small cases (there may not always be one)
133
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Additional Techniques and Strategies
3. Assume the pattern can continue for larger cases and ﬁnd the answer
Remark 8.1.5
We can try to apply engineering induction when we see the values in the problem seem
hard/impossible to compute.
134
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Additional Techniques and Strategies
Concept 8.1.6 (Looking for unique properties of numbers)
Rather than computing the exact answer, we can compute unique properties of your
answer choices so that you can eliminate all answer choices that don’t satisfy the property
and so that you will be left with 1 answer choice (or possibly more in which case you
can just guess from the remaining ones)
Some unique properties you can look for in your answer choices and try to compute are
•Units Digit
•Last 2 digits
•Parity (Even, Odd)
•Perfect square or not one
•Prime/composite
•Modulus (remainders when divided by 3, 4, 5, etc.)
•Denominators of common fractions (or what they must divide)
•Multiples/Factors of numbers
•etc.
Remark 8.1.7
These last 2 properties are especially useful in combinatorics problems as you can easily
ﬁnd numbers you have to multiply with each other to get your answer.
Concept 8.1.8
Look for the option choices that are the ”odd one out” or that are diﬀerent from all
others
•Look for outliers (primes, large/small numbers, odd/even numbers, powers of 2,
etc)
Concept 8.1.9 (Trying all the Option choices)
In some problems, you can
•Try all the option choices into the conditions in the problem
•Look at the conditions in the problem and see which of the option choices could
work
135
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Additional Techniques and Strategies
•etc.
After doing so, you will either have a better guess or exact answer.
Concept 8.1.10 (Elimination of Option Choices)
Tying closely to the previous technique, you can also usually eliminate option choices
based on
•Unique properties of Numbers (See Above)
•How large or small the number must be
Remark 8.1.11
We would recommend guessing ONLY if you can narrow it to 2 or 3 option choices.
Concept 8.1.12 (Estimation of Answer)
Often times in problems (especially geometry) you can easily ﬁnd an approximate answer
and see which of the option choices most closely matches what you got.
In geometry, a common strategy to do so is to mark out areas approximately equal to
those of areas you know.
Concept 8.1.13 (Using Freedom in Problems)
Assuming facts when you have freedom in the problem statement can be very useful.
Essentially, as long as the problem is not telling you ”this fact is not true” (so, whatever
assumption you want to make will satisfy the problem’s conditions) you can assume the
fact is true to simplify your problem and make it really easy to solve.
For example, if you are asked to ﬁnd some universal ratio in a triangle and you aren’t
speciﬁcally told that the triangle isn’t equilateral, you can just assume the triangle is
equilateral and solve the remaining problem from there.
Remark 8.1.14
Make sure not to assume false information! Be very careful that your assumption can be
true.
In our previous example, if we were told the triangle had 2 sides of length 7 and
8, then our assumption would be false, so it wouldn’t work then.

8.2 Silly Mistakes
Silly mistakes are very common and can really lower your score on the AMC 10/12. Here are
some tips on how to avoid the diﬀerent kinds of silly mistakes:
Concept 8.2.1 (Avoiding Arithmetic Errors)
A good way to avoid arithmetic errors is to
•Do your computation 2 ways (e.g. If you have to do 87 ·93, you can multiply them
with 87 on the top and with 93 on top)
•Be more organized, and write more steps
Concept 8.2.2 (Avoiding Mathematical Errors)
An easy way to avoid mathematical errors is to
•Do your work neatly!
•Make boxes for each problem on scratch paper per problem
•Don’t skip steps
•Check your work, following the tip above will make it easier to do so
•Do your steps methodically
•Try to substitute your answer back into the problem (if you can)
•Try an alternate solution to conﬁrm your answer
•Estimate what the answer has to be, and see if your answer is close to what your
estimate is
Concept 8.2.3 (Avoid Reading Errors)
Reading the problem wrong is one of the most common mistakes. Often times, you might
forget about important key words like
•inclusive, except
•even, odd
•prime, composite
•integer, natural, real, complex
137
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Additional Techniques and Strategies
Some strategies to avoid them are
•After solving the problem, reread the question part of the problem to make sure
you are answering what the question asks for!
•Underline key words while reading (that’s probably gonna be hard this year with
the test being online, but as an alternative you can take note of the important
words on your scratch paper)
Concept 8.2.4 (Avoid Missing a Final Step Errors)
Sometimes in problems, you might be so caught up in moving forward in the test that
you might forget an important step at the end.
For example, in a problem you might think ”I’ll multiply by 5 to whatever answer
I get” and then you ﬁnd that answer but forget to multiply by 5. A way to avoid this is:
•Write ”Remember ... ” big and bold on your scratch or the question paper
Remark 8.2.5
A very common reading mistake is getting confused between the words non-negative and
positive. Remember, non-negative includes 0 while positive doesn’t!
Concept 8.2.6 (Avoid Making False Assumptions)
Often times, you might just think something is true and assume it’s true for the rest
of the problem, when really it was false. Proving all your assumptions can be too time
consuming. However we recommend at least seeing some sort of reasoning for why your
assumption should be correct (unless of course you are using one of the meta-solving
techniques).
Concept 8.2.7 (Avoid Casework Errors)
Many times, in casework problems you might
•Undercount possibilities
•Overcount possibilities
•Miss edges/extreme cases
Some strategies to avoid them are
•Be methodical in your casework
138
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Additional Techniques and Strategies
•Make sure all your cases work
–An easy way to do this is just to try a few examples in your case to see if
they actually work
–Especially, make sure to check if extremes work
–Make sure all your cases are disjoint and that you are not overcounting
anything that’s common between the cases
–Make sure your cases cover all possibilities that the problem asks for
–Solve the problem in multiple ways (for example, by both casework and
complementary counting)
Remark 8.2.8
I know that some of these strategies may take a lot of extra time to follow so we
recommend analyzing how you are making silly mistakes and from there see which
strategies you will want to follow.

8.3 Other Strategies To Maximize Your Score
Concept 8.3.1 (Plan Your Time)
Make sure to plan your time.
•Questions 1-10 are generally easy, 11-20 are medium, 21-25 are hard
•Sometimes one of the early questions can be hard or bashy, or a later question can
be easy
•Don’t get stuck on a question. Move on and come back to it later.
•Star any question you are unsure about but you feel you can solve it, or any
questions that you solved but are not conﬁdent of your answer
•Budget your time properly
•Leave enough time for last 10 problems
•Leave some time to review starred problems and check your work
Concept 8.3.2 (Guessing Strategies)
If you want to guess, make sure to keep these things in mind:
•You get 1.5 points for leaving a question blank, so if you don’t know how to solve
the problem, just leave it blank
•Try using meta-solving strategies above
•If you can narrow down the choices to 2-3 options, only then make an educated
guess
Concept 8.3.3 (Test Day Strategies)
Here are some test day strategies:
•Don’t try to cram or study on the day before the test
–Just review a few formulas or strategies from this book
•Be relaxed
–Get a good night’s sleep
–Eat a healthy meal
140
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Additional Techniques and Strategies
–Meditate
–Eat dark chocolate
–Listen to music
–Or whatever else makes you feel relaxed
Concept 8.3.4 (Problem Solving Strategies)
Try to remember these problem solving strategies:
•When you are stuck, try to use the information in the problem you haven’t used
yet
•When solving a problem, think of what technique would likely be at play
•Don’t get too stuck with one approach to a problem, move on, and come back to
the problem with a fresh perspective
•In problems that seem complex, try small cases to look for a pattern that can allow
you to ﬁgure out how to approach the problem and what patterns may exist (this
is similar to engineering induction)
Concept 8.3.5 (AIME Qualiﬁcation)
To qualify for AIME, based on recent cutoﬀ scores, you will need a score of at least
105. However you should aim for 110+ to be safe. For this, you’ll need a 17-0-8 split
(right-wrong-skipped), a 18-5-2 split, a 19-6-0 split or something better.
Concept 8.3.6 (USAJMO/USAMO Qualiﬁcation)
To qualify for USAJMO/USAMO, you’ll probably need a score of at least 120 to have a
good chance (of course this also depends heavily on your AIME score).
Remark 8.3.7
Another strategy for the AMC 10/12B is that if you are expecting a AIME qualifying
score on the AMC 10/12A, then you should try to solve more problems and take a
”higher risk higher reward” approach for the AMC 10/12B, however if you didn’t do
good on the A, you should take a safe path.
Remark 8.3.8
Last, but most important, don’t stress out too much about how you will do! It’s just a
math contest, and you’ll probably have many more opportunities in the future.
Good luck to you on your math competitions. We hope you found this
