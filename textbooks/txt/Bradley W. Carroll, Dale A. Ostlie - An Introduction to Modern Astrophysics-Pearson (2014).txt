PrefaceSince the Ô¨Årst edition ofAn Introduction to Modern Astrophysicsand its abbreviated com-panion text,An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics, Ô¨Årst appeared in 1996, therehas been an incredible explosion in our knowledge of the heavens. It was just two monthsbefore the printing of the Ô¨Årst editions that Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announcedthe discovery of an extrasolar planet around 51 Pegasi, the Ô¨Årst planet found orbiting amain-sequence star. In the next eleven years, the number of known extrasolar planets hasgrown to over 193. Not only do these discoveries shed new light on how stars and planetarysystems form, but they also inform us about formation and planetary evolution in our ownSolar System.In addition, within the past decade important discoveries have been made of objects,within our Solar System but beyond Pluto, that are similar in size to that diminutive planet.In fact, one of the newly discovered Kuiper belt objects, currently referred to as 2003 UB313(until the International Astronomical Union makes an ofÔ¨Åcial determination), appears to belarger than Pluto, challenging our deÔ¨Ånition of what a planet is and how many planets ourSolar System is home to.Explorations by robotic spacecraft and landers throughout our Solar System have alsoyielded a tremendous amount of new information about our celestial neighborhood. Thearmada of orbiters, along with the remarkable rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have conÔ¨Årmedthat liquid water has existed on the surface of Mars in the past. We have also had roboticemissaries visit Jupiter and Saturn, touch down on the surfaces of Titan and asteroids, crashinto cometary nuclei, and even return cometary dust to Earth.Missions such as Swift have enabled us to close in on the solutions to the mysteriousgamma-ray bursts that were such an enigma at the timeAn Introduction to Modern Astro-physicsÔ¨Årst appeared. We now know that one class of gamma-ray bursts is associated withcore-collapse supernovae and that the other class is probably associated with the merger oftwo neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole, in a binary system.Remarkably precise observations of the center of our Milky Way Galaxy and othergalaxies, since the publication of the Ô¨Årst editions, have revealed that a great many, perhapsmost, spiral and large elliptical galaxies are home to one or more supermassive black holesat their centers. It also appears likely that galactic mergers help to grow these monsters intheir centers. Furthermore, it now seems almost certain that supermassive black holes are thecentral engines responsible for the exotic and remarkably energetic phenomena associatedwith radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, blazars, and quasars.The past decade has also witnessed the startling discovery that the expansion of the uni-verse is not slowing down but, rather, is actually accelerating! This remarkable observationsuggests that we currently live in a dark-energy-dominated universe, in which Einstein‚ÄôsFrom the Preface o  f An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicSecond Edition, Bradley W.

cosmological constant (once considered his ‚Äúgreatest blunder‚Äù) plays an important rolein our understanding of cosmology. Dark energy was not even imagined in cosmologicalmodels at the time the Ô¨Årst editions were published.Indeed, since the publication of the Ô¨Årst editions, cosmology has entered into a new era ofprecision measurements. With the release of the remarkable data obtained by the WilkinsonMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), previously large uncertainties in the age of theuniverse have been reduced to less than 2% (13.7¬±0.2 Gyr). At the same time, stellarevolution theory and observations have led to the determination that the ages of the oldestglobular clusters are in full agreement with the upper limit of the age of the universe.We opened the preface to the Ô¨Årst editions with the sentence ‚ÄúThere has never beena more exciting time to study modern astrophysics‚Äù; this has certainly been borne out inthe tremendous advances that have occurred over the past decade. It is also clear that thisincredible decade of discovery is only a prelude to further advances to come. Joining theHubble Space Telescope in its high-resolution study of the heavens have been the ChandraX-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Infrared Space Telescope. From the ground, 8-m andlarger telescopes have also joined the search for new information about our remarkableuniverse. Tremendously ambitious sky surveys have generated a previously unimaginedwealth of data that provide critically important statistical data sets; the Sloan Digital SkySurvey, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the 2dF redshift survey, the Hubble Deep Fieldsand Ultradeep Fields, and others have become indispensable tools for hosts of studies. Wealso anticipate the Ô¨Årst observations from new observatories and spacecraft, including thehigh-altitude (5000 m) Atacama Large Millimeter Array and high-precision astrometricmissions such as Gaia and SIM PlanetQuest. Of course, studies of our own Solar Systemalso continue; just the day before this preface was written, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiterentered orbit around the red planet.When the Ô¨Årst editions were written, even the World Wide Web was in its infancy. Todayit is hard to imagine a world in which virtually any information you might want is onlya search engine and a mouse click away. With enormous data sets available online, alongwith fully searchable journal and preprint archives, the ability to access critical informationvery rapidly has been truly revolutionary.Needless to say, a second edition of BOB (the ‚ÄúBig Orange Book,‚Äù asAn Introductionto Modern Astrophysicshas come to be known by many students) and its associated textis long overdue. In addition to an abbreviated version focusing on stellar astrophysics (AnIntroduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics), a second abbreviated version (An Introductionto Modern Galactic Astrophysics and Cosmology) is being published. We are conÔ¨Ådent thatBOB and its smaller siblings will serve the needs of a range of introductory astrophysicscourses and that they will instill some of the excitement felt by the authors and hosts ofastronomers and astrophysicists worldwide.We have switched from cgs to SI units in the second edition. Although we are personallymore comfortable quoting luminosities in ergs s‚àí1rather than watts, our students are not.We do not want students to feel exasperated by a new system of units during their Ô¨Årstencounter with the concepts of modern astrophysics. However, we have retained the naturalunits of parsecs and solar units (M‚äôand L‚äô) because they provide a comparative contextfor numerical values. An appendix of unit conversions (see back endpapers) is included forPreface

those who delve into the professional literature and discover the world of angstroms, ergs,and esu.Our goal in writing these texts was to open the entire Ô¨Åeld of modern astrophysics toyou by using only the basic tools of physics. Nothing is more satisfying than appreciatingthe drama of the universe through an understanding of its underlying physical principles.The advantages of a mathematical approach to understanding the heavenly spectacle wereobvious to Plato, as manifested in hisEpinomis:Are you unaware that the true astronomer must be a person of great wisdom?Hence there will be a need for several sciences. The Ô¨Årst and most importantis that which treats of pure numbers. To those who pursue their studies inthe proper way, all geometric constructions, all systems of numbers, all dulyconstituted melodic progressions, the single ordered scheme of all celestialrevolutions should disclose themselves. And, believe me, no one will everbehold that spectacle without the studies we have described, and so be able toboast that they have won it by an easy route.Now, 24 centuries later, the application of a little physics and mathematics still leads todeep insights.These texts were also born of the frustration we encountered while teaching our junior-level astrophysics course. Most of the available astronomy texts seemed more descriptivethan mathematical. Students who were learning about Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation, partitionfunctions, and multipole expansions in other courses felt handicapped because their astro-physics text did not take advantage of their physics background. It seemed a double shame tous because a course in astrophysics offers students the unique opportunity of actually usingthe physics they have learned to appreciate many of astronomy‚Äôs fascinating phenomena.Furthermore, as a discipline, astrophysics draws on virtually every aspect of physics. Thusastrophysics gives students the chance to review and extend their knowledge.Anyone who has had an introductory calculus-based physics course is ready to under-stand nearly all the major concepts of modern astrophysics. The amount of modern physicscovered in such a course varies widely, so we have included a chapter on the theory ofspecial relativity and one on quantum physics which will provide the necessary backgroundin these areas. Everything else in the text is self-contained and generously cross-referenced,so you will not lose sight of the chain of reasoning that leads to some of the most astoundingideas in all of science.1Although we have attempted to be fairly rigorous, we have tended to favor the sort ofback-of-the-envelope calculation that uses a simple model of the system being studied.The payoff-to-effort ratio is so high, yielding 80% of the understanding for 20% of theeffort, that these quick calculations should be a part of every astrophysicist‚Äôs toolkit. Infact, while writing this book we were constantly surprised by the number of phenomenathat could be described in this way. Above all, we have tried to be honest with you; weremained determined not to simplify the material beyond recognition. Stellar interiors,1Footnotes are used when we don‚Äôt want to interrupt the main Ô¨Çow of a paragraph.Preface

stellar atmospheres, general relativity, and cosmology‚Äîall are described with a depth thatis more satisfying than mere hand-waving description.Computational astrophysics is today as fundamental to the advance in our understandingof astronomy as observation and traditional theory, and so we have developed numerouscomputer problems, as well as several complete codes, that are integrated with the textmaterial. You can calculate your own planetary orbits, compute observed features of binarystar systems, make your own models of stars, and reproduce the gravitational interactionsbetween galaxies. These codes favor simplicity over sophistication for pedagogical rea-sons; you can easily expand on the conceptually transparent codes that we have provided.Astrophysicists have traditionally led the way in large-scale computation and visualization,and we have tried to provide a gentle introduction to this blend of science and art.Instructors can use these texts to create courses tailored to their particular needs byapproaching the content as an astrophysical smorgasbord. By judiciously selecting topics,we have used BOB to teach a semester-long course in stellar astrophysics. (Of course,much was omitted from the Ô¨Årst 18 chapters, but the text is designed to accommodate suchsurgery.) Interested students have then gone on to take an additional course in cosmology.On the other hand, using the entire text would nicely Ô¨Åll a year-long survey course (and thensome) covering all of modern astrophysics. To facilitate the selection of topics, as well asidentify important topics within sections, we have added subsection headings to the secondeditions. Instructors may choose to skim, or even omit, subsections in accordance with theirown as well as their students‚Äô interests‚Äîand thereby design a course to their liking.An extensive website athttp://www.aw-bc.com/astrophysicsis associated withthese texts. It contains downloadable versions of the computer codes in various languages,including Fortran, C++, and, in some cases, Java. There are also links to some of themany important websites in astronomy. In addition, links are provided to public domainimages found in the texts, as well as to line art that can be used for instructor presentations.Instructors may also obtain a detailed solutions manual directly from the publisher.Throughout the process of the extensive revisions for the second editions, our editors havemaintained a positive and supportive attitude that has sustained us throughout. Although wemust have sorely tried their patience, Adam R. S. Black, Lothl√≥rien Homet, Ashley TaylorAnderson, Deb Greco, Stacie Kent, Shannon Tozier, and Carol Sawyer (at Techsetters) havebeen truly wonderful to work with.We have certainly been fortunate in our professional associations throughout the years.We want to express our gratitude and appreciation to Art Cox, John Cox (1926‚Äì1984),Carl Hansen, Hugh Van Horn, and Lee Anne Willson, whose profound inÔ¨Çuence on us hasremained and, we hope, shines through the pages ahead.Our good fortune has been extended to include the many expert reviewers who casta merciless eye on our chapters and gave us invaluable advice on how to improve them.For their careful reading of the Ô¨Årst editions, we owe a great debt to Robert Antonucci,Martin Burkhead, Peter Foukal, David Friend, Carl Hansen, H. Lawrence Helfer, StevenD. Kawaler, William Keel, J. Ward Moody, Tobias Owen, Judith Pipher, Lawrence Pinsky,Joseph Silk, J. Allyn Smith, and Rosemary Wyse.

Several generationsof students have provided us with a different and extremely valuable perspective as well.Unfortunately, no matter how Ô¨Åne the sieve, some mistakes are sure to slip through, andsome arguments and derivations may be less than perfectly clear. The responsibility for theremaining errors is entirely ours, and we invite you to submit comments and corrections tous at our e-mail address:modastro@weber.edu.Unfortunately, the burden of writing has not been conÔ¨Åned to the authors but was un-avoidably shared by family and friends.

The Celestial Sphere1The Greek Tradition2The Copernican Revolution3Positions on the Celestial Sphere4Physics and Astronomy1THE GREEK TRADITIONHuman beings have long looked up at the sky and pondered its mysteries. Evidence of thelong struggle to understand its secrets may be seen in remnants of cultures around the world:the great Stonehenge monument in England, the structures and the writings of the Maya andAztecs, and the medicine wheels of the Native Americans. However, our modern scientiÔ¨Åcview of the universe traces its beginnings to the ancient Greek tradition of natural philosophy.Pythagoras (ca. 550b.c.) Ô¨Årst demonstrated the fundamental relationship between numbersand nature through his study of musical intervals and through his investigation of thegeometry of the right angle. The Greeks continued their study of the universe for hundredsof years using the natural language of mathematics employed by Pythagoras. The moderndiscipline of astronomy depends heavily on a mathematical formulation of its physicaltheories, following the process begun by the ancient Greeks.In an initial investigation of the night sky, perhaps its most obvious feature to a carefulobserver is the fact that it is constantly changing. Not only do the stars move steadily fromeast to west during the course of a night, but different stars are visible in the evening sky,depending upon the season. Of course the Moon also changes, both in its position in thesky and in its phase. More subtle and more complex are the movements of the planets, or‚Äúwandering stars.‚ÄùThe Geocentric UniversePlato (ca. 350b.c.) suggested that to understand the motions of the heavens, one must Ô¨Årstbegin with a set of workable assumptions, or hypotheses. It seemed obvious that the starsof the night sky revolved about a Ô¨Åxed Earth and that the heavens ought to obey the purestpossible form of motion. Plato therefore proposed that celestial bodies should move aboutEarth with a uniform (or constant) speed and follow a circular motion with Earth at thecenter of that motion. This concept of ageocentric universewas a natural consequence ofthe apparently unchanging relationship of the stars to one another in Ô¨Åxed constellations.

Attempting tounderstand this backward, orretrograde,motionbecame the principal problem in astron-omy for nearly 2000 years! Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Plato‚Äôs and an exceptionalmathematician, suggested that each of the wandering stars occupied its own sphere and thatall the spheres were connected through axes oriented at different angles and rotating at var-ious speeds. Although this theory of a complex system of spheres initially was marginallysuccessful at explaining retrograde motion, predictions began to deviate signiÔ¨Åcantly fromthe observations as more data were obtained.Hipparchus (ca. 150b.c.), perhaps the most notable of the Greek astronomers, proposeda system of circles to explain retrograde motion. By placing a planet on a small, rotatingepicyclethat in turn moved on a largerdeferent, he was able to reproduce the behavior ofthe wandering stars. Furthermore, this system was able to explain the increased brightnessof the planets during their retrograde phases as resulting from changes in their distancesfrom Earth. Hipparchus also created the Ô¨Årst catalog of the stars, developed a magnitudesystem for describing the brightness of stars that is still in use today, and contributed to thedevelopment of trigonometry.During the next two hundred years, the model of planetary motion put forth by Hip-parchus also proved increasingly unsatisfactory in explaining many of the details of the ob-servations. Claudius Ptolemy (ca.a.d.100) introduced reÔ¨Ånements to the epicycle/deferentThe Celestial Sphere

Predictions of thePtolemaic model did agree more closely with observations than any previously devisedscheme, but the original philosophical tenets of Plato (uniform and circular motion) weresigniÔ¨Åcantly compromised.Despite its shortcomings, the Ptolemaic model became almost universally accepted asthe correct explanation of the motion of the wandering stars. When a disagreement betweenthe model and observations would develop, the model was modiÔ¨Åed slightly by the additionof another circle. This process of ‚ÄúÔ¨Åxing‚Äù the existing theory led to an increasingly complextheoretical description of observable phenomena.The Celestial Sphere

(Courtesy of Yerkes Observatory.)2THE COPERNICAN REVOLUTIONBy the sixteenth century the inherent simplicity of the Ptolemaic model was gone. Polish-born astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473‚Äì1543), hoping to return the science to a lesscumbersome, more elegant view of the universe, suggested aheliocentric(Sun-centered)model of planetary motion (Fig. 4).1His bold proposal led immediately to a much lesscomplicated description of the relationships between the planets and the stars. Fearingsevere criticism from the Catholic Church, whose doctrine then declared that Earth wasthe center of the universe, Copernicus postponed publication of his ideas until late in life.De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium(On the Revolution of the Celestial Sphere) Ô¨Årstappeared in the year of his death. Faced with a radical new view of the universe, alongwith Earth‚Äôs location in it, even some supporters of Copernicus argued that the heliocentricmodel merely represented a mathematical improvement in calculating planetary positionsbut did not actually reÔ¨Çect the true geometry of the universe. In fact, a preface to that effectwas added by Osiander, the priest who acted as the book‚Äôs publisher.Bringing Order to the PlanetsOne immediate consequence of the Copernican model was the ability to establish the orderof all of the planets from the Sun, along with their relative distances and orbital periods.The fact that Mercury and Venus are never seen more than 28‚ó¶and 47‚ó¶, respectively, eastor west of the Sun clearly establishes that their orbits are located inside the orbit of Earth.These planets are referred to asinferior planets, and their maximum angular separationseast or west of the Sun are known asgreatest eastern elongationandgreatest western1Actually, Aristarchus proposed a heliocentric model of the universe in 280b.c.At that time, however, there wasno compelling evidence to suggest that Earth itself was in motion.The Celestial Sphere

Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn (the most distant planetsknown to Copernicus) can be seen as much as 180‚ó¶from the Sun, an alignment knownasopposition. This could only occur if thesesuperior planetshave orbits outside Earth‚Äôsorbit. The Copernican model also predicts that only inferior planets can pass in front of thesolar disk (inferior conjunction), as observed.Retrograde Motion RevisitedThe great long-standing problem of astronomy‚Äîretrograde motion‚Äîwas also easily ex-plained through the Copernican model. Consider the case of a superior planet such as Mars.Assuming, as Copernicus did, that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the more slowlyit moves in its orbit, Mars will then be overtaken by the faster-moving Earth. As a result,the apparent position of Mars will shift against the relatively Ô¨Åxed background stars, withthe planet seemingly moving backward near opposition, where it is closest to Earth and atits brightest (see Fig. 6). Since the orbits of all of the planets are not in the same plane,retrograde loops will occur. The same analysis works equally well for all other planets,superior and inferior.The relative orbital motions of Earth and the other planets mean that the time intervalbetween successive oppositions or conjunctions can differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from the amount oftime necessary to make one complete orbit relative to the background stars (Fig. 7). Theformer time interval (between oppositions) is known as thesynodic period(S), and thelatter time interval (measured relative to the background stars) is referred to as thesiderealperiod(P). It is left as an exercise to show that the relationship between the two periods isgiven by1/S=/braceleftBigg1/P‚àí1/P‚äï(inferior)1/P‚äï‚àí1/P(superior),(1)The Celestial Sphere

This lack of improvement was due to Copernicus‚Äôs inability to relinquish the 2000-year-old concept that planetary motion required circles, the human notion of perfection. Asa consequence, Copernicus was forced (as were the Greeks) to introduce the concept ofepicycles to‚ÄúÔ¨Åx‚Äùhis model.The Celestial Sphere

Perhaps the quintessential example of a scientiÔ¨Åc revolution was the revolution begunby Copernicus. What we think of today as the obvious solution to the problem of planetarymotion‚Äîa heliocentric universe‚Äîwas perceived as a very strange and even rebelliousnotion during a time of major upheaval, when Columbus had recently sailed to the‚Äúnewworld‚Äùand Martin Luther had proposed radical revisions in Christianity. Thomas Kuhnhas suggested that an established scientiÔ¨Åc theory is much more than just a framework forguiding the study of natural phenomena. The presentparadigm(or prevailing scientiÔ¨Åctheory) is actually a way ofseeingthe universe around us. We ask questions, pose newresearch problems, and interpret the results of experiments and observations in the contextof the paradigm. Viewing the universe in any other way requires a complete shift from thecurrent paradigm. To suggest that Earth actually orbits the Sun instead of believing that theSun inexorably rises and sets about aÔ¨Åxed Earth is to argue for a change in the very structureof the universe, a structure that was believed to be correct and beyond question for nearly2000 years. Not until the complexity of the old Ptolemaic scheme became too unwieldycould the intellectual environment reach a point where the concept of a heliocentric universewas even possible.3POSITIONS ON THE CELESTIAL SPHEREThe Copernican revolution has shown us that the notion of a geocentric universe is incorrect.Nevertheless, with the exception of a small number of planetary probes, our observationsof the heavens are still based on a reference frame centered on Earth. The daily (ordiurnal)rotation of Earth, coupled with its annual motion around the Sun and the slow wobble of itsrotation axis, together with relative motions of the stars, planets, and other objects, resultsin the constantly changing positions of celestial objects. To catalog the locations of objectssuch as the Crab supernova remnant in Taurus or the great spiral galaxy of Andromeda,coordinates must be speciÔ¨Åed. Moreover, the coordinate system should not be sensitive tothe short-term manifestations of Earth‚Äôs motions; otherwise the speciÔ¨Åed coordinates wouldconstantly change.The Altitude‚ÄìAzimuth Coordinate SystemViewing objects in the night sky requires only directions to them, not their distances. Wecan imagine that all objects are located on a celestial sphere, just as the ancient Greeksbelieved. It then becomes sufÔ¨Åcient to specify only two coordinates. The most straight-forward coordinate system one might devise is based on the observer‚Äôs local horizon. Thealtitude‚Äìazimuth(orhorizon)coordinate systemis based on the measurement of the az-imuth angle along the horizon together with the altitude angle above the horizon (Fig. 8).Thealtitudehis deÔ¨Åned as that angle measured from the horizon to the object along a greatcircle2that passes through that object and the point on the celestial sphere directly abovethe observer, a point known as thezenith. Equivalently, thezenith distancezis the anglemeasured from the zenith to the object, soz+h=90‚ó¶. TheazimuthAis simply the angle2A great circle is the curve resulting from the intersection of a sphere with a plane passing through thecenterofthat sphere.The Celestial Sphere

(Themeridianis another frequently used great circle; it is deÔ¨Åned as passingthrough the observer‚Äôs zenith and intersecting the horizon due north and south.)Although simple to deÔ¨Åne, the altitude‚Äìazimuth system is difÔ¨Åcult to use in practice.Coordinates of celestial objects in this system are speciÔ¨Åc to the local latitude and longitudeof the observer and are difÔ¨Åcult to transform to other locations on Earth. Also, since Earthis rotating, stars appear to move constantly across the sky, meaning that the coordinates ofeach object are constantly changing, even for the local observer. Complicating the problemstill further, the stars rise approximately 4 minutes earlier on each successive night, so thateven when viewed from the same location at a speciÔ¨Åed time, the coordinates change fromday to day.Daily and Seasonal Changes in the SkyTo understand the problem of these day-to-day changes in altitude‚Äìazimuth coordinates, wemust consider the orbital motion of Earth about the Sun (see Fig. 9). As Earth orbits theSun, our view of the distant stars is constantly changing. Our line of sight to the Sun sweepsthrough the constellations during the seasons; consequently, we see the Sun apparentlymove through those constellations along a path referred to as theecliptic.3During thespring the Sun appears to travel across the constellation of Virgo, in the summer it movesthrough Orion, during the autumn months it enters Aquarius, and in the winter the Sun islocated near Scorpius. As a consequence, those constellations become obscured in the glareof daylight, and other constellations appear in our night sky. This seasonal change in theconstellations is directly related to the fact that a given star rises approximately 4 minutesearlier each day. Since Earth completes one sidereal period in approximately 365.26 days,it moves slightly less than 1‚ó¶around its orbit in 24 hours. Thus Earth must actually rotatenearly 361‚ó¶to bring the Sun to the meridian on two successive days (Fig. 10). Because ofthe much greater distances to the stars, they do not shift their positions signiÔ¨Åcantly as Earthorbits the Sun. As a result, placing a star on the meridian on successive nights requires onlya 360‚ó¶rotation. It takes approximately 4 minutes for Earth to rotate the extra 1‚ó¶. Therefore agiven star rises 4 minutes earlier each night.Solar timeis deÔ¨Åned as anaverageinterval of3The termeclipticis derived from the observation of eclipses along that path through the heavens.The Celestial Sphere

As a result of the tilt, the ecliptic moves northand south of thecelestial equator(Fig. 11), which is deÔ¨Åned by passing a plane throughEarth at its equator and extending that plane out to the celestial sphere. The sinusoidalshape of the ecliptic occurs because the Northern Hemisphere alternately points towardand then away from the Sun during Earth‚Äôs annual orbit. Twice during the year the Suncrosses the celestial equator, once moving northward along the ecliptic and later movingto the south. In theÔ¨Årst case, the point of intersection is called thevernal equinoxandthe southern crossing occurs at theautumnal equinox. Spring ofÔ¨Åcially begins when thecenter of the Sun is precisely on the vernal equinox; similarly, fall begins when the centerof the Sun crosses the autumnal equinox. The most northern excursion of the Sun along theecliptic occurs at thesummer solstice, representing the ofÔ¨Åcial start of summer, and thesouthernmost position of the Sun is deÔ¨Åned as thewinter solstice.The seasonal variations in weather are due to the position of the Sun relative to thecelestial equator. During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun‚Äôs northerndeclination causes it to appear higher in the sky, producing longer days and more intensesunlight. During the winter months the declination of the Sun is below the celestial equator,its path above the horizon is shorter, and its rays are less intense (see Fig. 12). The moredirect the Sun‚Äôs rays, the more energy per unit area strikes Earth‚Äôs surface and the higherthe resulting surface temperature.The Celestial Sphere

Right ascension is traditionally measured in hours, min-utes, and seconds; 24 hours of right ascension is equivalent to 360‚ó¶, or 1 hour=15‚ó¶. Therationale for this unit of measure is based on the 24 hours (sidereal time) necessary for anobject to make two successive crossings of the observer‚Äôs local meridian. The coordinatesof right ascension and declination are also indicated in Figs. 2 and 11. Since the equa-torial coordinate system is based on the celestial equator and the vernal equinox, changesin the latitude and longitude of the observer do not affect the values of right ascension anddeclination. Values ofŒ±andŒ¥are similarly unaffected by the annual motion of Earth aroundthe Sun.Thelocal sidereal timeof the observer is deÔ¨Åned as the amount of time that has elapsedsince the vernal equinox last traversed the meridian. Local sidereal time is also equivalent tothehour angleHof the vernal equinox, where hour angle is deÔ¨Åned as the angle betweena celestial object and the observer‚Äôs meridian, measured in the direction of the object‚Äôsmotion around the celestial sphere.PrecessionDespite referencing the equatorial coordinate system to the celestial equator and its inter-section with the ecliptic (the vernal equinox),precessioncauses the right ascension anddeclination of celestial objects to change, albeit very slowly. Precession is the slow wobbleof Earth‚Äôs rotation axis due to our planet‚Äôs nonspherical shape and its gravitational inter-action with the Sun and the Moon. It was Hipparchus whoÔ¨Årst observed the effects ofprecession. Although we will not discuss the physical cause of this phenomenon in detail,it is completely analogous to the well-known precession of a child‚Äôs toy top. Earth‚Äôs pre-cession period is 25,770 years and causes the north celestial pole to make a slow circlethrough the heavens. Although Polaris (the North Star) is currently within 1‚ó¶of the northThe Celestial Sphere

celestial pole, in 13,000 years it will be nearly 47‚ó¶away from that point. The same effectalso causes a 50.26‚Ä≤‚Ä≤yr‚àí1westward motion of the vernal equinox along the ecliptic.4Anadditional precession effect due to Earth‚Äìplanet interactions results in an eastward motionof the vernal equinox of 0.12‚Ä≤‚Ä≤yr‚àí1.Because precession alters the position of the vernal equinox along the ecliptic, it isnecessary to refer to a speciÔ¨Åcepoch(or reference date) when listing the right ascensionand declination of a celestial object. The current values ofŒ±andŒ¥may then be calculated,based on the amount of time elapsed since the reference epoch. The epoch commonly usedtoday for astronomical catalogs of stars, galaxies, and other celestial phenomena refers toan object‚Äôs position at noon in Greenwich, England (universal time,UT) on January 1,2000.5A catalog using this reference date is designated as J2000.0.

TheGregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, carefully speciÔ¨Åes whichyears are to be considered leap years. Although leap years are useful for many purposes,astronomers are generally interested in the number of days (or seconds) between events,not in worrying about the complexities of leap years. Consequently, astronomers typicallyrefer to the times when observations were made in terms of the elapsed time since somespeciÔ¨Åed zero time. The time that is universally used is noon on January 1, 4713b.c.,a sspeciÔ¨Åed by the Julian calendar. This time is designated as JD 0.0, where JD indicatesJulian Date.6The Julian date of J2000.0 is JD 2451545.0. Times other than noon universaltime are speciÔ¨Åed as fractions of a day; for example, 6pmJanuary 1, 2000 UT would bedesignated JD 2451545.25. Referring to Julian date, the parameterTdeÔ¨Åned by Eq. ( 4)can also be written asT=(JD‚àí2451545.0)/36525,where the constant 36,525 is taken from theJulian year, which is deÔ¨Åned to be exactly365.25 days.Another commonly-used designation is theModiÔ¨Åed Julian Date(MJD), deÔ¨Åned asMJD‚â°JD‚àí2400000.5, where JD refers to the Julian date. Thus a MJD day begins atmidnight, universal time, rather than at noon.6The Julian date JD 0.0 was proposed by Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540‚Äì1609) in 1583. His choice was based onthe convergence of three calendar cycles; the 28 years required for the Julian calendar dates to fall on the samedays of the week, the 19 years required for the phases of the Moon tonearlyfall on the same dates of the year, andthe 15-year Roman tax cycle. 28√ó19√ó15=7980 means that the three calendars align once every 7980 years.JD 0.0 corresponds to the last time the three calendars all started their cycles together.The Celestial Sphere

Because of the need to measure events very precisely in astronomy, various high-precision time measurements are used. For instance,Heliocentric Julian Date(HJD) isthe Julian Date of an event as measured from the center of the Sun. In order to determinethe heliocentric Julian date, astronomers must consider the time it would take light to travelfrom a celestial object to the center of the Sun rather than to Earth.Terrestrial Time(TT)is time measured on the surface of Earth, taking into consideration the effects of special andgeneralrelativityasEarthmovesaroundtheSunandrotatesonitsownaxisArchaeoastronomyAn interesting application of the ideas discussed above is in the interdisciplinaryÔ¨Åeld ofarchaeoastronomy, a merger of archaeology and astronomy. Archaeoastronomy is aÔ¨Åeldof study that relies heavily on historical adjustments that must be made to the positions ofobjects in the sky resulting from precession. It is the goal of archaeoastronomy to studythe astronomy of past cultures, the investigation of which relies heavily on the alignmentsof ancient structures with celestial objects. Because of the long periods of time since con-struction, care must be given to the proper precession of celestial coordinates if any proposedalignments are to be meaningful. The Great Pyramid at Giza (Fig. 14), one of the‚Äúsevenwonders of the world,‚Äùis an example of such a structure. Believed to have been erectedabout 2600b.c., the Great Pyramid has long been the subject of speculation. Although manyof the proposals concerning this amazing monument are more than somewhat fanciful, therecan be no doubt about its careful orientation with the four cardinal positions, north, south,east, and west.

Equally astounding is the nearly perfect square formed by its base; no twosides differ in length by more than 20 cm.Perhaps the most demanding alignments discovered so far are associated with the‚Äúairshafts‚Äùleading from the King‚Äôs Chamber (the main chamber of the pyramid) to the outside.These air shafts seem too poorly designed to circulate fresh air into the tomb of Pharaoh, andTo ThubanTo Orion‚Äôs belt

it is now thought that they served another function. The Egyptians believed that when theirpharaohs died, their souls would travel to the sky to join Osiris, the god of life, death, andrebirth. Osiris was associated with the constellation we now know as Orion. Allowing forover one-sixth of a precession period since the construction of the Great Pyramid, VirginiaTrimble has shown that one of the air shafts pointed directly to Orion‚Äôs belt. The other airshaft pointed toward Thuban, the star that wasthenclosest to the north celestial pole, thepoint in the sky about which all else turns.As a modern scientiÔ¨Åc culture, we trace our study of astronomy to the ancient Greeks, butit has become apparent that many cultures carefully studied the sky and its mysterious pointsof light. Archaeological structures worldwide apparently exhibit astronomical alignments.Although some of these alignments may be coincidental, it is clear that many of them wereby design.The Effects of Motions Through the HeavensAnother effect contributing to the change in equatorial coordinates is due to the intrinsicvelocities of the objects themselves.7As we have already discussed, the Sun, the Moon,and the planets exhibit relatively rapid and complex motions through the heavens. The starsalso move with respect to one another. Even though their actual speeds may be very large,the apparent relative motions of stars are generally very difÔ¨Åcult to measure because of theirenormous distances.Consider the velocity of a star relative to an observer (Fig. 15).

The inability of astronomers to accuratelyÔ¨Åt the observedpositions of the‚Äúwandering stars‚Äùwith mathematical models resulted in a dramatic changein our perception of Earth‚Äôs location in the universe. However, an equally important stepstill remained in the development of science: the search forphysical causesof observableAs a part of our investigation of the science of astronomy, it will be necessary to studythe details of celestial motions, the nature of light, the structure of the atom, and the shapeof space itself. Rapid advances in astronomy over the past several decades have occurredbecause of advances in our understanding of fundamental physics and because of improve-ments in the tools we use to study the heavens: telescopes and computers.Essentially every area of physics plays an important role in some aspect of astronomy.Particle physics and astrophysics merge in the study of the Big Bang; the basic questionof the origin of the zoo of elementary particles, as well as the very nature of the fundamentalforces, is intimately linked to how the universe was formed. Nuclear physics providesinformation about the types of reactions that are possible in the interiors of stars, and atomicphysics describes how individual atoms interact with one another and with light, processesthat are basic to a great many astrophysical phenomena. Condensed-matter physics plays aThe Celestial Sphere

The application of physics to astronomy, astrophysics, has proved very successful in explaining a wide range of observations, in-cluding strange and exotic objects and events, such as pulsating stars, supernovae, variable X-ray sources, black holes, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, and the Big Bang.,

role in the crusts of neutron stars and in the center of Jupiter. Thermodynamics is involvedeverywhere from the Big Bang to the interiors of stars. Even electronics plays an importantrole in the development of new detectors capable of giving a clearer view of the universearound us.With the advent of modern technology and the space age, telescopes have been built tostudy the heavens with ever-increasing sensitivity. No longer limited to detecting visiblelight, telescopes are now capable of‚Äúseeing‚Äùgamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light, infraredradiation, and radio signals. Many of these telescopes require operation above Earth‚Äôsatmosphere to carry out their missions. Other types of telescopes, very different in nature,detect elementary particles instead of light and are often placed below ground to study theheavens.Computers have provided us with the power to carry out the enormous number of calcu-lations necessary to build mathematical models from fundamental physical principles. Thebirth of high-speed computing machines has enabled astronomers to calculate the evolutionof a star and compare those calculations with observations; it is also possible to study therotation of a galaxy and its interaction with neighboring galaxies. Processes that requirebillions of years (signiÔ¨Åcantly longer than any National Science Foundation grant) cannotpossibly be observed directly but may be investigated using the modern supercomputer.All of these tools and related disciplines are used to look at the heavens with a probingeye. The study of astronomy is a natural extension of human curiosity in its purest form. Justas a small child is always asking why this or that is the way it is, the goal of an astronomeris to attempt to understand the nature of the universe in all of its complexity, simply for thesake of understanding‚Äîthe ultimate end of any intellectual adventure. In a very real sense,the true beauty of the heavens lies not only in observing the stars on a dark night but alsoin considering the delicate interplay between the physical processes that cause the stars toexist at all.The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it iscomprehensible.‚ÄîAlbert EinsteinSUGGESTED READINGGeneralAveni, Anthony,Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico, The University of Texas Press, Austin,1980.Bronowski, J.,The Ascent of Man, Little, Brown, Boston, 1973.Casper, Barry M., and Noer, Richard J.,Revolutions in Physics, W.

Hecarried out his work at the observatory, Uraniborg, on the island of Hveen (a facility providedfor him by King Frederick II of Denmark). To improve the accuracy of his observations,Tycho used large measuring instruments, such as the quadrant depicted in the mural inFig. 1(a). Tycho‚Äôs observations were so meticulous that he was able to measure the positionof an object in the heavens to an accuracy of better than 4‚Ä≤, approximately one-eighth theangular diameter of a full moon. Through the accuracy of his observations he demonstratedfor the Ô¨Årst time that comets must be much farther away than the Moon, rather than beingsome form of atmospheric phenomenon. Tycho is also credited with observing the supernovaof 1572, which clearly demonstrated that the heavens were not unchanging as Churchdoctrine held. (This observation prompted King Frederick to build Uraniborg.) Despite thegreat care with which he carried out his work, Tycho was not able to Ô¨Ånd any clear evidenceof the motion of Earth through the heavens, and he therefore concluded that the Copernicanmodel must be false.Kepler‚Äôs Laws of Planetary MotionAt Tycho‚Äôs invitation, Johannes Kepler (1571‚Äì1630), a German mathematician, joined himlater in Prague [Fig. 1(b)]. Unlike Tycho, Kepler was a heliocentrist, and it was hisdesire to Ô¨Ånd a geometrical model of the universe that would be consistent with the bestobservations then available, namely Tycho‚Äôs.After Tycho‚Äôs death, Kepler inherited the massFrom Chapter  of An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics,Second Edition, Bradley W.

Hisinitial, almost mystic, idea was that the universe is arranged with Ô¨Åve perfect solids, nestedto support the six known naked-eye planets (including Earth) on crystalline spheres, withthe entire system centered on the Sun. After this model proved unsuccessful, he attemptedto devise an accurate set of circular planetary orbits about the Sun, focusing speciÔ¨Åcally onMars. Through his very clever use of offset circles and equants,1Kepler was able to obtainexcellent agreement with Tycho‚Äôs data for all but two of the points available. In particular,the discrepant points were each off by approximately 8‚Ä≤, or twice the accuracy of Tycho‚Äôsdata. Believing that Tycho would not have made observational errors of this magnitude,Kepler felt forced to dismiss the idea of purely circular motion.Rejecting the last fundamental assumption of the Ptolemaic model, Kepler began toconsider the possibility that planetary orbits were elliptical in shape rather than circular.Through this relatively minor mathematical (though monumental philosophical) change,he was Ô¨Ånally able to bring all of Tycho‚Äôs observations into agreement with a model forplanetary motion. This paradigm shift also allowed Kepler to discover that the orbital speedof a planet is not constant but varies in a precise way depending on its location in its orbit.In 1609 Kepler published the Ô¨Årst two of his three laws of planetary motion in the bookAstronomica Nova, orThe New Astronomy:Kepler‚Äôs First LawA planet orbits the Sun in an ellipse, with the Sun at onefocus of the ellipse.Kepler‚Äôs Second LawA line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equalareas in equal time intervals.1RecallthegeocentricuseofcirclesandequantsbyPtolemy.Celestial Mechanics

The dots are evenly spaced in time.Kepler‚Äôs Ô¨Årst and second laws are illustrated in Fig. 2, where each dot on the ellipserepresents the position of the planet during evenly spaced time intervals.Kepler‚Äôs third law was published ten years later in the bookHarmonica Mundi(TheHarmony of the World).

The graph ofKepler‚Äôs third law shown in Fig. 3 was prepared using data for each planet in our SolarSyste . mIn retrospect it is easy to understand why the assumption of uniform and circular motionÔ¨Årst proposed nearly 2000 years earlier was not determined to be wrong much sooner;in most cases, planetary motion differs little from purely circular motion. In fact, it wasactually fortuitous that Kepler chose to focus on Mars, since the data for that planet wereparticularly good and Mars deviates from circular motion more than most of the others.The Geometry of Elliptical MotionTo appreciate the signiÔ¨Åcance of Kepler‚Äôs laws, we must Ô¨Årst understand the nature of theellipse.

It is often most convenient to express a planet‚Äôs orbitin polar coordinates, indicating its distancerfrom the principal focus in terms of an angleŒ∏measured counterclockwise from the major axis of the ellipse beginning with the directiontoward perihelion (see Fig. 4).

It was Galileo who proposed the earliest formulation of theconcept of inertia. He had also developed an understanding of acceleration; in particular, herealized that objects near the surface of Earth fall with the same acceleration, independentof their weight. Whether Galileo publicly proved this fact by dropping objects of differingweights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a matter of some debate.The Observations of GalileoGalileo is also the father of modern observational astronomy. Shortly after learning aboutthe 1608 invention of the Ô¨Årst crude spyglass, he thought through its design and constructedhis own. Using his new telescope to carefully observe the heavens, Galileo quickly madea number of important observations in support of the heliocentric model of the universe.In particular, he discovered that the band of light known as the Milky Way, which runsfrom horizon to horizon, is not merely a cloud, as had previously been supposed, but

actually contains an enormous number of individual stars not resolvable by the naked eye.Galileo also observed that the Moon possesses craters and therefore is not a perfect sphere.Observations of the varying phases of Venus implied that the planet does not shine by its ownpower, but must be reÔ¨Çecting sunlight from constantly changing angles relative to the Sunand Earth while it orbits the Sun. He also discovered that the Sun itself is blemished, havingsunspots that vary in number and location. But perhaps the most damaging observation forthe geocentric model, a model still strongly supported by the Church, was the discovery offour moons in orbit about Jupiter, indicating the existence of at least one other center ofmotion in the universe.Many of Galileo‚Äôs Ô¨Årst observations were published in his bookSidereus Nuncius(TheStarry Messenger) in 1610. By 1616 the Church forced him to withdraw his support of theCopernican model, although he was able to continue his study of astronomy for some years.In 1632 Galileo published another work,The Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems,i nwhich a three-character play was staged. In the play Salviati was the proponent of Galileo‚Äôsviews, Simplicio believed in the oldAristotelian view, and Sagredo acted as the neutral thirdparty who was invariably swayed by Salviati‚Äôs arguments. In a strong reaction, Galileo wascalled before the Roman Inquisition and his book was heavily censored. The book was thenplaced on theIndexof banned books, a collection of titles that included works of Copernicusand Kepler. Galileo was put under house arrest for the remainder of his life, serving out histerm at his home in Florence.In 1992, after a 13-year study by Vatican experts, Pope John Paul II ofÔ¨Åcially announcedthat, because of a ‚Äútragic mutual incomprehension,‚Äù the Roman Catholic Church had erredin its condemnation of Galileo some 360 years earlier. By reevaluating its position, theChurch demonstrated that, at least on this issue, there is room for the philosophical viewsof both science and religion.Newton‚Äôs Three Laws of MotionIsaac Newton (1642‚Äì1727), arguably the greatest of any scientiÔ¨Åc mind in history[Fig. 6(b)], was born on Christmas Day in the year of Galileo‚Äôs death. At age 18, Newtonenrolled at Cambridge University and subsequently obtained his bachelor‚Äôs degree. In thetwo years following the completion of his formal studies, and while living at home in Wool-sthorpe, in rural England, away from the immediate dangers of the Plague, Newton engagedin what was likely the most productive period of scientiÔ¨Åc work ever carried out by oneindividual. During that interval, he made signiÔ¨Åcant discoveries and theoretical advancesin understanding motion, astronomy, optics, and mathematics. Although his work was notpublished immediately, thePhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica(MathematicalPrinciples of Natural Philosophy), now simply known as thePrincipia, Ô¨Ånally appearedin 1687 and contained much of his work on mechanics, gravitation, and the calculus. Thepublication of thePrincipiacame about largely as a result of the urging of Edmond Halley,who paid for its printing. Another book,Optiks, appeared separately in 1704 and containedNewton‚Äôs ideas about the nature of light and some of his early experiments in optics.Although many of his ideas concerning the particle nature of light were later shown to bein error,muchofNewton‚Äôsotherworkisstillusedextensivelytoday.Newton‚Äôs great intellect is evidenced in his solution of the so-called brachistochroneproblem posed by Johann Bernoulli, the Swiss mathematician, as a challenge to his col-Celestial Mechanics

leagues. The brachistochrone problem amounts to Ô¨Ånding the curve along which a beadcould slide over a frictionless wire in the least amount of time while under the inÔ¨Çuenceonly of gravity. The deadline for Ô¨Ånding a solution was set at a year and a half. The problemwas presented to Newton late one afternoon; by the next morning he had found the answerby inventing a new area of mathematics known as the calculus of variations. Although thesolution was published anonymously at Newton‚Äôs request, Bernoulli commented, ‚ÄúBy theclaw, the lion is revealed.‚ÄùConcerning the successes of his own career, Newton wrote:I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to havebeen only like a boy, playing on the seashore, and diverting myself, in now andthen Ô¨Ånding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the greatocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.Today, classical mechanics is described by Newton‚Äôs three laws of motion, along with hisuniversallaw of gravity. Outside of the realms of atomic dimensions, velocities approachingthe speed of light, or extreme gravitational forces, Newtonian physics has proved verysuccessful in explaining the results of observations and experiments. Those regimes whereNewtonian mechanics have been shown to be unsatisfactory will be discussed in laterchapters.Newton‚Äôs Ô¨Årst law of motion may be stated as follows:Newton‚Äôs First LawThe Law of Inertia.An object at rest will remain at restand an object in motion will remain in motion in a straight line at a constantspeed unless acted upon by an external force.To establish whether an object is actually moving, a reference frame must be established. Inlater chapters we will refer to reference frames that have the special property that the Ô¨Årstlaw is valid; all such frames are known asinertial reference frames. Noninertial referenceframes are accelerated with respect to inertial frames.The Ô¨Årst law may be restated in terms of the momentum of an object,p=mv, wheremandvare mass and velocity, respectively.2Thus Newton‚Äôs Ô¨Årst law may be expressed as‚Äúthe momentum of an object remains constant unless it experiences an external force.‚Äù3The second law is actually a deÔ¨Ånition of the concept of force:Newton‚Äôs Second LawThenetforce (the sum of all forces) acting on an objectis proportional to the object‚Äôs mass and its resultant acceleration.If an object is experiencingnforces, then the net force is given byFnet=n‚éùsummationdisplayi=1Fi=ma.(9)2Hereafter, all vectors will be indicated by boldface type. Vectors are quantities described by both a magnitudeand a direction. Some texts use alternate notations for vectors, expressing them either as‚Éóvor‚Éóv.3The law of inertia is an extension of the original concept developed by Galileo.Celestial Mechanics

Mathematically, thethird law can be represented asF12=‚àíF21.Newton‚Äôs Law of Universal GravitationUsing his three laws of motion along with Kepler‚Äôs third law, Newton was able to Ô¨Ånd anexpression describing the force that holds planets in their orbits. Consider the special caseofcircularorbital motion of a massmabout a much larger massM(M‚â´m). Allowingfor a system of units other than years and astronomical units, Kepler‚Äôs third law may bewritten asP2=kr3,whereris the distance between the two objects andkis a constant of proportionality.

Rearranging terms and multiplying both sides bymlead to the expressionmv2r=4œÄ2mkr2.The left-hand side of the equation may be recognized as the centripetal force for circularmotion, soF=4œÄ2mkr2must be the gravitational force keepingmin its orbit aboutM. However, Newton‚Äôs thirdlaw states that the magnitude of the force exerted onMbymmust equal the magnitude ofthe force exerted onmbyM. Therefore, the form of the equation ought to be symmetricwith respect to exchange ofmandM, implyingF=4œÄ2Mk‚Ä≤r2.Expressing this symmetry explicitly and grouping the remaining constants into a new con-stant, we haveF=4œÄ2Mmk‚Ä≤‚Ä≤r2,wherek=k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤/Mandk‚Ä≤=k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤/m.

In particular, for anextended object (as opposed to a point mass), the force exerted by that object on anotherextended object may be found by integrating over each of their mass distributions.Example1.The force exerted by aspherically symmetricobject of massMon a pointmassmmay be found by integrating over rings centered along a line connecting the pointmass to the center of the extended object (see Fig. 8). In this way all points on a speciÔ¨Åcring are located at the same distance fromm. Furthermore, because of the symmetry ofthe ring, the gravitational force vector associated with it is oriented along the ring‚Äôs centralaxis. Once a general description of the force due to one ring is determined, it is possible toadd up the individual contributions from all such rings throughout the entire volume of themassM.

Work and EnergyIn astrophysics, as in any area of physics, it is often very helpful to have some understand-ing of the energetics of speciÔ¨Åc physical phenomena in order to determine whether theseprocesses are important in certain systems. Some models may be ruled out immediatelyif they are incapable of producing the amount of energy observed. Energy arguments alsooften result in simpler solutions to particular problems. For example, in the evolution of aplanetary atmosphere, the possibility of a particular component of the atmosphere escapingmust be considered. Such a consideration is based on a calculation of the escape speed ofthe gas particles.The amount of energy (the work) necessary to raise an object of massma heighthagainst a gravitational force is equal to the change in thepotential energyof the system.Generally, the change in potential energy resulting from a change in position between twopoints is given byUf‚àíUi=/Delta1U=‚àí‚éùintegraldisplayrfriF¬∑dr,(13)whereFis the force vector,riandrfare the initial andÔ¨Ånal position vectors, respectively,anddris the inÔ¨Ånitesimal change in the position vector for some general coordinate system(see Fig. 9).

Since onlyrelative changesin potential energy are physically meaningful, a referenceposition where the potential energy is deÔ¨Åned as being identically zero may be chosen. If,for a speciÔ¨Åc gravitational system, it is assumed that the potential energy goes to zero atinÔ¨Ånity, lettingrfapproach inÔ¨Ånity (rf‚Üí‚àû) and dropping the subscripts for simplicitygiveU=‚àíGMmr.(14)Of course, the process can be reversed: The force may be found bydifferentiatingthegravitational potential energy. For forces that depend only onr,F=‚àí‚àÇU‚àÇr.(15)In a general three-dimensional description,F=‚àí ‚àáU, where‚àáUrepresents thegradientofU. In rectangular coordinates this becomesF=‚àí‚àÇU‚àÇxÀÜi‚àí‚àÇU‚àÇyÀÜj‚àí‚àÇU‚àÇzÀÜk.Work must be performed on a massive object if itsspeed,|v|, is to be changed.

We may now identify the quantityK=12mv2(16)as thekinetic energyof the object. Thus work done on the particle results in an equiva-lent change in the particle‚Äôs kinetic energy. This statement is simply one example of theconservation of energy, a concept that is encountered frequently in all areas of physics.Consider a particle of massmthat has an initial velocityvand is at a distancerfromthe center of a larger massM, such as Earth. How fast must the mass be moving upward tocompletely escape the pull of gravity? To calculate theescape speed, energy conservationmay be used directly. The total initial mechanical energy of the particle (both kinetic andpotential) is given byE=12mv2‚àíGMmr.Assume that, in the critical case, theÔ¨Ånal velocity of the mass will be zero at a positioninÔ¨Ånitely far fromM, implying that both the kinetic and potential energy will become zero.Clearly, by conservation of energy, thetotalenergy of the particle must be identically zeroat all times. Thus12mv2=GMmr,which may be solved immediately for the initial speed ofmto givevesc=‚éùradicalbig2GM/r.(17)Notice that the mass of the escaping object does not enter into theÔ¨Ånal expression for theescape speed.

This constraint exists because of the equal magnitudes and opposite directionsof action‚Äìreaction pairs. Of course, the momentum of individual masses may change. Usingcenter-of-mass quantities, weÔ¨Ånd that the total (or net) force on the system isF=dPdt=Md2Rdt2=0.Therefore, the center of mass will not accelerate if no external forces exist. This impliesthat a reference frame associated with the center of mass must be an inertial reference frameand that theN-body problem may be simpliÔ¨Åed by choosing a coordinate system for whichthe center of mass is at rest atR=0.If we choose a center-of-mass reference frame for a binary system, depicted in Fig. 11(R=0), Eq.

The result is an important general statement concerning angular momentum:dLdt=0,(27)the angular momentum of a system is a constant for a central force law. Equation ( 26)further shows that the position vectorris always perpendicular to the constant angularmomentum vectorL, meaning that the orbit of the reduced mass lies in a plane perpendiculartoL.Using the radial unit vectorÀÜr(sor=rÀÜr), we can write the angular momentum vectorin an alternative form asL=¬µr√óv=¬µrÀÜr√óddt(rÀÜr)Celestial Mechanics

For our Solar System, such a mistake is understandable, since the largest ofthe planets, Jupiter, has only 1/1000 the mass of the Sun. This places the center of massof the Sun‚ÄìJupiter system near the surface of the Sun.

FIGURE 14The velocity vector for elliptical motion in polar coordinates.It has already been shown that the orbital angular momentum is a constant, sothe time rateof change of the area swept out by a line connecting a planet to the focus of an ellipse isa constant, one-half of the orbital angular momentum per unit mass. This is just Kepler‚Äôssecond law.Expressions for the speed of the reduced mass at perihelion (Œ∏=0) and aphelion (Œ∏=œÄ/2) may be easily obtained from Eq. ( 29). Since at both perihelion and aphelion,randvare perpendicular, the magnitude of the angular momentum at these points simply becomesL=¬µrv.Eq. ( 29) at perihelion may thus be written asrp=(¬µrpvp)2/¬µ2GM(1+e),whereas at aphelionra=(¬µrava)2/¬µ2GM(1‚àíe).RecallingfromExample.1thatrp=a(1‚àíe)at perihelion andra=a(1+e)at aphe-lion, we immediately obtainv2p=GM(1+e)rp=GMa‚éùparenleftbigg1+e1‚àíe‚éùparenrightbigg(33)at perihelion andv2a=GM(1‚àíe)ra=GMa‚éùparenleftbigg1‚àíe1+e‚éùparenrightbigg.(34)at aphelion.

The total orbital energy may be found as well:E=12¬µv2p‚àíGM¬µrp.Making the appropriate substitutions, and after some rearrangement,E=‚àíGM¬µ2a=‚àíGm1m22a.(35)The total energy of a binary orbit depends only on the semimajor axisaand is exactlyone-half the time-averaged potential energy of the system,E=12‚ü®U‚ü©,where‚ü®U‚ü©denotes an average over one orbital period.5This is one example of thevirialtheorem, a general property of gravitationally bound systems. The virial theorem will bediscussedindetailinSection4.A useful expression for the velocity of the reduced mass (or the relative velocity ofm1andm2) may be found directly by using the conservation of energy and equating the totalorbital energy to the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:‚àíGM¬µ2a=12¬µv2‚àíGM¬µr.Using the identityM=m1+m2, this simpliÔ¨Åes to givev2=G(m1+m2)‚éùparenleftbigg2r‚àí1a‚éùparenrightbigg.(36)This expression could also have been obtained directly by adding the vector componentsof orbital velocity.

Integrating the mathematicalexpression for Kepler‚Äôs second law (Eq. 32) over one orbital period,P, gives the resultA=12L¬µP.Here the massmorbiting about a much largerÔ¨ÅxedmassMhas been replaced by the moregeneral reduced mass¬µorbiting about the center of mass.

A=œÄab, squaring the equation, and rearranging, we obtain the expressionP2=4œÄ2a2b2¬µ2L2.Finally, using Eq. ( 2) and the expression for the total orbital angular momentum (Eq. 30),the last equation simpliÔ¨Åes to becomeKepler‚Äôs Third Law (revisited)P2=4œÄ2G(m1+m2)a3.(37)This is the general form of Kepler‚Äôs third law. Not only did Newton demonstrate the re-lationship between the semimajor axis of an elliptical orbit and the orbital period, he alsofound a term not discovered empirically by Kepler, the square of the orbital period is in-versely proportional to the total mass of the system. Once again Kepler can be forgivenfor not noticing the effect. Tycho‚Äôs data were for our Solar System only, and because theSun‚Äôs massM‚äôis so much greater than the mass of any of the planets,M‚äô+mplanet‚âÉM‚äô.ExpressingPin years andain astronomical units gives a value of unity for the collectionof constants (including the Sun‚Äôs mass).6The importance to astronomy of Newton‚Äôs form of Kepler‚Äôs third law cannot be over-stated. This law provides the most direct way of obtaining masses of celestial objects, acritical parameter in understanding a wide range of phenomena. Kepler‚Äôs laws, as derivedby Newton, apply equally well to planets orbiting the Sun, moons orbiting planets, starsin orbit about one another, and galaxy‚Äìgalaxy orbits. Knowledge of the period of an orbitand the semimajor axis of the ellipse yields the total mass of the system. If relative dis-tances to the center of mass are also known, the individual masses may be determined usingEq. ( 19).Example 3.1.The orbital sidereal period of Io, one of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter,is 1.77 days=1.53√ó105s and the semimajor axis of its orbit is 4.22√ó108m. Assumingthat the mass of Io is insigniÔ¨Åcant compared to that of Jupiter, the mass of the planet maybe estimated using Kepler‚Äôs third law:MJupiter=4œÄ2Ga3P2=1.90√ó1027kg=318 M‚äï.discussedinthischapter.mass that is orbiting about a much larger star (or it may be thought of as calculating themotion of the reduced mass about the total mass).

4THE VIRIAL THEOREMIn the last section we found that the total energy of the binary orbit was just one-half ofthe time-averaged gravitational potential energy (Eq. 35), orE=‚ü®U‚ü©/2. Since the totalenergy of the system is negative, the system is necessarily bound. For gravitationally boundsystems in equilibrium, it can be shown that the total energy is always one-half of thetime-averaged potential energy; this is known as thevirial theorem.To prove the virial theorem, begin by considering the quantityQ‚â°‚éùsummationdisplayipi¬∑ri,wherepiandriare the linear momentum and position vectors for particleiin some inertialreference frame, and the sum is taken to be over all particles in the system. The timederivative ofQisdQdt=‚éùsummationdisplayi‚éùparenleftbiggdpidt¬∑ri+pi¬∑dridt‚éùparenrightbigg.(38)Now, the left-hand side of the expression is justdQdt=ddt‚éùsummationdisplayimidridt¬∑ri=ddt‚éùsummationdisplayi12ddt‚éùparenleftbigmir2i‚éùparenrightbig=12d2Idt2,whereI=‚éùsummationdisplayimir2iis themoment of inertiaof the collection of particles.

If we use Newton‚Äôs second law,Eq.

Even if the system being considered is notstrictly periodic, the average will still approach zero when evaluated over a sufÔ¨Åcientlylong period of time (i.e.,œÑ‚Üí‚àû), assuming of course thatdI/dtis bounded. This woulddescribe, for example, a system that has reached an equilibrium or steady-state conÔ¨Åguration.In either case, we now have‚éùangbracketleftbigd2I/dt2‚éùangbracketrightbig=0, so‚àí2‚ü®K‚ü©=‚ü®U‚ü©.(46)This result is one form of the virial theorem. The theorem may also be expressed in termsof the total energy of the system by using the relation‚ü®E‚ü©=‚ü®K‚ü©+‚ü®U‚ü©. Thus‚ü®E‚ü©=12‚ü®U‚ü©,(47)just what we found for the binary orbit problem.The virial theorem applies to a wide variety of systems, from an ideal gas to a clusterof galaxies. For instance, consider the case of a static star. In equilibrium a star must obeythe virial theorem, implying that its total energy is negative, one-half of the total potentialenergy. Assuming that the star formed as a result of the gravitational collapse of a largeCelestial Mechanics

cloud (a nebula), the potential energy of the system must have changed from an initial valueof nearly zero to its negative static value. This implies that the star must have lost energy inthe process, meaning that gravitational energy must have been radiated into space duringthe collapse. Applications of the virial theorem will be described in more detail in laterchapters.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralKuhn, Thomas S.,The Structure of ScientiÔ¨Åc Revolutions, Third Edition, University ofChicago Press, Chicago, 1996.Westfall, Richard S.,Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton, Cambridge UniversityPress, Cambridge, 1980.TechnicalArya, Atam P.,Introduction to Classical Mechanics, Second Edition, Prentice Hall, UpperSaddle River, NJ, 1998.Clayton, Donald D.,Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, University ofChicago Press, New York, 1983.Fowles, Grant R., and Cassiday, George L.,Analytical Mechanics, Seventh Edition, Thom-son Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA, 2005.Marion, Jerry B., and Thornton, Stephen T.,Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems,Fourth Edition, Saunders College Publishing, Fort Worth, 1995.Celestial Mechanics

The Continuous Spectrum of Light1Stellar Parallax2The Magnitude Scale3The Wave Nature of Light4Blackbody Radiation5The Quantization of Energy6The Color Index1STELLAR PARALLAXMeasuring the intrinsic brightness of stars is inextricably linked with determining theirdistances. This chapter on the light emitted by stars therefore begins with the problem ofÔ¨Ånding the distance to astronomical objects, one of the most important and most difÔ¨Åculttasks faced by astronomers. Kepler‚Äôs laws in their original form describe therelativesizesof the planets‚Äô orbits in terms of astronomical units; their actual dimensions were unknownto Kepler and his contemporaries. The true scale of the Solar System was Ô¨Årst revealedin 1761 when the distance to Venus was measured as it crossed the disk of the Sun ina rare transit during inferior conjunction. The method used wastrigonometric parallax,the familiar surveyor‚Äôs technique of triangulation. On Earth, the distance to the peak ofa remote mountain can be determined by measuring that peak‚Äôs angular position fromtwo observation points separated by a known baseline distance. Simple trigonometry thensupplies the distance to the peak; see Fig. 1. Similarly, the distances to the planets can bemeasured from two widely separated observation sites on Earth.Finding the distance even to the nearest stars requires a longer baseline than Earth‚Äôsdiameter. As Earth orbits the Sun, two observations of the same star made 6 months apartemploy a baseline equal to the diameter of Earth‚Äôs orbit. These measurements reveal that anearby star exhibits an annual back-and-forth change in its position against the stationaryd=1 AUtanp‚âÉ1pAU,From Chapter  of An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics,Second Edition, Bradley W.

However, this proper motion, seen from Earth, is not pe-riodic and so can be distinguished from the star‚Äôs periodic displacement caused by Earth‚Äôs orbital motion. As shown in Fig. 2, a measurement of the parallax angle p (one-half of the maximum change in angular position) allows the calculation of the distance d to the star.A star may also change its position as a consequence

Even Proxima Centauri, the nearest star other than the Sun, has a parallax angle of lessthan 1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. (Proxima Centauri is a member of the triple star systemŒ±Centauri, and has aparallax angle of 0.77‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. If Earth‚Äôs orbit around the Sun were represented by a dime, thenProxima Centauri would be located 2.4 km away!) In fact, this cyclic change in a star‚Äôsposition is so difÔ¨Åcult to detect that it was not until 1838 that it was Ô¨Årst measured, byFriedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784‚Äì1846), a German mathematician and astronomer.1Example 1.1.In 1838, after 4 years of observing 61 Cygni, Bessel announced his mea-surement of a parallax angle of 0.316‚Ä≤‚Ä≤for that star. This corresponds to a distance ofd=1p‚Ä≤‚Ä≤pc=10.316pc=3.16 pc=10.3 ly,within 10% of the modern value 3.48 pc. 61 Cygni is one of the Sun‚Äôs nearest neighbors.From 1989 to 1993, the European Space Agency‚Äôs (ESA‚Äôs) Hipparcos Space AstrometryMission operated high above Earth‚Äôs distorting atmosphere.2The spacecraft was able tomeasure parallax angles with accuracies approaching 0.001‚Ä≤‚Ä≤for over 118,000 stars, cor-responding to a distance of 1000 pc‚â°1 kpc (kiloparsec). Along with the high-precisionHipparcos experiment aboard the spacecraft, the lower-precision Tycho experiment pro-duced a catalog of more than 1 million stars with parallaxes down to 0.02‚Ä≤‚Ä≤‚Äì0.03‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. Thetwo catalogs were published in 1997 and are available on CD-ROMs and the World WideWeb. Despite the impressive accuracy of the Hipparcos mission, the distances that wereobtained are still quite small compared to the 8-kpc distance to the center of our Milky WayGalaxy, so stellar trigonometric parallax is currently useful only for surveying the localneighborhood of the Sun.However, within the next decade, NASA plans to launch the Space Interferometry Mis-sion (SIM PlanetQuest). This observatory will be able to determine positions, distances,and proper motions of stars with parallax angles as small as 4microarcseconds (0.000004‚Ä≤‚Ä≤),leading to the direct determination of distances of objects up to 250 kpc away, assuming thatthe objects are bright enough. In addition, ESA will launch theGaiamission within the nextdecade as well, which will catalog the brightest 1 billion stars with parallax angles as smallas 10 microarcseconds. With the anticipated levels of accuracy, these missions will be ableto catalog stars and other objects across the Milky Way Galaxy and even in nearby galaxies.Clearly these ambitious projects will provide an amazing wealth of new information aboutthe three-dimensional structure of our Galaxy and the nature of its constituents.1Tycho Brahe had searched for stellar parallax 250 years earlier, but his instruments were too imprecise to Ô¨Ånd it.Tycho concluded that Earth does not move through space, and he was thus unable to accept Copernicus‚Äôs modelof a heliocentric Solar System.2Astrometryis the subdiscipline of astronomy that is concerned with the three-dimensional positions of celestialobjects.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

2THE MAGNITUDE SCALENearly all of the information astronomers have received about the universe beyond ourSolar System has come from the careful study of the light emitted by stars, galaxies, andinterstellar clouds of gas and dust. Our modern understanding of the universe has been madepossible by the quantitative measurement of the intensity and polarization of light in everypart of the electromagnetic spectrum.Apparent MagnitudeThe Greek astronomer Hipparchus was one of the Ô¨Årst sky watchers to catalog the starsthat he saw. In addition to compiling a list of the positions of some 850 stars, Hipparchusinvented a numerical scale to describe how bright each star appeared in the sky. He assignedanapparent magnitudem=1 to the brightest stars in the sky, and he gave the dimmeststars visible to the naked eye an apparent magnitude ofm=6. Note that a smaller apparentmagnitude means a brighter-appearing star.Since Hipparchus‚Äôs time, astronomers have extended and reÔ¨Åned his apparent magnitudescale. In the nineteenth century, it was thought that the human eye responded to the differencein thelogarithmsof the brightness of two luminous objects. This theory led to a scale inwhich a difference of 1 magnitude between two stars implies a constantratiobetween theirbrightnesses. By the modern deÔ¨Ånition, a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds exactlyto a factor of 100 in brightness, so a difference of 1 magnitude corresponds exactly to abrightness ratio of 1001/5‚âÉ2.512. Thus a Ô¨Årst-magnitude star appears 2.512 times brighterthan a second-magnitude star, 2.5122=6.310 times brighter than a third-magnitude star,and 100 times brighter than a sixth-magnitude star.Using sensitive detectors, astronomers can measure the apparent magnitude of an objectwith an accuracy of¬±0.01 magnitude, anddifferencesin magnitudes with an accuracy of¬±0.002 magnitude. Hipparchus‚Äôs scale has been extended in both directions, fromm=‚àí26.83 for the Sun to approximatelym=30 for the faintest object detectable.3The totalrange of nearly 57 magnitudes corresponds to over 10057/5=(102)11.4‚âÉ1023for the ratioof the apparent brightness of the Sun to that of the faintest star or galaxy yet observed.Flux, Luminosity, and the Inverse Square LawThe ‚Äúbrightness‚Äù of a star is actually measured in terms of theradiant Ô¨ÇuxFreceived fromthe star. The radiant Ô¨Çux is the total amount of light energy of all wavelengths that crossesa unit area oriented perpendicular to the direction of the light‚Äôs travel per unit time; that is,it is the number of joules of starlight energy per second (i.e., the number of watts) receivedby one square meter of a detector aimed at the star. Of course, the radiant Ô¨Çux receivedfrom an object depends on both its intrinsicluminosity(energy emitted per second) and itsdistance from the observer. The same star, if located farther from Earth, would appear lessbright in the sky.3The magnitudes discussed in this section are actuallybolometricmagnitudes, measured over all wavelengths oflight; see Section 6 for a discussion of magnitudes measured by detectors over a Ô¨Ånite wavelength region.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

Imagine a star of luminosityLsurrounded by a huge spherical shell of radiusr. Then,assuming that no light is absorbed during its journey out to the shell, the radiant Ô¨Çux,F,measured at distanceris related to the star‚Äôs luminosity byF=L4œÄr2,(2)the denominator being simply the area of the sphere. SinceLdoes not depend onr, theradiant Ô¨Çux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. This is thewell-knowninverse square lawfor light.4Example 2.1.The luminosity of the Sun isL‚äô=3.839√ó1026W. At a distance of1 AU=1.496√ó1011m, Earth receives a radiant Ô¨Çux above its absorbing atmosphere ofF=L4œÄr2=1365 W m‚àí2.This value of the solar Ô¨Çux is known as thesolar irradiance, sometimes also called thesolar constant. At a distance of 10 pc=2.063√ó106AU, an observer would measure theradiant Ô¨Çux to be only 1/(2.063√ó106)2as large. That is, the radiant Ô¨Çux from the Sunwould be 3.208√ó10‚àí10Wm‚àí2at a distance of 10 pc.Absolute MagnitudeUsing the inverse square law, astronomers can assign anabsolute magnitude,M, to eachstar. This is deÔ¨Åned to be the apparent magnitude a star would haveifit were located at adistance of 10 pc. Recall that a difference of 5 magnitudes between the apparent magnitudesof two stars corresponds to the smaller-magnitude star being 100 times brighter than thelarger-magnitude star. This allows us to specify their Ô¨Çux ratio asF2F1=100(m1‚àím2)/5.(3)Taking the logarithm of both sides leads to the alternative form:m1‚àím2=‚àí2.5 log10/parenleftbiggF1F2/parenrightbigg.(4)The Distance ModulusThe connection between a star‚Äôs apparent and absolute magnitudes and its distance may befound by combining Eqs. (2) and (3):100(m‚àíM)/5=F10F=/parenleftbiggd10 pc/parenrightbigg2,4If the star is moving with a speed near that of light, the inverse square law must be modiÔ¨Åed slightly.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

whereF10is the Ô¨Çux that would be received if the star were at a distance of 10 pc, anddisthe star‚Äôs distance, measured inparsecs. Solving fordgivesd=10(m‚àíM+5)/5pc.(5)The quantitym‚àíMis therefore a measure of the distance to a star and is called the star‚Äôsdistance modulus:m‚àíM=5 log10(d)‚àí5=5 log10/parenleftbiggd10 pc/parenrightbigg.(6)Example2..The apparent magnitude of the Sun ismSun=‚àí26.83, and its distance is1 AU=4.848√ó10‚àí6pc. Equation (6) shows that the absolute magnitude of the Sun isMSun=mSun‚àí5 log10(d)+5=+4.74,as already given. The Sun‚Äôs distance modulus is thusmSun‚àíMSun=‚àí31.57.5For two stars at the same distance, Eq. ( 2) shows that the ratio of their radiant Ô¨Çuxesis equal to the ratio of their luminosities. Thus Eq. ( 3) for absolute magnitudes becomes100(M1‚àíM2)/5=L2L1.(7)Letting one of these stars be the Sun reveals the direct relation between a star‚Äôs absolutemagnitude and its luminosity:M=MSun‚àí2.5 log10/parenleftbiggLL‚äô/parenrightbigg,(8)where the absolute magnitude and luminosity of the Sun areMSun=+4.74 andL‚äô=3.839√ó1026W, respectively.

Equation ( 5) then gives the distance to the variable star.the universe.3THE WAVE NATURE OF LIGHTMuch of the history of physics is concerned with the evolution of our ideas about the natureof light.The Speed of LightThe speed of light was Ô¨Årst measured with some accuracy in 1675, by the Danish astronomerOle Roemer (1644‚Äì1710). Roemer observed the moons of Jupiter as they passed into thegiant planet‚Äôs shadow, and he was able to calculate when future eclipses of the moons shouldoccur by using Kepler‚Äôs laws. However, Roemer discovered that when Earth was movingcloser to Jupiter, the eclipses occurred earlier than expected. Similarly, when Earth wasmoving away from Jupiter, the eclipses occurred behind schedule. Roemer realized thatthe discrepancy was caused by the differing amounts of time it took for light to travel thechanging distance between the two planets, and he concluded that 22 minutes was requiredfor light to cross the diameter of Earth‚Äôs orbit.6The resulting value of 2.2√ó108ms‚àí1wasclose to the modern value of the speed of light. In 1983 the speed of lightin vacuowasformallydeÔ¨Ånedto bec=2.99792458√ó108ms‚àí1, and the unit of length (the meter) isnow derived from this value.7Young‚Äôs Double-Slit ExperimentEven the fundamental nature of light has long been debated. Isaac Newton, for example,believed that light must consist of a rectilinear stream of particles, because only such astream could account for the sharpness of shadows. Christian Huygens (1629‚Äì1695), acontemporary of Newton, advanced the idea that light must consist of waves. Accordingto Huygens, light is described by the usual quantities appropriate for a wave. The distancebetween two successive wave crests is thewavelengthŒª, and the number of waves persecond that pass a point in space is thefrequencyŒΩof the wave. Then the speed of the lightwave is given byc=ŒªŒΩ.(10)6We now know that it takes light about 16.5 minutes to travel 2 AU.7In 1905Albert Einstein realized that the speed of light is a universal constant of nature whose value is independentof the observe . This realization plays a central role in his Special Theory of Relativity.These stars act as beacons that illuminate the fundamental distance scale of

(b) Destructiveinterference.Both the particle and wave models could explain the familiar phenomena of the reÔ¨Çectionand refraction of light. However, the particle model prevailed, primarily on the strengthof Newton‚Äôs reputation, until the wave nature of light was conclusively demonstrated byThomas Young‚Äôs (1773‚Äì1829) famous double-slit experiment.In a double-slit experiment, monochromatic light of wavelengthŒªfrom a single sourcepasses through two narrow, parallel slits that are separated by a distanced. The light thenfalls upon a screen a distanceLbeyond the two slits (see Fig. 3). The series of lightand darkinterference fringesthat Young observed on the screen could be explained onlyby a wave model of light. As the light waves pass through the narrow slits,8they spreadout (diffract) radially in a succession of crests and troughs. Light obeys asuperpositionprinciple, so when two waves meet, they add algebraically; see Fig. 4. At the screen, if awave crest from one slit meets a wave crest from the other slit, a bright fringe or maximum isproduced by the resultingconstructive interference. But if a wave crest from one slit meetsa wave trough from the other slit, they cancel each other, and a dark fringe or minimumresults from thisdestructive interference.The interference pattern observed thus depends on the difference in the lengths of thepaths traveled by the light waves from the two slits to the screen. As shown in Fig. 3,ifL‚â´d, then to a good approximation this path difference isdsinŒ∏. The light waveswill arrive at the screenin phaseif the path difference is equal to an integral number ofwavelengths. On the other hand, the light waves will arrive 180‚ó¶out of phaseif the pathdifference is equal to an odd integral number of half-wavelengths. So forL‚â´d, the angular8Actually, Young used pinholes in his original experiment.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

From the measuredpositions of the light and dark fringes on the screen, Young was able to determine thewavelength of the light. At the short-wavelength end, Young found that violet light hasa wavelength of approximately 400 nm, while at the long-wavelength end, red light hasa wavelength of only 700 nm.9The diffraction of light goes unnoticed under everydayconditions for these short wavelengths, thus explaining Newton‚Äôs sharp shadows.Maxwell‚Äôs Electromagnetic Wave TheoryThe nature of these waves of light remained elusive until the early 1860s, when the Scottishmathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831‚Äì1879) succeeded in condensing every-thing known about electric and magnetic Ô¨Åelds into the four equations that today bear hisname. Maxwell found that his equations could be manipulated to produce wave equationsfor the electric and magnetic Ô¨Åeld vectorsEandB. These wave equations predicted theexistence ofelectromagnetic wavesthat travel through a vacuum with speedv=1/‚àöœµ0¬µ0,whereœµ0and¬µ0are fundamental constants associated with the electric and magnetic Ô¨Åelds,respectively. Upon inserting the values ofœµ0and¬µ0, Maxwell was amazed to discoverthat electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. Furthermore, these equations im-plied that electromagnetic waves aretransversewaves, with the oscillatory electric andmagnetic Ô¨Åelds perpendicular to each otherandto the direction of the wave‚Äôs propagation(see Fig. 5); such waves could exhibit the polarization10known to occur for light. Max-well wrote that ‚Äúwe can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transversemodulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.‚ÄùMaxwell did not live to see the experimental veriÔ¨Åcation of his prediction of electro-magnetic waves. Ten years after Maxwell‚Äôs death, the German physicist Heinrich Hertz(1857‚Äì1894) succeeded in producing radio waves in his laboratory. Hertz determined thatthese electromagnetic waves do indeed travel at the speed of light, and he conÔ¨Årmed theirreÔ¨Çection, refraction, and polarization properties. In 1889, Hertz wrote:What is light? Since the time of Young and Fresnel we know that it is wavemotion.We know the velocity of the waves, we know their lengths, and we knowthat they are transverse; in short, our knowledge of the geometrical conditionsof the motion is complete. A doubt about these things is no longer possible; arefutation of these views is inconceivable to the physicist. The wave theory oflight is, from the point of view of human beings, certainty.9Another commonly used measure of the wavelength of light is theangstrom;1√Ö=0.1 nm. In these units, violetlight has a wavelength of 4000 √Ö and red light has a wavelength of 7000 √Ö.10The electromagnetic wave shown in Fig. 5 isplane-polarized, with its electric and magnetic Ô¨Åelds oscillatingin planes. BecauseEandBare always perpendicular, their respective planes of polarization are perpendicular aswell.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

Because the magnitudes of the Ô¨ÅeldsEandBvary harmonically with time, thequantity of practical interest is thetime-averagedvalue of the Poynting vector over one cy-cle of the electromagnetic wave. In a vacuum the magnitude of the time-averaged Poyntingvector,‚ü®S‚ü©, is‚ü®S‚ü©=12¬µ0E0B0,(12)whereE0andB0are the maximum magnitudes (amplitudes) of the electric and magneticÔ¨Åelds, respectively. (For an electromagnetic wave in a vacuum,E0andB0are related byE0=cB0.) The time-averaged Poynting vector thus provides a description of the radiantÔ¨Çux in terms of the electric and magnetic Ô¨Åelds of the light waves. However, it should beremembered that the radiant Ô¨Çux discussed in Section 2 involves the amount of energyreceivedat all wavelengthsfrom a star, whereasE0andB0describe an electromagneticwave of a speciÔ¨Åed wavelength.Because an electromagnetic wave carries momentum, it can exert a force on a surfacehit by the light. The resultingradiation pressuredepends on whether the light is reÔ¨Çectedfrom or absorbed by the surface. Referring to Fig. 6, if the light is completely absorbed,then the force due to radiation pressure is in the direction of the light‚Äôs propagation and hasmagnitudeFrad=‚ü®S‚ü©AccosŒ∏(absorption),(13)whereŒ∏is the angle of incidence of the light as measured from the direction perpendicularto the surface of areaA. Alternatively, if the light is completely reÔ¨Çected, then the radiationpressure force must act in a direction perpendicular to the surface; the reÔ¨Çected light cannotexert a force parallel to the surface. Then the magnitude of the force isFrad=2‚ü®S‚ü©Accos2Œ∏(reÔ¨Çection).(14)Radiation pressure has a negligible effect on physical systems under everyday conditions.However, radiation pressure may play a dominant role in determining some aspects of thebehavior of extremely luminous objects such as early main-sequence stars, red supergiants,and accreting compact stars. It may also have a signiÔ¨Åcant effect on the small particles ofdust found throughout the interstellar medium.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

4BLACKBODY RADIATIONAnyone who has looked at the constellation of Orion on a clear winter night has noticed thestrikingly different colors of red Betelgeuse (in Orion‚Äôs northeast shoulder) and blue-whiteRigel (in the southwest leg); see Fig. 7. These colors betray the difference in the surfacetemperatures of the two stars. Betelgeuse has a surface temperature of roughly 3600 K,signiÔ¨Åcantly cooler than the 13,000-K surface of Rigel.12The Connection between Color and TemperatureThe connection between the color of light emitted by a hot object and its temperature wasÔ¨Årst noticed in 1792 by the English maker of Ô¨Åne porcelain Thomas Wedgewood. All ofhis ovens became red-hot at the same temperature, independent of their size, shape, andconstruction. Subsequent investigations by many physicists revealed that any object witha temperature above absolute zero emits light of all wavelengths with varying degrees ofefÔ¨Åciency; anideal emitteris an object that absorbsallof the light energy incident uponit and reradiates this energy with the characteristic spectrum shown in Fig. 8. Becausean ideal emitter reÔ¨Çects no light, it is known as ablackbody, and the radiation it emitsis calledblackbody radiation. Stars and planets are blackbodies, at least to a rough Ô¨Årstapproximation.Figure 8 shows that a blackbody of temperatureTemits acontinuous spectrumwithsome energy at all wavelengths and that this blackbody spectrum peaks at a wavelengthŒªmax, which becomes shorter with increasing temperature.

Josef Stefan (1835‚Äì1893) in 1879 showed that the luminosity,L, of a blackbody of areaAand temperatureT(in kelvins) is given byL=AœÉT4.(16)Five years later another Austrian physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann (1844‚Äì1906), derived thisequation, now called theStefan‚ÄìBoltzmann equation, using the laws of thermodynamicsand Maxwell‚Äôs formula for radiation pressure. The Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann constant,œÉ, has thevalueœÉ=5.670400√ó10‚àí8Wm‚àí2K‚àí4.For a spherical star of radiusRand surface areaA=4œÄR2, the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann equationtakes the formL=4œÄR2œÉT4e.(17)Since stars are not perfect blackbodies, we use this equation todeÔ¨Ånetheeffective temper-atureTeof a star‚Äôs surface.

However, the Sun emits a continuum of wavelengths both shorter and longerthanŒªmax, and the human eye perceives the Sun‚Äôs color as yellow.

The Eve of a New World ViewThis section draws to a close at the end of the nineteenth century. The physicists andastronomers of the time believed that all of the principles that govern the physical worldhad Ô¨Ånally been discovered. Their scientiÔ¨Åc world view, theNewtonian paradigm, was theculmination of the heroic, golden age of classical physics that had Ô¨Çourished for over threehundred years. The construction of this paradigm began with the brilliant observations ofGalileo and the subtle insights of Newton. Its architecture was framed by Newton‚Äôs laws,supported by the twin pillars of the conservation of energy and momentum and illuminatedby Maxwell‚Äôs electromagnetic waves. Its legacy was a deterministic description of a universethat ran like clockwork, with wheels turning inside of wheels, all of its gears perfectlymeshed. Physics was in danger of becoming a victim of its own success. There were nochallenges remaining. All of the great discoveries apparently had been made, and the onlytask remaining for men and women of science at the end of the nineteenth century wasÔ¨Ålling in the details.However, as the twentieth century opened, it became increasingly apparent that a crisiswas brewing. Physicists were frustrated by their inability to answer some of the simplestquestions concerning light. What is the medium through which light waves travel the vastdistances between the stars, and what is Earth‚Äôs speed through this medium? What deter-mines the continuous spectrum of blackbody radiation and the characteristic, discrete colorsof tubes Ô¨Ålled with hot glowing gases? Astronomers were tantalized by hints of a treasureof knowledge just beyond their grasp.It took a physicist of the stature of Albert Einstein to topple the Newtonian paradigmand bring about two revolutions in physics. One transformed our ideas about space andtime, and the other changed our basic concepts of matter and energy. The rigid clockworkuniverse of the golden era was found to be an illusion and was replaced by a randomuniverse governed by the laws of probability and statistics. The following four lines aptlysummarize the situation. The Ô¨Årst two lines were written by the English poetAlexander Pope(1688‚Äì1744), a contemporary of Newton; the last two, by Sir J. C. Squire (1884‚Äì1958),were penned in 1926.Nature and Nature‚Äôs laws lay hid in night:God said,Let Newton be!and all was light.It did not last: the Devil howling ‚ÄúHo!Let Einstein be!‚Äù restored the status quo.5THE QUANTIZATION OF ENERGYOne of the problems haunting physicists at the end of the nineteenth century was theirinability to derive from fundamental physical principles the blackbody radiation curve de-picted in Fig. 8. Lord Rayleigh14(1842‚Äì1919) had attempted to arrive at the expression byapplying Maxwell‚Äôs equations of classical electromagnetic theory together with the results14Lord Rayleigh, as he is commonly known, was born John William Strutt but succeeded to the title of third BaronRayleigh of Terling Place, Witham, in the county of Essex, when he was thirty years old.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

from thermal physics. His strategy was to consider a cavity of temperatureTÔ¨Ålled withblackbody radiation. This may be thought of as a hot oven Ô¨Ålled with standing waves ofelectromagnetic radiation. IfLis the distance between the oven‚Äôs walls, then the permittedwavelengths of the radiation areŒª=2L,L,2L/3, 2L/4, 2L/5,..., extending forever to in-creasingly shorter wavelengths.15According to classical physics, each of these wavelengthsshould receive an amount of energy equal tokT, wherek=1.3806503√ó10‚àí23JK‚àí1isBoltzmann‚Äôs constant, familiar from the ideal gas lawPV=NkT. The result of Rayleigh‚Äôsderivation gaveBŒª(T )‚âÉ2ckTŒª4,(valid only ifŒªis long)(20)which agrees well with the long-wavelength tail of the blackbody radiation curve. However,a severe problem with Rayleigh‚Äôs result was recognized immediately; his solution forBŒª(T )grows without limit asŒª‚Üí0. The source of the problem is that according to classicalphysics, an inÔ¨Ånite number of inÔ¨Ånitesimally short wavelengths implied that an unlimitedamount of blackbody radiation energy was contained in the oven, a theoretical result soabsurd it was dubbed the ‚Äúultraviolet catastrophe.‚Äù Equation ( 20) is known today as theRayleigh‚ÄìJeans law.16Wien was also working on developing the correct mathematical expression for the black-body radiation curve. Guided by the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law (Eq. 16) and classical thermalphysics, Wien was able to develop an empirical law that described the curve at short wave-lengths but failed at longer wavelengths:BŒª(T )‚âÉaŒª‚àí5e‚àíb/ŒªT,(valid only ifŒªis short)(21)whereaandbwere constants chosen to provide the best Ô¨Åt to the experimental data.Planck‚Äôs Function for the Blackbody Radiation CurveBy late 1900 the German physicist Max Planck (1858‚Äì1947) had discovered that a modi-Ô¨Åcation of Wien‚Äôs expression could be made to Ô¨Åt the blackbody spectra shown in Fig. 8while simultaneously replicating the long-wavelength success of the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans lawand avoiding the ultraviolet catastrophe:BŒª(T )=a/Œª5eb/ŒªT‚àí1,In order to determine the constantsaandbwhile circumventing the ultraviolet catas-trophe, Planck employed a clever mathematical trick. He assumed that a standing electro-magnetic wave of wavelengthŒªand frequencyŒΩ=c/Œªcould not acquire just any arbitraryamount of energy. Instead, the wave could have only speciÔ¨Åc allowed energy values that15This is analogous to standing waves on a string of lengthLthat is held Ô¨Åxed at both ends. The permittedwavelengths are the same as those of the standing electromagnetic waves.16James Jeans (1877‚Äì1946), a British astronomer, found a numerical error in Rayleigh‚Äôs original work; the correctedresult now bears the names of both men.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

were integral multiples of a minimum wave energy.17This minimum energy, aquantumofenergy, is given byhŒΩorhc/Œª, wherehis a constant. Thus the energy of an electromagneticwave isnhŒΩornhc/Œª, wheren(an integer) is the number of quanta in the wave. Given thisassumption of quantized wave energy with a minimum energy proportional to the frequencyof the wave, the entire oven could not contain enough energy to supply even one quantumof energy for the short-wavelength, high-frequency waves. Thus the ultraviolet catastrophewould be avoided. Planck hoped that at the end of his derivation, the constanthcould beset to zero; certainly, an artiÔ¨Åcial constant should not remain in his Ô¨Ånal result forBŒª(T ).Planck‚Äôs stratagem worked! His formula, now known as thePlanck function, agreedwonderfully with experiment, butonlyif the constanthremained in the equation:18BŒª(T )=2hc2/Œª5ehc/ŒªkT‚àí1.(22)Planck‚Äôs constanthas the valueh=6.62606876√ó10‚àí34J s.The Planck Function and AstrophysicsFinally armed with the correct expression for the blackbody spectrum, we can apply Planck‚Äôsfunction to astrophysical systems.

Unfortunately, these units canbe misleading. You should note that ‚ÄúW m‚àí3‚Äù indicates power (energy per unit time) perunit area per unit wavelength interval, W m‚àí2m‚àí1,notenergy per unit time per unitvolume. To help avoid confusion, the units of the wavelength intervaldŒªare sometimesexpressed in nanometers rather than meters, so the units of the Planck function becomeWm‚àí2nm‚àí1sr‚àí1, as in Fig. 8.20At times it is more convenient to deal with frequency intervalsdŒΩthan with wavelengthintervalsdŒª. In this case the Planck function has the formBŒΩ(T )=2hŒΩ3/c2ehŒΩ/kT‚àí1.(24)17Actually, Planck restricted the possible energies of hypothetical electromagnetic oscillators in the oven wallsthat emit the electromagnetic radiation.18It is left for you to show that the Planck function reduces to the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law at long wavelengths(Problem 10) and to Wien‚Äôs expression at short wavelengths (Problem 11).19Note thatdAcosŒ∏is the areadAprojected onto a plane perpendicular to the direction in which the radiation istraveling...20The value of the Planck function thus depends on the units of the wavelength interval.

In Problem 14, you will use Eq. ( 27) to express the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann constant,œÉ,i nterms of the fundamental constantsc,h, andk. The monochromatic luminosity is relatedto themonochromatic Ô¨Çux,FŒªdŒª, by the inverse square law for light, Eq.

Of course, Earth‚Äôs atmosphere absorbs somestarlight, but measurements of Ô¨Çuxes and apparent magnitudes can be corrected to accountforthisabsorptionThevaluesofthesequantitiesusuallyquotedforstarsarein fact corrected values and would be the results of measurements above Earth‚Äôs absorbingatmosphere.6THE COLOR INDEXThe apparent and absolute magnitudes discussed in Section 2, measured over all wave-lengths of light emitted by a star, are known asbolometric magnitudesand are denoted bymbolandMbol, respectively.21In practice, however, detectors measure the radiant Ô¨Çux of astar only within a certain wavelength region deÔ¨Åned by the sensitivity of the detector.UBV Wavelength FiltersThecolorof a star may be precisely determined by using Ô¨Ålters that transmit the star‚Äôs lightonly within certain narrow wavelength bands. In the standardUBVsystem, a star‚Äôs apparentmagnitude is measured through three Ô¨Ålters and is designated by three capital letters:‚Ä¢U, the star‚Äôsultravioletmagnitude, is measured through a Ô¨Ålter centered at 365 nmwith an effective bandwidth of 68 nm.‚Ä¢B, the star‚Äôsbluemagnitude, is measured through a Ô¨Ålter centered at 440 nm with aneffective bandwidth of 98 nm.‚Ä¢V, the star‚Äôsvisualmagnitude, is measured through a Ô¨Ålter centered at 550 nm withan effective bandwidth of 89 nm.Color Indices and the Bolometric CorrectionUsing Eq. ( 6), a star‚Äôs absolute color magnitudesMU,MB, andMVmay be determined ifits distancedis known.22Astar‚ÄôsU‚àíBcolor indexis the difference between its ultraviolet21Abolometeris an instrument that measures the increase in temperature caused by the radiant Ô¨Çux it receives atall wavelengths.22Note that although apparent magnitude is not denoted by a subscripted ‚Äúm‚Äùi nt h eUBVsystem, the absolutemagnitude is denoted by a subscripted ‚ÄúM.‚Äù.The Continuous Spectrum of Light

and blue magnitudes, and a star‚ÄôsB‚àíVcolor index is the difference between its blue andvisual magnitudes:U‚àíB=MU‚àíMBandB‚àíV=MB‚àíMV.Stellar magnitudesdecreasewith increasing brightness; consequently, a star with a smallerB‚àíVcolor index isbluerthan a star with a larger value ofB‚àíV. Because a color indexis the difference between two magnitudes, Eq. ( 6) shows that it is independent of the star‚Äôsdistance. The difference between a star‚Äôs bolometric magnitude and its visual magnitude isitsbolometric correctionBC:BC=mbol‚àíV=Mbol‚àíMV.(30)Example 6.1.Sirius, the brightest-appearing star in the sky, hasU,B, andVapparentmagnitudes ofU=‚àí1.47,B=‚àí1.43, andV=‚àí1.44. Thus for Sirius,U‚àíB=‚àí1.47‚àí(‚àí1.43)=‚àí0.04andB‚àíV=‚àí1.43‚àí(‚àí1.44)=0.01.Sirius is brightest at ultraviolet wavelengths, as expected for a star with an effective tem-perature ofTe=9970 K. For this surface temperature,Œªmax=0.0029 m K9970 K=291 nm,which is in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The bolometric correc-tion for Sirius isBC=‚àí0.09, so its apparent bolometric magnitude ismbol=V+BC=‚àí1.44+(‚àí0.09)=‚àí1.53.The relation between apparent magnitude and radiant Ô¨Çux, Eq. ( 4), can be used toderive expressions for the ultraviolet, blue, and visual magnitudes measured (above Earth‚Äôsatmosphere) for a star. Asensitivity functionS(Œª)is used to describe the fraction of thestar‚Äôs Ô¨Çux that is detected at wavelengthŒª.Sdepends on the reÔ¨Çectivity of the telescopemirrors, the bandwidth of theU,B, andVÔ¨Ålters, and the response of the photometer. Thus,for example, a star‚Äôs ultraviolet magnitudeUis given byU=‚àí2.5 log10/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay‚àû0FŒªSUdŒª/parenrightbigg+CU,(31)whereCUis a constant.

Nevertheless, astronomers have chosen to continue usingthis unphysical method of measuring magnitudes.25It is left as an exercise for you toevaluate the constantCbolby using the value ofmbolassigned to the Sun:mSun=‚àí26.83.The color indicesU‚àíBandB‚àíVare immediately seen to beU‚àíB=‚àí2.5 log10/parenleftbigg/integraltextFŒªSUdŒª/integraltextFŒªSBdŒª/parenrightbigg+CU‚àíB,(33)whereCU‚àíB‚â°CU‚àíCB. A similar relation holds forB‚àíV. From Eq. ( 29), note thatalthough the apparent magnitudes depend on the radiusRof the model star and its distancer, the color indices do not, because the factor of(R/r)2cancels in Eq. ( 33). Thus thecolor index is a measure solely of the temperature of a model blackbody star.Example 6.2.A certain hot star has a surface temperature of 42,000 K and color indicesU‚àíB=‚àí1.19 andB‚àíV=‚àí0.33.

Water waves are disturbancestraveling through water, and sound waves are disturbances traveling through air. JamesClerk Maxwell predicted that light consists of ‚Äúmodulations of the same medium which isthe cause of electric and magnetic phenomena,‚Äù but what was the medium through whichlight waves traveled? At the time, physicists believed that light waves moved through amedium called theluminiferous ether. This idea of an all-pervading ether had its roots inthe science of early Greece. In addition to the four earthly elements of earth, air, Ô¨Åre, andwater, the Greeks believed that the heavens were composed of a Ô¨Åfth perfect element: theether. Maxwell echoed their ancient belief when he wrote:There can be no doubt that the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are notempty, but are occupied by a material substance or body, which is certainly thelargest, and probably the most uniform body of which we have any knowledge.This modern reincarnation of the ether had been proposed for the sole purpose of transportinglight waves; an object moving through the ether would experience no mechanical resistance,so Earth‚Äôs velocity through the ether could not be directly measured.The Galilean TransformationsIn fact,nomechanical experiment is capable of determining the absolute velocity of an ob-server. It is impossible to tell whether you are at rest or in uniform motion (not accelerating).This general principle was recognized very early.

As shown in Fig. 1, the laboratoryconsists of (in principle) an inÔ¨Ånite collection of meter sticks and synchronized clocks thatcan record the position and time of any event that occurs in the laboratory,at the location ofthat event; this removes the time delay involved in relaying information about an event toa distant recording device. With no loss of generality, the frameS‚Ä≤can be taken as movingin the positivex-direction (relative to the frameS) with constant velocityu, as shown inFig. 2.1Furthermore, the clocks in the two frames can be started when the origins of thecoordinate systems,OandO‚Ä≤, coincide at timet=t‚Ä≤=0.Observers in the two framesSandS‚Ä≤measure the same moving object, recording itspositions(x, y, z)and(x‚Ä≤,y‚Ä≤,z‚Ä≤)at timetandt‚Ä≤, respectively. An appeal to common senseand intuition leads to the conclusion that these measurements are related by theGalileantransformation equations:x‚Ä≤=x‚àíut(1)y‚Ä≤=y(2)z‚Ä≤=z(3)t‚Ä≤=t.(4)1This doesnotimply that the frameSis at rest and thatS‚Ä≤is moving.S‚Ä≤could be at rest whileSmoves in thenegativex‚Ä≤-direction, or both frames could be moving.

In 1887 two Americans, the physicistAlbert A. Michelson (1852‚Äì1931) and his chemist colleague Edward W. Morley (1838‚Äì1923), performed a classic experiment that attempted this measurement of Earth‚Äôs absolutevelocity.

ofzero!2Furthermore, as Earth spins on its axis and orbits the Sun, a laboratory‚Äôs speedthrough the ether should be constantly changing. The constantly shifting ‚Äúether wind‚Äùshould easily be detected. However, all of the many physicists who have since repeatedthe Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment with increasing precision have reported the same nullresult. Everyone measuresexactlythe same value for the speed of light, regardless of thevelocity of the laboratory on Earth or the velocity of the source of the light.On the other hand, Eq. ( 5) implies that two observers moving with a relative veloc-ityushould obtaindifferentvalues for the speed of light. The contradiction between thecommonsense expectation of Eq. ( 5) and the experimentally determined constancy ofthe speed of light means that this equation, and the equations from which it was derived(theGalileantransformationequations,1‚Äì 4), cannot be correct. Although the Galileantransformations adequately describe the familiar low-speed world of everyday life wherev/c‚â™1, they are in sharp disagreement with the results of experiments involving velocitiesnear the speed of light. A crisis in the Newtonian paradigm was developing.2THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONSThe young Albert Einstein (1875‚Äì1955; see Fig. 3) enjoyed discussing a puzzle with hisfriends: What would you see if you looked in a mirror while moving at the speed of light?Would you see your image in the mirror, or not? This was the beginning of Einstein‚Äôs searchfor a simple, consistent picture of the universe, a quest that would culminate in his theories

of relativity. After much reÔ¨Çection, Einstein Ô¨Ånally rejected the notion of an all-pervadingether.Einstein‚Äôs PostulatesIn 1905 Einstein introduced his two postulates of special relativity3in a remarkable paper,‚ÄúOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.‚ÄùThe phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no prop-erties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that ‚Ä¶the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames ofreference for which the equations of mechanics hold good. We will raise thisconjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the ‚ÄúPrinciple of Rela-tivity‚Äù) to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, whichis only apparently irreconcilable to the former, namely, that light is alwayspropagated in empty space with a deÔ¨Ånite speedcwhich is independent of thestate of motion of the emitting body.In other words,Einstein‚Äôs postulatesareThe Principle of RelativityThe laws of physics are the same in all inertialreference frames.The Constancy of the Speed of LightLight moves through a vacuum at aconstant speedcthat is independent of the motion of the light source.The Derivation of the Lorentz TransformationsEinstein then went on to derive the equations that lie at the heart of his theory of specialrelativity, theLorentz transformations.4For the two inertial reference frames shown inFig. 2, the most general set of linear transformation equations between the space and timecoordinates(x, y, z, t)and(x‚Ä≤,y‚Ä≤,z‚Ä≤,t‚Ä≤)of thesame eventmeasured fromSandS‚Ä≤arex‚Ä≤=a11x+a12y+a13z+a14t(6)y‚Ä≤=a21x+a22y+a23z+a24t(7)z‚Ä≤=a31x+a32y+a33z+a34t(8)t‚Ä≤=a41x+a42y+a43z+a44t.(9)If the transformation equations were not linear, then the length of a moving object or thetime interval between two events would depend on the choice of origin for the framesSandS‚Ä≤. This is unacceptable, since the laws of physics cannot depend on the numericalcoordinates of an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system.3The theory ofspecialrelativity deals only with inertial reference frames, whereas thegeneraltheory includesaccelerating frames.4These equations were Ô¨Årst derived by Hendrik A. Lorentz (1853‚Äì1928) of the Netherlands but were applied to adifferent situation involving a reference frame at absolute rest with respect to the ether.The Theory of Special Relativity

Einstein‚Äôs Ô¨Årst postulate, the Principle of Relativity, impliesthat lengthsperpendiculartou, the velocity of frameSrelative toS‚Ä≤, are unchanged. Tosee this, imagine that each frame has a meter stick oriented along they- andy‚Ä≤-axes, withone end of each meter stick located at the origin of its respective frame; see Fig. 4. Paintbrushes are mounted perpendicular at both ends of each meter stick, and the frames areseparated by a sheet of glass that extends to inÔ¨Ånity in thex‚Äìyplane. Each brush paints aline on the glass sheet as the two frames pass each other. Let‚Äôs say that frameSuses bluepaint, and frameS‚Ä≤uses red paint. If an observer in frameSmeasures the meter stick inframeS‚Ä≤to be shorter than his own meter stick, he will see the red lines paintedinsidehisblue lines on the glass. But by the Principle of Relativity, an observer in frameS‚Ä≤wouldmeasure the meter stick in frameSas being shorter than her own meter stick and wouldsee the blue lines paintedinsideher red lines. Both color lines cannot lie inside the other;the only conclusion is that blue and red lines must overlap. The lengths of the meter sticks,perpendicular tou, are unchanged. Thusy‚Ä≤=yandz‚Ä≤=z, so thata22=a33=1, whereasa21,a23,a24,a31,a32, anda34are all zero.Another simpliÔ¨Åcation comes from requiring that Eq. ( 9) give the same result ifyisreplaced by‚àíyorzis replaced by‚àíz. This must be true because rotational symmetry aboutthe axis parallel to the relative velocityuimplies that a time measurement cannot dependon the side of thex-axis on which an event occurs.

However, only one of Einstein‚Äôspostulates has been employed in the derivation thus far: the Principle of Relativity cham-pioned by Galileo himself.Now the argument introduces the second of Einstein‚Äôs postulates: Everyone measuresexactly the same value for the speed of light. Suppose that when the originsOandO‚Ä≤coincide at timet=t‚Ä≤=0, a Ô¨Çashbulb is set off at the common origins.

Four-Dimensional SpacetimeThe Lorentz transformation equations form the core of the theory of special relativity, andthey have many surprising and unusual implications. The most obvious surprise is theintertwining roles of spatial and temporal coordinates in the transformations. In the wordsof Einstein‚Äôs professor, Hermann Minkowski (1864‚Äì1909), ‚ÄúHenceforth space by itself,and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of unionbetween the two will preserve an independent reality.‚Äù The drama of the physical worldunfolds on the stage of a four-dimensionalspacetime, where events are identiÔ¨Åed by theirspacetime coordinates(x, y, z, t).3TIME AND SPACE IN SPECIAL RELATIVITYSuppose an observer in frameSmeasures two Ô¨Çashbulbs going off at thesame timetbutatdifferentx-coordinatesx1andx2. Then an observer in frameS‚Ä≤would measure the timeintervalt‚Ä≤1‚àít‚Ä≤2between the Ô¨Çashbulbs going off to be (see Eq. 9)t‚Ä≤1‚àít‚Ä≤2=(x2‚àíx1) u/c2/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2.(25)According to the observer in frameS‚Ä≤,i fx1Ã∏=x2, then the Ô¨Çashbulbs do not go off at thesame time!Events that occur simultaneously in one inertial reference frame do not occursimultaneously in all other inertial reference frames. There is no such thing as two eventsthat occur at different locations happeningabsolutelyat the same time. Equation ( 25)shows that ifx1<x2, thent‚Ä≤1‚àít‚Ä≤2>0 for positiveu; Ô¨Çashbulb 1 is measured to go offafterÔ¨Çashbulb 2. An observer moving at the same speed in the opposite direction (uchangedto‚àíu) will come to the opposite conclusion: Flashbulb 2 goes offafterÔ¨Çashbulb 1. Thesituation is symmetric; an observer in frameS‚Ä≤will conclude that the Ô¨Çashbulb he or shepasses Ô¨Årst goes offafterthe other Ô¨Çashbulb. It is tempting to ask, ‚ÄúWhich observer isreallycorrect?‚Äù However, this question is meaningless and is equivalent to asking, ‚ÄúWhichobserver isreallymoving?‚Äù Neither question has an answer because ‚Äúreally‚Äù has no meaningin this situation. There is no absolute simultaneity, just as there is no absolute motion. Eachobserver‚Äôs measurement is correct, as made from his or her own frame of reference.The implications of thisdownfall of universal simultaneityare far-reaching. The ab-sence of a universal simultaneity means that clocks in relative motion will not stay syn-chronized. Newton‚Äôs idea of an absolute universal time that ‚Äúof itself and from its ownnature Ô¨Çows equably without regard to anything external‚Äù has been overthrown. Differentobservers in relative motion will measuredifferenttime intervals between thesametwoevents!Proper Time and Time DilationImagine that a strobe light located at rest relative to frameS‚Ä≤produces a Ô¨Çash of light every/Delta1t‚Ä≤seconds; see Fig. 6. If one Ô¨Çash is emitted at timet‚Ä≤1, then the next Ô¨Çash will be emittedat timet‚Ä≤2=t‚Ä≤1+/Delta1t‚Ä≤, as measured by a clock in frameS‚Ä≤. Using Eq.

( 26) becomes/Delta1tmoving=/Delta1trest/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2.(27)This equation shows the effect oftime dilationon a moving clock. It says that thetime interval between two events is measured differently by different observers in relativemotion. Theshortest time intervalis measured by a clockat restrelative to the two events.This clock measures theproper timebetween the two events. Any other clock movingrelative to the two events will measure a longer time interval between them.The effect of time dilation is often described by the phrase ‚Äúmoving clocks run slower‚Äùwithout explicitly identifying the two events involved. This easily leads to confusion, sincethe moving and rest subscripts in Eq. ( 27) mean ‚Äúmoving‚Äù or ‚Äúat rest‚Äùrelative to the twoevents. To gain insight into this phrase, imagine that you are holding clockCwhile it ticksonce each second and, at the same time, are measuring the ticks of an identical clockC‚Ä≤moving relative to you. The two events to be measured are consecutive ticks of clockC‚Ä≤.Since clockC‚Ä≤is at rest relative to itself, it measures a time/Delta1trest=1 s between its ownThe Theory of Special Relativity

ticks. However, using your clockC, you measure a time/Delta1tmoving=/Delta1trest/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2=1s/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2>1sbetween the ticks of clockC‚Ä≤. Because you measure clockC‚Ä≤to be ticking slower than onceper second, you conclude that clockC‚Ä≤, which is moving relative to you, is running moreslowly than your clockC. Very accurate atomic clocks have been Ô¨Çown around the worldon jet airliners and have conÔ¨Årmed that moving clocks do indeed run slower, in agreementwith relativity.5Proper Length and Length ContractionBoth time dilation and the downfall of simultaneity contradict Newton‚Äôs belief in absolutetime. Instead, the time measured between two events differs for different observers inrelative motion. Newton also believed that ‚Äúabsolute space, in its own nature, withoutrelation to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.‚Äù However, the Lorentztransformation equations require that different observers in relative motion will measurespace differently as well.Imagine that a rod lies along thex‚Ä≤-axis of frameS‚Ä≤, at rest relative to that frame;S‚Ä≤isthe rod‚Äôs rest frame (see Fig. 7). Let the left end of the rod have coordinatex‚Ä≤1, and let theright end of the rod have coordinatex‚Ä≤2. Then the length of the rod as measured in frameS‚Ä≤isL‚Ä≤=x‚Ä≤2‚àíx‚Ä≤1. What is the length of the rod measured fromS? Because the rod is movingrelative toS, care must be taken to measure thex-coordinatesx1andx2of the ends ofthe rodat the same time. Then Eq.

orL‚Ä≤=L/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2.(28)Because the rod isat restrelative toS‚Ä≤,L‚Ä≤will be calledLrest. Similarly, because the rod ismovingrelative toS,Lwill be calledLmoving. Thus Eq. ( 28) becomesLmoving=Lrest/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2.(29)This equation shows the effect oflength contractionon a moving rod. It says that lengthor distance is measured differently by two observers in relative motion. If a rod is movingrelative to an observer, that observer will measure a shorter rod than will an observer atrest relative to it. Thelongest length, called the rod‚Äôsproper length, is measured in therod‚Äôs rest frame. Only lengths or distancesparallelto the direction of the relative motionare affected by length contraction; distances perpendicular to the direction of the relativemotion are unchanged (cf. Eqs. 17‚Äì 18).Time Dilation and Length Contraction Are ComplementaryTime dilation and length contraction are not independent effects of Einstien‚Äôs new way oflooking at the universe. Rather, they are complementary; the magnitude of either effectdepends on the motion of the event being observed relative to the observer.Example 3.1.Cosmic rays from space collide with the nuclei of atoms in Earth‚Äôs upperatmosphere, producing elementary particles calledmuons. Muons are unstable and decayafter an average lifetimeœÑ=2.20¬µs, as measured in a laboratory where the muons are atrest. That is, the number of muons in a given sample should decrease with time accordingtoN(t)=N0e‚àít/œÑ, whereN0is the number of muons originally in the sample at timet=0. At the top of Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, a detector counted 563 muons hr‚àí1moving downward at a speedu=0.9952c. At sea level, 1907 m below the Ô¨Årst detector,another detector counted 408 muons hr‚àí1.6The muons take(1907 m)/(0.9952c)=6.39¬µs to travel from the top of Mt. Washingtonto sea level. Thus it might be expected that the number of muons detected per hour at sealevel would have beenN=N0e‚àít/œÑ=(563 muons hr‚àí1)e‚àí(6.39¬µs)/(2.20¬µs)=31 muons hr‚àí1.This is much less than the 408 muons hr‚àí1actually measured at sea level! How did themuons live long enough to reach the lower detector? The problem with the precedingcalculation is that the lifetime of 2.20¬µs is measured in the muon‚Äôs rest frame as/Delta1trest, butthe experimenter‚Äôs clocks on Mt.

Repeatingthe preceding calculation using the muon lifetime as measured by the experimenters givesN=N0e‚àít/œÑ=(563 muons hr‚àí1)e‚àí(6.39¬µs)/(22.5¬µs)=424 muons hr‚àí1.When the effects of time dilation are included, the theoretical prediction is in excellentagreement with the experimental result.From a muon‚Äôs rest frame, its lifetime is only 2.20¬µs. How would an observer ridingalong with the muons, as shown in Fig. 8, explain their ability to reach sea level? Theobserver would measure a severely length-contracted Mt. Washington (in the direction ofthe relative motion only). The distance traveled by the muons would not beLrest=1907 mbut, rather, would beLmoving=Lrest/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2=(1907 m)/radicalbig1‚àí(0.9952)2=186.6m.Thus it would take(186.6m)/(0.9952c)=0.625¬µs for the muons to travel the length-contracted distance to the detector at sea level, as measured by an observer in the muons‚Äôrest frame. That observer would then calculate the number of muons reaching the lowerdetector to beN=N0e‚àít/œÑ=(563 muons hr‚àí1)e‚àí(0.625¬µs)/(2.20¬µs)=424 muons hr‚àí1,in agreement with the previous result. This shows that an effect due to time dilation asmeasured in one frame may instead be attributed to length contraction as measured inanother frame.The Theory of Special Relativity

The effects of time dilation and length contraction are both symmetric between twoobservers in relative motion. Imagine two identical spaceships that move in opposite direc-tions, passing each other at some relativistic speed. Observers aboard each spaceship willmeasure the other ship‚Äôs length as being shorter than their own, and the other ship‚Äôs clocksas running slower.Both observers are right, having made correct measurements from theirrespective frames of reference.You should not think of these effects as being due to some sort of ‚Äúoptical illusion‚Äù causedby light taking different amounts of time to reach an observer from different parts of a movingobject. The language used in the preceding discussions has involved themeasurementofan event‚Äôs spacetime coordinates(x, y, z, t)using meter sticks and clocks locatedat thatevent, so there is no time delay. Of course, no actual laboratory has an inÔ¨Ånite collectionof meter sticks and clocks, and the time delays caused by Ô¨Ånite light-travel times must betaken into consideration. This will be important in determining the relativistic Doppler shiftformula, which follows.The Relativistic Doppler ShiftIn 1842 the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler showed that as a source of sound movesthrough a medium (such as air), the wavelength is compressed in the forward direction andexpanded in the backward direction. This change in wavelength of any type of wave causedby the motion of the source or the observer is called aDoppler shift. Doppler deduced thatthe difference between the wavelengthŒªobsobserved for a moving source of sound and thewavelengthŒªrestmeasured in the laboratory for a reference source at rest is related to theradial velocityvr(the component of the velocity directly toward or away from the observerof the source through the medium byŒªobs‚àíŒªrestŒªrest=/Delta1ŒªŒªrest=vrvs,(30)wherevsis the speed of sound in the medium. However, this expression cannot be pre-cisely correct for light. Experimental results such as those of Michelson and Morley ledEinstein to abandon the ether concept, and they demonstrated that no medium is involvedin the propagation of light waves. The Doppler shift for light is a qualitatively differentphenomenon from its counterpart for sound waves.Consider a distant source of light that emits a light signal at timetrest,1and another signalat timetrest,2=trest,1+/Delta1trestas measured by a clockat restrelative to the source. If thislight source is moving relative to an observer with velocityu, as shown in Fig. 9, then thetime between receiving the light signals at the observer‚Äôs location will depend on both theeffect of time dilation and the different distances traveled by the signals from the source tothe observer. (The light source is assumed to be sufÔ¨Åciently far away that the signals travelalong parallel paths to the observer.) Using Eq. ( 27), we Ô¨Ånd that the time between theemission of the light signals as measured in the observer‚Äôs frame is/Delta1trest/slashbig/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2.I nthis time, the observer determines that the distance to the light source has changed by anamountu/Delta1trestcosŒ∏/slashbig/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c2.

The equation describing therelativistic Doppler shiftis thusŒΩobs=ŒΩrest/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c21+(u/c)cosŒ∏=ŒΩrest/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c21+vr/c,(32)wherevr=ucosŒ∏is theradial velocityof the light source. If the light source is movingdirectly away from the observer (Œ∏=0‚ó¶,vr=u) or toward the observer (Œ∏=180‚ó¶,vr=‚àíu), then the relativistic Doppler shift reduces toŒΩobs=ŒΩrest/radicalBigg1‚àívr/c1+vr/c(radial motion).(33)There is also atransverse Doppler shiftfor motion perpendicular to the observer‚Äôs line ofsight (Œ∏=90‚ó¶,vr=0). This transverse shift is entirely due to the effect of time dilation.Note that, unlike formulas describing the Doppler shift for sound, Eqs. ( 32) and ( 33)do not distinguish between the velocity of the source and the velocity of the observer. Onlythe relative velocity is important.When astronomers observe a star or galaxy moving away from or toward Earth, the wave-length of the light they receive is shifted toward longer or shorter wavelengths, respectively.If the source of light is movingawayfrom the observer (vr>0), thenŒªobs>Œªrest. Thisshift to a longer wavelength is called aredshift. Similarly, if the source is movingtowardthe observer (vr<0), then there is a shift to a shorter wavelength, ablueshift.7Because7Doppler himself maintained that all stars would be white if they were at rest and that the different colors ofthe stars were due to their Doppler shifts. However, the stars move much too slowly for their Doppler shifts tosigniÔ¨Åcantly change their colors.The Theory of Special Relativity

most of the objects in the universe outside of our own Milky Way Galaxy are moving awayfrom us, redshifts are commonly measured by astronomers. Aredshift parameterzis usedto describe the change in wavelength; it is deÔ¨Åned asz‚â°Œªobs‚àíŒªrestŒªrest=/Delta1ŒªŒªrest.(34)The observed wavelengthŒªobsis obtained from Eq.

(34), together withŒª=c/ŒΩ, shows thatz+1=/Delta1tobs/Delta1trest.(37)This expression indicates that if the luminosity of an astrophysical source with redshiftparameterz>0 (receding) is observed to vary during a time/Delta1tobs, then the change inluminosity occurred over ashortertime/Delta1trest=/Delta1tobs/(z+1)in the rest frame of thesource.Example 3.2.In its rest frame, the quasar SDSS 1030+0524 produces a hydrogen emis-sion line of wavelengthŒªrest=121.6 nm. On Earth, this emission line is observed to havea wavelength ofŒªobs=885.2 nm. The redshift parameter for this quasar is thusz=Œªobs‚àíŒªrestŒªrest=6.28.Using Eq.

Quasar SDSS 1030+0524 appears to be moving away from us at more than 96% of the speedof light! However, objects that are enormously distant from us, such as quasars, have largeapparent recessional speeds due to the overall expansion of the universe. In these cases theincrease in the observed wavelength is actually due tothe expansion of space itself(whichstretches the wavelength of light) rather than being due to the motion of the object throughspace! Thiscosmological redshiftis a consequence of the Big Bang.This quasar was discovered as a product of the massive Sloan Digital Sky Survey; seeBecker, et al. (2001) for further information about this object.Suppose the speeduof the light source is small compared to that of light (u/c‚â™1).Using the expansion (to Ô¨Årst order)(1+vr/c)¬±1/2‚âÉ1¬±vr2c,together with Eqs. (34) and (35) for radial motion, then shows that for low speeds,z=/Delta1ŒªŒªrest‚âÉvrc,(39)wherevr>0 for a receding source (/Delta1Œª >0) andvr<0 for an approaching source (/Delta1Œª <0). Although this equation is similar to Eq. ( 30), you should bear in mind that Eq. ( 39)is anapproximation, valid only for low speeds. Misapplying this equation to the relativisticquasar SDSS 1030+0524 discussed in Example 3.2 would lead to the erroneous conclusionthat the quasar is moving away from us at 6.28 times the speed of light!The Relativistic Velocity TransformationBecause space and time intervals are measured differently by different observers in relativemotion, velocities must be transformed as well. The equations describing the relativistictransformation of velocities may be easily found from the Lorentz transformation equations( 16‚Äì 19) by writing them as differentials. Then dividing thedx‚Ä≤,dy‚Ä≤, anddz‚Ä≤equationsby thedt‚Ä≤equation gives therelativistic velocity transformations:v‚Ä≤x=vx‚àíu1‚àíuvx/c2v‚Ä≤y=vy/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c21‚àíuvx/c2v‚Ä≤z=vz/radicalbig1‚àíu2/c21‚àíuvx/c2.(40)(41)(42)As with the inverse Lorentz transformations, the inverse velocity transformations may beobtained by switching primed and unprimed quantities and by replacinguwith‚àíu. It is leftas an exercise to show that these equations do satisfy the second of Einstein‚Äôs postulates:Light travels through a vacuum at a constant speed that is independent of the motion of thelight source.

Example 3.3.As measured in the reference frameS‚Ä≤, a light source is at rest and radiateslight equally in all directions. In particular, half of the light is emitted into the forward(positivex‚Ä≤) hemisphere. Is this situation any different when viewed from frameS, whichmeasures the light source traveling in the positivex-direction with a relativistic speedu?Consider a light ray whose velocity components measured inS‚Ä≤arev‚Ä≤x=0,v‚Ä≤y=c, andv‚Ä≤z=0. This ray travels along the boundary between the forward and backward hemispheresof light as measured inS‚Ä≤. However, as measured in frameS, this light ray has the velocitycomponents given by the inverse transformations of Eqs.

whereŒ≥is the Lorentz factor deÔ¨Åned by Eq. ( 20). For relativistic speedsu‚âàc, implyingthatŒ≥is very large, so sinŒ∏(and henceŒ∏) becomes very small.All of the light emitted into theforward hemisphere, as measured inS‚Ä≤, is concentrated into a narrow cone in the directionof the light source‚Äôs motion when measured in frameS. Called theheadlight effect, thisresult plays an important role in many areas of astrophysics. For example, as relativisticelectrons spiral around magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines, they emit light in the form ofsynchrotronradiation. The radiation is concentrated in the direction of the electron‚Äôs motion and isstrongly plane-polarized. Synchrotron radiation is an important electromagnetic radiationprocess in the Sun, Jupiter‚Äôs magnetosphere, pulsars, and active galaxies.4RELATIVISTIC MOMENTUM AND ENERGYUp to this point, only relativistic kinematics has been considered. Einstein‚Äôs theory ofspecial relativity also requires new deÔ¨Ånitions for the concepts of momentum and energy.The ideas of conservation of linear momentum and energy are two of the cornerstones ofphysics. According to the Principle of Relativity, if momentum is conserved in one inertialframe of reference, then it must be conserved in all inertial frames. At the end of thissection, it is shown that this requirement leads to a deÔ¨Ånition of therelativistic momentumvector p:p=mv/radicalbig1‚àív2/c2=Œ≥mv,(44)whereŒ≥is the Lorentz factor deÔ¨Åned by Eq.

Thereis no compelling reason for this separation, and it can be misleading. In this text, the massmof a particle is taken to be the same value inallinertial reference frames; it isinvariantunder a Lorentz transformation, and so there is no reason to qualify the term as a ‚Äúrest mass.‚ÄùThus the mass of a moving particledoes notincrease with increasing speed, although itsmomentumapproaches inÔ¨Ånity asv‚Üíc. Also note that the ‚Äúv‚Äù in the denominator is themagnitude of the particle‚Äôs velocity relative to the observer,notthe relative velocityubetween two arbitrary frames of reference.The Derivation ofE=mc2Using Eq.

(45) is to be correct. The proofs will be left as exercises.The right-hand side of this expression for the kinetic energy consists of the differencebetween two energy terms. The Ô¨Årst is identiÔ¨Åed as thetotal relativistic energyE,E=mc2/radicalbig1‚àív2/c2=Œ≥ mc2.(46)The second term is an energy that does not depend on the speed of the particle; the particlehas this energy even when it is at rest. The termmc2is called therest energyof the particle:Erest=mc2.(47)The particle‚Äôs kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy. When the energy of aparticle is given as (for example) 40 MeV , the implicit meaning is that the particle‚Äôskineticenergyis 40 MeV; the rest energy is not included. Finally, there is a very useful expressionrelating a particle‚Äôs total energyE, the magnitude of its momentump, and its rest energymc2.

Similarly, the vector momentumpsysof the system is the sum of the momentapiof the individual particles:psys=/summationtextni=1pi.I fthe momentum of the system of particles is conserved, then the total energy is also conserved,even for inelastic collisionsin which the kinetic energy of the system,Ksys=/summationtextni=1Ki,i sreduced. The kinetic energy lost in the inelastic collisions goes into increasing the restenergy, and hence the mass, of the particles. This increase in rest energy allows the totalenergy of the system to be conserved. Mass and energy are two sides of the same coin; onecan be transformed into the other.Example 4.1.In a one-dimensional completely inelastic collision, two identical parti-cles of massmand speedvapproach each other, collide head-on, and merge to form a singleparticle of massM.

Thus after the collision,the particle is at rest and its Ô¨Ånal energy isEsys,f=Mc2.Equating the initial and Ô¨Ånal energies of the system shows that the massMof the conglom-erate particle isM=2m/radicalbig1‚àív2/c2.Thus the particle mass has increased by an amount/Delta1m=M‚àí2m=2m/radicalbig1‚àív2/c2‚àí2m=2m/parenleftBigg1/radicalbig1‚àív2/c2‚àí1/parenrightBigg.The origin of this mass increase may be found by comparing the initial and Ô¨Ånal values ofthe kinetic energy.

The Derivation of Relativistic Momentum (Eq. 44)To justify Eq. ( 44) for the relativistic momentum, we will consider a glancing elasticcollision between two identical particles of massm. This collision will be observed fromthree carefully chosen inertial reference frames, as shown in Fig. 11. When measured inan inertial reference frameS‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, the two particlesAandBhave velocities and momenta thatare equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, both before and after the collision. As aresult, the total momentum must be zero both before and after the collision; momentumis conserved. This collision can also be measured from two other reference frames,SandS‚Ä≤. From Fig. 11, ifSmoves in the negativex‚Ä≤‚Ä≤-direction with a velocity equal to thex‚Ä≤‚Ä≤-component of particleAinS‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, then as measured from frameS, the velocity of particleAhas only ay-component. Similarly, ifS‚Ä≤moves in the positivex‚Ä≤‚Ä≤-direction with a velocityequal to thex‚Ä≤‚Ä≤-component of particleBinS‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, then as measured from frameS‚Ä≤, the velocityof particleBhas only ay-component. Actually, the Ô¨Ågures for framesSandS‚Ä≤would beidenticalif the Ô¨Ågures for one of these frames were rotated by 180‚ó¶and theAandBlabelswere reversed.

So far, the argument has been independent of a speciÔ¨Åc formula for the relativisticmomentum vectorp. Let‚Äôs assume that the relativistic momentum vector has the formp=fmv, wherefis a relativistic factor that depends on themagnitudeof the particle‚Äôsvelocity, but not its direction. As the particle‚Äôs speedv‚Üí0, it is required that the factorf‚Üí1 to obtain agreement with the Newtonian result.9A second assumption allows the relativistic factorfto be determined: They- andy‚Ä≤-components of each particle‚Äôs velocity are chosen to be arbitrarily small compared to thespeed of light. Thus they- andy‚Ä≤-components of particleA‚Äôs velocity in framesSandS‚Ä≤are extremely small, and thex‚Ä≤-component of particleA‚Äôs velocity in frameS‚Ä≤is taken tobe relativistic. Sincev‚Ä≤A=/radicalBigv‚Ä≤2A,x+v‚Ä≤2A,y‚âàcin frameS‚Ä≤, the relativistic factorf‚Ä≤for particleAin frameS‚Ä≤is not equal to 1, whereasin frameS,fis arbitrarily close to unity. IfvA,yis the Ô¨Ånaly-component of particleA‚Äôsvelocity, and similarly forv‚Ä≤A,y, then Eq. (49) becomes2f‚Ä≤mv‚Ä≤A,y=2mvA,y.(50)The relative velocityuof framesSandS‚Ä≤is needed to relatev‚Ä≤A,yandvA,yusing Eq. ( 41).BecausevA,x=0 in frameS, Eq. ( 40) shows thatu=‚àív‚Ä≤A,x; that is, the relative velocityuof frameS‚Ä≤relative to frameSis just the negative of thex‚Ä≤-component of particleA‚Äôsvelocity in frameS‚Ä≤. Furthermore, because they‚Ä≤-component of particleA‚Äôs velocity isarbitrarily small, we can setv‚Ä≤A,x=v‚Ä≤A, the magnitude of particleA‚Äôs velocity as measuredin frameS‚Ä≤, and so useu=‚àív‚Ä≤A. Inserting this into Eq. ( 41) withvA,x=0 givesv‚Ä≤A,y=vA,y/radicalBig1‚àív‚Ä≤2A/c2.Finally, inserting this relation betweenv‚Ä≤A,yandvA,yinto Eq.

The Interaction of Lightand Matter1Spectral Lines2Photons3The Bohr Model of the Atom4Quantum Mechanics and Wave‚ÄìParticle Duality1SPECTRAL LINESIn 1835 a French philosopher, Auguste Comte (1798‚Äì1857), considered the limits of humanknowledge. In his bookPositive Philosophy, Comte wrote of the stars, ‚ÄúWe see how wemay determine their forms, their distances, their bulk, their motions, but we can never knowanything of their chemical or mineralogical structure.‚Äù Thirty-three years earlier, however,William Wollaston (1766‚Äì1828), like Newton before him, passed sunlight through a prismto produce a rainbow-like spectrum. He discovered that a number of darkspectral lineswere superimposed on the continuous spectrum where the Sun‚Äôs light had been absorbedat certain discrete wavelengths. By 1814, the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer(1787‚Äì1826) had cataloged 475 of these dark lines (today calledFraunhofer lines)i nt h esolar spectrum. While measuring the wavelengths of these lines, Fraunhofer made the Ô¨Årstobservation capable of proving Comte wrong. Fraunhofer determined that the wavelengthof one prominent dark line in the Sun‚Äôs spectrum corresponds to the wavelength of theyellow light emitted when salt is sprinkled in a Ô¨Çame. The new science ofspectroscopywasborn with the identiÔ¨Åcation of this sodium line.Kirchhoff‚Äôs LawsThe foundations of spectroscopy were established by Robert Bunsen (1811‚Äì1899), a Ger-man chemist, and by Gustav Kirchhoff (1824‚Äì1887), a Prussian theoretical physicist. Bun-sen‚Äôs burner produced a colorless Ô¨Çame that was ideal for studying the spectra of heatedsubstances. He and Kirchhoff then designed aspectroscopethat passed the light of a Ô¨Çamespectrum through a prism to be analyzed. The wavelengths of light absorbed and emittedby an element were found to be the same; Kirchhoff determined that 70 dark lines in thesolar spectrum correspond to 70 bright lines emitted by iron vapor. In 1860 Kirchhoff andBunsen published their classic workChemical Analysis by Spectral Observations, in whichthey developed the idea that every element produces its own pattern of spectral lines andthus may be identiÔ¨Åed by its unique spectral line ‚ÄúÔ¨Ångerprint.‚Äù Kirchhoff summarized theproduction of spectral lines in three laws, which are now known asKirchhoff‚Äôs laws:From Chapter  of An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics,Second Edition, Bradley W.

‚Ä¢ A hot, dense gas or hot solid object produces a continuous spectrum with no darkspectral lines.1‚Ä¢ A hot, diffuse gas produces bright spectral lines (emission lines).‚Ä¢ Acool, diffuse gas in front of a source of a continuous spectrum produces dark spectrallines (absorption lines) in the continuous spectrum.Applications of Stellar Spectra DataAn immediate application of these results was the identiÔ¨Åcation of elements found in theSun and other stars. A new element previously unknown on Earth,helium,2was discoveredspectroscopically on the Sun in 1868; it was not found on Earth until 1895. Figure 1shows the visible portion of the solar spectrum, and Table 1 lists some of the elementsresponsible for producing the dark absorptionequation lines.Another rich line of investigation was pursued by measuring the Doppler shifts of spectrallines.

A diffraction grating is a piece of glass onto whichnarrow, closely spaced lines have been evenly ruled (typically several thousand lines permillimeter); the grating may be made to transmit the light (atransmission grating) or reÔ¨Çectthe light (areÔ¨Çection grating). In either case, the grating acts like a long series of neighboringdouble slits.

Astronomers recognized the great potential for uncovering the secrets of the stars in theempirical rules that had been obtained for the spectrum of light: Wien‚Äôs law, the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann equation, Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws, and the new science of spectroscopy. By 1880Gustav Wiedemann (1826‚Äì1899) found that a detailed investigation of the Fraunhofer linescould reveal the temperature, pressure, and density of the layer of the Sun‚Äôs atmospherethat produces the lines. The splitting of spectral lines by a magnetic Ô¨Åeld was discovered byPieter Zeeman (1865‚Äì1943) of the Netherlands in 1897, raising the possibility of measuringstellar magnetic Ô¨Åelds. But a serious problem blocked further progress: However impressive,these results lacked the solid theoretical foundation required for the interpretation of stellarspectra. For example, the absorption lines produced by hydrogen are much stronger forVega than for the Sun. Does this mean that Vega‚Äôs composition contains signiÔ¨Åcantly morehydrogen than the Sun‚Äôs? The answer is no, but how can this information be gleaned fromthe dark absorption lines of a stellar spectrum recorded on a photographic plate? The answerrequired a new understanding of the nature of light itself.2PHOTONSDespite Heinrich Hertz‚Äôs absolute certainty in the wave nature of light, the solution to theriddle of the continuous spectrum of blackbody radiation led to a complementary descrip-tion, and ultimately to new conceptions of matter and energy. Planck‚Äôs constanthisthebasisofthemoderndescriptionofmatterandenergyknownasquantummechanics. Todayhis recognized as a fundamental constant of nature, like the speed oflightcand the universal gravitational constantG. Although Planck himself was uncom-fortable with the implications of his discovery of energy quantization, quantum theory wasto develop into what is today a spectacularly successful description of the physical world.The next step forward was taken by Einstein, who convincingly demonstrated the realityof Planck‚Äôs quantum bundles of energy.The Photoelectric EffectWhen light shines on a metal surface, electrons are ejected from the surface, a result called thephotoelectric effect. The electrons are emitted with a range of energies, but those originatingclosest to the surface have the maximum kinetic energy,Kmax. A surprising feature of thephotoelectric effect is that the value ofKmaxdoesnotdepend on the brightness of the lightshining on the metal. Increasing the intensity of a monochromatic light source will ejectmoreelectrons but will not increase their maximum kinetic energy. Instead,Kmaxvaries with thefrequencyof the light illuminating the metal surface. In fact, each metal has a characteristiccutoff frequencyŒΩcand a correspondingcutoff wavelengthŒªc=c/ŒΩc; electrons will beemitted only if the frequencyŒΩof the light satisÔ¨ÅesŒΩ>ŒΩc(or the wavelength satisÔ¨ÅesŒª<Œªc). This puzzling frequency dependence is nowhere to be found in Maxwell‚Äôs classicdescriptionofelectromagneticwaves.The equationforthePoyntingvectoradmits no  rolefor the frequency in describing the energy carried by a light wave.Einstein‚Äôs bold solution was to take seriously Planck‚Äôs assumption of the quantizedenergy of electromagnetic waves.

For a single photon of blue light withŒª=400 nm,Ephoton=hcŒª‚âÉ1240 eV nm400 nm=3.10 eV.How many visible photons (Œª=500 nm) are emitted each second by a 100-W light bulb(assuming that it is monochromatic)? The energy of each photon isEphoton=hcŒª‚âÉ1240 eV nm500 nm=2.48 eV=3.97√ó10‚àí19J.This means that the 100-W light bulb emits 2.52√ó1020photons per second. As this hugenumber illustrates, with so many photons nature does not appear ‚Äúgrainy.‚Äù We see the worldas a continuum of light, illuminated by a Ô¨Çood of photons.Einstein reasoned that when a photon strikes the metal surface in the photoelectric effect,its energy may be absorbed by a single electron. The electron uses the photon‚Äôs energy toovercome the binding energy of the metal and so escape from the surface. If theminimumbinding energy of electrons in a metal (called thework functionof the metal, usually a feweV) isœÜ, then the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons isKmax=Ephoton‚àíœÜ=hŒΩ‚àíœÜ=hcŒª‚àíœÜ.(4)SettingKmax=0, the cutoff frequency and wavelength for a metal are seen to beŒΩc=œÜ/handŒªc=hc/œÜ, respectively.The photoelectric effect established the reality of Planck‚Äôs quanta.

Compton measured the change in the wavelength of X-ray photons as theywere scattered by free electrons.

Because the photon has lost energy to the electron, the wavelength of thephoton has increased.In this collision, both (relativistic) momentum and energy are conserved.

( 5). This is the physical basis for the force exerted by radiation upon matter.3THE BOHR MODEL OF THE ATOMThe pioneering work of Planck, Einstein, and others at the beginning of the twentiethcentury revealed thewave‚Äìparticle dualityof light. Light exhibits its wave properties asitpropagatesthrough space, as demonstrated by its double-slit interference pattern. Onthe other hand, light manifests its particle nature when itinteractswith matter, as in thephotoelectric and Compton effects. Planck‚Äôs formula describing the energy distribution ofblackbody radiation explained many of the features of the continuous spectrum of lightemitted by stars. But what physical process was responsible for the dark absorption linesscattered throughout the continuous spectrum of a star, or for the bright emission linesproduced by a hot, diffuse gas in the laboratory?The Structure of the AtomIn the very last years of the nineteenth century, Joseph John Thomson (1856‚Äì1940) discov-ered theelectronwhile working at Cambridge University‚Äôs Cavendish Laboratory. Becausebulk matter is electrically neutral, atoms were deduced to consist of negatively charged elec-trons and an equal positive charge of uncertain distribution. Ernest Rutherford (1871‚Äì1937)of New Zealand, working at England‚Äôs University of Manchester, discovered in 1911 thatan atom‚Äôs positive charge was concentrated in a tiny, massive nucleus. Rutherford directedhigh-speed alpha particles (now known to be helium nuclei) onto thin metal foils. He wasamazed to observe that a few of the alpha particles were bounced backward by the foilsinstead of plowing through them with only a slight deviation. Rutherford later wrote: ‚ÄúItwas quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almostas incredible as if you Ô¨Åred a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back andhit you.‚Äù Such an event could occur only as the result of a single collision of the alphaparticle with a minute, massive, positively charged nucleus. Rutherford calculated that theradius of the nucleus was 10,000 times smaller than the radius of the atom itself, showingthat ordinary matter is mostly empty space! He established that an electrically neutral atomconsists ofZelectrons (whereZis an integer), withZpositive elementary charges conÔ¨ÅnedThe Interaction of Light and Matter

to the nucleus. Rutherford coined the termprotonto refer to the nucleus of the hydrogenatom (Z=1), 1836 times more massive than the electron. But how were these chargesarranged?The Wavelengths of HydrogenThe experimental data were abundant. The wavelengths of 14 spectral lines of hydrogenhad been precisely determined. Those in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrumare 656.3 nm (red, HŒ±), 486.1 nm (turquoise, HŒ≤), 434.0 nm (blue, HŒ≥), and 410.2 nm(violet, HŒ¥). In 1885 a Swiss school teacher, Johann Balmer (1825‚Äì1898), had found, bytrial and error, a formula to reproduce the wavelengths of these spectral lines of hydrogen,today called theBalmer seriesorBalmer lines:1Œª=RH/parenleftbigg14‚àí1n2/parenrightbigg,(7)wheren=3,4,5,..., andRH=1.09677583√ó107¬±1.3m‚àí1is the experimentally de-termined Rydberg constant for hydrogen.7Balmer‚Äôs formula was very accurate, to withina fraction of a percent. Insertingn=3 gives the wavelength of the HŒ±Balmer line,n=4gives HŒ≤, and so on. Furthermore, Balmer realized that since 22=4, his formula could begeneralized to1Œª=RH/parenleftbigg1m2‚àí1n2/parenrightbigg,(8)withm<n(both integers). Many nonvisible spectral lines of hydrogen were found later,just as Balmer had predicted. Today, the lines corresponding tom=1 are calledLymanlines. The Lyman series of lines is found in the ultraviolet region of the electromagneticspectrum. Similarly, insertingm=3 into Eq. ( 8) produces the wavelengths of thePaschenseries of lines, which lie entirely in the infrared portion of the spectrum. The wavelengthsof important selected hydrogen lines are given in Table 2.Yet all of this was sheer numerology, with no foundation in the physics of the day. Physi-cists were frustrated by their inability to construct a model of even this simplest of atoms. Aplanetary model of the hydrogen atom, consisting of a central proton and one electron heldtogether by their mutual electrical attraction, should have been most amenable to analysis.However, a model consisting of a single electron and proton moving around their commoncenter of mass suffers from a basic instability. According to Maxwell‚Äôs equations of elec-tricity and magnetism, an accelerating electric charge emits electromagnetic radiation. Theorbiting electron should thus lose energy by emitting light with a continuously increasingfrequency (the orbital frequency) as it spirals down into the nucleus. This theoretical predic-tion of a continuous spectrum disagreed with the discrete emission lines actually observed.Even worse was the calculated timescale: The electron should plunge into the nucleus inonly 10‚àí8s. Obviously, matter is stable over much longer periods of time!7RHis named in honor of Johannes Rydberg (1854‚Äì1919), a Swedish spectroscopist.The Interaction of Light and Matter

A Danish physicist, Niels Bohr (1885‚Äì1962; see Fig. 4) cameto the rescue in 1913 with a daring proposal. The dimensions of Planck‚Äôs constant, J√ós,are equivalent to kg√óms‚àí1√óm, the units of angular momentum. Perhaps the angularmomentum of the orbiting electron was quantized. This quantization had been previouslyintroduced into atomic models by the British astronomer J. W. Nicholson. Although Bohrknew that Nicholson‚Äôs models were Ô¨Çawed, he recognized the possible signiÔ¨Åcance of thequantization of angular momentum. Just as an electromagnetic wave of frequencyŒΩcouldhave the energy of only an integral number of quanta,E=nhŒΩ, suppose that the valueof the angular momentum of the hydrogen atom could assume only integral multiples ofPlanck‚Äôs constant divided by 2œÄ:L=nh/2œÄ=n/planckover2pi1.8Bohr hypothesized that in orbits withprecisely these allowed values of the angular momentum, the electron would be stable andwould not radiatein spite of its centripetal acceleration. What would be the result of sucha bold departure from classical physics?To analyze the mechanical motion of the atomic electron‚Äìproton system, we start withthe mathematical description of their electrical attraction given byCoulomb‚Äôs law.

Thus theelectron can orbit at a distance ofa0,4a0,9a0,...from the proton, but no other separationsare allowed. According to Bohr‚Äôs hypothesis, when the electron is in one of these orbits,the atom is stable and emits no radiation.Inserting this expression forrinto Eq. ( 11) reveals that the allowed energies of theBohr atom areEn=‚àí¬µe432œÄ2œµ20/planckover2pi121n2=‚àí13.6 eV1n2.(14)The integern, known as theprincipal quantum number, completely determines the char-acteristics of each orbit of the Bohr atom. Thus, when the electron is in the lowest orbit (theground state), withn=1 andr1=a0, its energy isE1=‚àí13.6 eV . With the electron inthe ground state, it would take at least 13.6 eV to ionize the atom. When the electron is intheÔ¨Årst excited state, withn=2 andr2=4a0, its energy is greater than it is in the groundstate:E2=‚àí13.6/4 eV=‚àí3.40 eV .If the electron does not radiate in any of its allowed orbits, then what is the origin of thespectral lines observed for hydrogen? Bohr proposed that a photon is emitted or absorbedwhen an electron makes a transition from one orbit to another. Consider an electron as it‚Äúfalls‚Äù from a higher orbit,nhigh, to a lower orbit,nlow, without stopping at any intermediateorbit. (This isnota fall in the classical sense; the electron isneverobserved between thetwo orbits.) The electron loses energy/Delta1E=Ehigh‚àíElow, and this energy is carried awayfrom the atom by a single photon.

This result is within 0.03%of the measured value of the HŒ±spectral line, as quoted in Example 1.1 and Table 2.The discrepancy between the calculated and the observed values is due to the measure-ments being made in air rather than in vacuum. Near sea level, the speed of light is slowerthan in vacuum by a factor ofapproximately1.000297.

This result differs from the quoted value by only 0.0009%. The remainder of the discrepancyis due to the fact that the index of refraction is wavelength dependent. The index of refractionalso depends on environmental conditions such as temperature, pressure, and humidity.12Unless otherwise noted, throughout the remainder of this text, wavelengths will be as-sumed to be measured in air (from the ground).The reverse process may also occur. If a photon has an energy equal to thedifferencein energy between two orbits (with the electron in the lower orbit), the photon may beabsorbed by the atom. The electron uses the photon‚Äôs energy to make an upward transitionfrom the lower orbit to the higher orbit. The relation between the photon‚Äôs wavelength andthe quantum numbers of the two orbits is again given by Eq. (15).After the quantum revolution, the physical processes responsible for Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws(discussed in Section 1) Ô¨Ånally became clear.‚Ä¢ A hot, dense gas or hot solid object produces a continuous spectrum with no darkspectral lines. This is the continuous spectrum of blackbody radiation emitted at anytemperature above absolute zero and described by the Planck functionsBŒª(T )andBŒΩ(T ). The wavelengthŒªmaxat which the Planck functionBŒª(T )obtains its maximumvalue is given by Wien‚Äôs displacement law‚Ä¢ A hot, diffuse gas produces bright emission lines. Emission lines are produced whenan electron makes a downward transition from a higher orbit to a lower orbit. Theenergy lost by the electron is carried away by a single photon. For example, thehydrogen Balmer emission lines are produced by electrons ‚Äúfalling‚Äù from higherorbits down to then=2 orbit; see Fig. 6(a).‚Ä¢ A cool, diffuse gas in front of a source of a continuous spectrum produces darkabsorption lines in the continuous spectrum. Absorption lines are produced whenan electron makes a transition from a lower orbit to a higher orbit.

For example, the hydrogen Balmer absorption lines are produced byatoms absorbing photons that cause electrons to make transitions from then=2orbit to higher orbits; see Figs. 6(b) and 7.Despite the spectacular successes of Bohr‚Äôs model of the hydrogen atom, it is not quitecorrect. Although angular momentum is quantized, itdoes nothave the values assignedby Bohr.13Bohr painted asemiclassicalpicture of the hydrogen atom, a miniature SolarSystem with an electron circling the proton in a classical circular orbit. In fact, the electronorbits are not circular. They are not even orbits at all, in the classical sense of an electronat a precise location moving with a precise velocity. Instead, on an atomic level, nature is‚Äúfuzzy,‚Äù with an attendant uncertainty that cannot be avoided. It was fortunate that Bohr‚Äôsmodel, with all of its faults, led to the correct values for the energies of the orbits and toa correct interpretation of the formation of spectral lines. This intuitive, easily imaginedmodel of the atom is what most physicists and astronomers have in mind when they visualizeatomic processes.4QUANTUM MECHANICS AND WAVE‚ÄìPARTICLE DUALITYThe last act of the quantum revolution began with the musings of a French prince, Louis deBroglie (1892‚Äì1987; see Fig. 8). Wondering about the recently discovered wave‚Äìparticleduality for light, he posed a profound question: If light (classically thought to be a wave)13As we will see in the next section, instead ofL=n/planckover2pi1, the actual values of the orbital angular momentum areL=‚àö‚Ñì(‚Ñì+1)/planckover2pi1, where‚Ñì, an integer, is a new quantum number.The Interaction of Light and Matter

(5):ŒΩ=EhŒª=hp.(16)(17)de Broglie proposed that these equations be used to deÔ¨Åne a frequency and a wavelengthforallparticles. Thede Broglie wavelengthandfrequencydescribe not only massless pho-tons but massive electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms, molecules, people, planets, stars, andgalaxies as well. This seemingly outrageous proposal of matter waves has been conÔ¨Årmedin countless experiments. Figure 9 shows the interference pattern produced byelectronsin a double-slit experiment. Just as Thomas Young‚Äôs double-slit experiment established thewave properties of light, the electron double-slit experiment can be explained only by thewave-like behavior of electrons, witheachelectron propagating throughbothslits.14Thewave‚Äìparticle duality applies to everything in the physical world; everything exhibits itswave properties in itspropagationand manifests its particle nature in itsinteractions.14See Chapter 6 of Feynman (1965) for a fascinating description of the details and profound implications of theelectron double-slit experiment.The Interaction of Light and Matter

For the electron,Œª=hp=hmev=0.242 nm,which is about the size of an atom and much shorter than the wavelength of visible light.Electron microscopes utilize electrons with wavelengths one million times shorter thanvisible wavelengths to obtain a much higher resolution than is possible with optical micro-scopes.The wavelength of the jogging man isŒª=hp=hmmanv=3.16√ó10‚àí36m,which is completely negligible on the scale of the everyday world, and even on atomic ornuclear scales. Thus the jogging gentleman need not worry about diffracting when returninghome through his doorway!Just what are the waves that are involved in the wave‚Äìparticle duality of nature? Ina double-slit experiment, each photon or electron must pass throughbothslits, since theinterference pattern is produced by the constructive and destructive interference of the twowaves. Thus the wave cannot convey information about where the photon or electron is,but only about where itmaybe. The wave is one ofprobability, and its amplitude is denotedby the Greek letter/Psi1(psi). The square of the wave amplitude,|/Psi1|2, at a certain locationdescribes the probability of Ô¨Ånding the photon or electron at that location.

Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty PrincipleThe wave attributes of matter lead to some unexpected conclusions of paramount importancefor the science of astronomy. For example, consider Fig. 10(a). The probability wave,/Psi1, is a sine wave, with a precise wavelengthŒª. Thus the momentump=h/Œªof theparticle described by this wave is known exactly. However, because|/Psi1|2consists of anumber of equally high peaks extending out tox=¬± ‚àû, the particle‚Äôs location is perfectlyuncertain. The particle‚Äôs position can be narrowed down if several sine waves with differentwavelengths are added together, so they destructively interfere with one another nearlyeverywhere. Figure 10(b) shows the resulting combination of waves,/Psi1, is approximatelyzero everywhere except at one location. Now the particle‚Äôs position may be determinedwith a greater certainty because|/Psi1|2is large only for a narrow range of values ofx.However, the value of the particle‚Äôs momentum has become more uncertain because/Psi1isnow a combination of waves of various wavelengths. This is nature‚Äôs intrinsic trade-off:The uncertainty in a particle‚Äôs position,/Delta1x, and the uncertainty in its momentum,/Delta1p, areinversely related. As one decreases, the other must increase. This fundamental inability of aparticle tosimultaneouslyhave a well-deÔ¨Åned position and a well-deÔ¨Åned momentum is adirect result of the wave‚Äìparticle duality of nature. A German physicist, Werner Heisenberg(1901‚Äì1976), placed this inherent ‚Äúfuzziness‚Äù of the physical world in a Ô¨Årm theoreticalframework. He demonstrated that the uncertainty in a particle‚Äôs position multiplied by theuncertainty in its momentum must beat leastas large as/planckover2pi1/2:/Delta1x /Delta1p‚â•12/planckover2pi1.(18)Today this is known asHeisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle. The equality is rarely realizedin nature, and the form often employed for making estimates is/Delta1x /Delta1p‚âà/planckover2pi1.(19)A similar statement relates the uncertainty of an energy measurement,/Delta1E, and the timeinterval,/Delta1t, over which the energy measurement is taken:/Delta1E /Delta1t‚âà/planckover2pi1.(20)

As the time available for an energy measurement increases, the inherent uncertainty in theresult decreases.Example 4.2.Imagine an electron conÔ¨Åned within a region of space the size of a hy-drogen atom. We can estimate the minimum speed and kinetic energy of the electron usingHeisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle. Because we know only that the particle is within anatom-size region of space, we can take/Delta1x‚âàa0=5.29√ó10‚àí11m. This implies that theuncertainty in the electron‚Äôs momentum is roughly/Delta1p‚âà/planckover2pi1/Delta1x=1.98√ó10‚àí24kg m s‚àí1.Thus, if the magnitude of the momentum of the electron were repeatedly measured, theresulting values would vary within a range¬±/Delta1paround some average (orexpected) value.Since this expected value, as well as the individual measurements, must be‚â•0, the expectedvalue must be at least as large as/Delta1p. Thus we can equate the minimum expected value ofthe momentum with its uncertainty:pmin‚âà/Delta1p. Usingpmin=mevmin, the minimum speedof the electron is estimated to bevmin=pminme‚âà/Delta1pme‚âà2.18√ó106ms‚àí1.The minimum kinetic energy of the (nonrelativistic) electron is approximatelyKmin=12mev2min‚âà2.16√ó10‚àí18J=13.5 eV.This is in good agreement with the kinetic energy of the electron in the ground state ofthe hydrogen atom.

Then the evanescent wavein the air may enter the second prism before its amplitude has completely died away. Theelectromagnetic wave once again becomes oscillatory upon entering the glass, and so theray of light has traveled from one prism to another without passing through the air gapbetween the prisms. In the language of particles, photons havetunneledfrom one prism toanother without traveling in the space between them.The wave‚Äìparticle duality of nature implies that particles can also tunnel through a regionof space (a barrier) in which they cannot exist classically, as illustrated in Fig. 11. Thebarrier must not be too wide (not more than a few particle wavelengths) if tunneling is to takeplace; otherwise, the amplitude of the evanescent wave will have declined to nearly zero.This is consistent with Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle, which implies that a particle‚Äôslocation cannot be determined with an uncertainty that is less than its wavelength. Thus, ifthe barrier is only a few wavelengths wide, the particle may suddenly appear on the otherside of the barrier.Barrier penetrationis extremely important in radioactive decay, wherealpha particles tunnel out of an atom‚Äôs nucleus; in modern electronics, where it is the basisfor the ‚Äútunnel diode‚Äù; and inside stars, where the rates of nuclear fusion reactions dependupon tunneling.Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Equation and the Quantum Mechanical AtomWhat are the implications for Bohr‚Äôs model of the hydrogen atom? Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertaintyprinciple does not allow classical orbits, with their simultaneously precise values of theelectron‚Äôs position and momentum. Instead, the electronorbitalsmust be imagined as fuzzyclouds of probability, with the clouds being more ‚Äúdense‚Äù in regions where the electron ismore likely to be found (see Fig. 12).

equation can be solved for the probability waves that describe the allowed values of a par-
ticle‚Äôs energy, momentum, and so on, as well as the particle‚Äôs propagation through space.
In particular, the Schr√∂dinger equation can be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom,
giving exactly the same set of allowed energies as those obtained by Bohr (cf. Eq. 11).
However, in addition to the principal quantum number n, Schr√∂dinger found that two addi-
tional quantum numbers, ‚Ñìandm‚Ñì, are required for a complete description of the electron
orbitals. These additional numbers describe the angular momentum vector, L, of the atom.
Instead of the quantization used by Bohr, L=n/planckover2pi1, the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation
shows that the permitted values of the magnitude of the angular momentum Lare actually
L=/radicalbig
‚Ñì(‚Ñì+1)/planckover2pi1, (21)
where ‚Ñì=0,1,2,...,n ‚àí1, and nis the principal quantum number that determines the
energy.
Note that it is common practice to refer to the angular momentum quantum numbers by
their historical spectroscopic designations s,p,d,f,g,h, and so on, corresponding to ‚Ñì=0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. When the associated principle quantum number is used in combination
with the angular momentum quantum number, the principle quantum number precedes the
spectroscopic designation. For example, ( n=2,‚Ñì=1) corresponds to 2 p, and ( n=3,
‚Ñì=2) is given as 3 d. This notation was used in the caption of Fig. 12 and is also used in
Fig. 13.
The z-component of the angular momentum vector, Lz, can assume only the values
Lz=m‚Ñì/planckover2pi1, with m‚Ñìequal to any of the 2 ‚Ñì+1 integers between ‚àí‚Ñìand+‚Ñìinclusive. Thus
the angular momentum vector can point in 2 ‚Ñì+1 different directions. For our purposes, the
important point is that the values of the energy of an isolated hydrogen atom do not depend
on‚Ñìandm‚Ñì. In the absence of a preferred direction in space, the direction of the angular
momentum has no effect on the atom‚Äôs energy. Different orbitals, labeled by different values
of‚Ñìandm‚Ñì(see Fig. 12), are said to be degenerate if they have the same value of the
principal quantum number nand so have the same energy. Electrons making a transition
from a given orbital to one of several degenerate orbitals will produce the same spectral
line, because they experience the same change in energy.The Interaction of Light and Matter

FIGURE 13Splitting of absorption lines by the Zeeman effect.However, the atom‚Äôs surroundings may single out one spatial direction as being differentfrom another. For example, an electron in an atom will feel the effect of an external magneticÔ¨Åeld. The magnitude of this effect will depend on the 2‚Ñì+1 possible orientations of theelectron‚Äôs motion, as given bym‚Ñì, and the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength,B, where the unitsofBare teslas (T).15As the electron moves through the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, the normallydegenerate orbitals acquire slightly different energies. Electrons making a transition betweenthese formerly degenerate orbitals will thus produce spectral lines with slightly differentfrequencies. The splitting of spectral lines in a weak magnetic Ô¨Åeld is called theZeemaneffectand is shown in Fig. 13. The three frequencies of the split lines in the simplest case(called thenormal Zeeman effect) areŒΩ=ŒΩ0andŒΩ0¬±eB4œÄ¬µ,(22)whereŒΩ0is the frequency of the spectral line in the absence of a magnetic Ô¨Åeld and¬µis thereduced mass. Although the energy levels are split into 2‚Ñì+1 components, electron transi-tions involving these levels produce just three spectral lines with different polarizations.16Viewed from different directions, it may happen that not all three lines will be visible. Forexample, when looking parallel to the magnetic Ô¨Åeld (as when looking down on a sunspot),the unshifted line of frequencyŒΩ0is absent.Thus the Zeeman effect gives astronomers a probe of the magnetic Ô¨Åelds observedaround sunspots and on other stars. Even if the splitting of the spectral line is too small tobe directly detected, the different polarizations across the closely spaced components canstill be measured and the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength deduced.Example 4.3.Interstellar clouds may contain very weak magnetic Ô¨Åelds, as small asB‚âà2√ó10‚àí10T. Nevertheless, astronomers have been able to measure this magneticÔ¨Åeld. Using radio telescopes, they detect the variation in polarization that occurs across the15Another commonly used unit of magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is gauss, where 1 G=10‚àí4T.Earth‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld isroughly 0.5 G, or 5√ó10‚àí5T.16See the ection,  The Complex Spectra of Atoms ,  concerning selection rules.,,,,SThe Interaction of Light and Matter

The change in frequency,/Delta1ŒΩ, produced by a magnetic Ô¨Åeld of thismagnitude can be calculated from Eq. ( 22) by using the mass of the electron,me, for thereduced mass¬µ:/Delta1ŒΩ=eB4œÄme=2.8 Hz,a minute change. The total difference in frequency from one side of this blended line tothe other is twice this amount, or 6 Hz. For comparison, the frequency of the radio waveemitted by hydrogen withŒª=21 cm isŒΩ=c/Œª=1.4√ó109Hz, 250 million times larger!Spin and the Pauli Exclusion PrincipleAttempts to understand more complicated patterns of magnetic Ô¨Åeld splitting (theanomalousZeeman effect), usually involving an even number of unequally spaced spectral lines, ledphysicists in 1925 to discover afourthquantum number. In addition to its orbital motion,the electron possesses aspin.

The only values of the fourth quantum number,ms, are¬±12.With each orbital, orquantum state, labeled by four quantum numbers, physicists won-dered how many electrons in a multielectron atom could occupy the same quantum state.The answer was supplied in 1925 by an Austrian theoretical physicist, Wolfgang Pauli(1900‚Äì1958): No two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. ThePauli exclusionprinciple, thatno two electrons can share the same set of four quantum numbers, explainedthe electronic structure of atoms, thereby providing an explanation of the properties of theperiodic table of the elements, the well-known chart from any introductory chemistry text.Despite this success, Pauli was unhappy about the lack of a Ô¨Årm theoretical understandingof electron spin. Spin was stitched onto quantum theory in an ad hoc manner, and the seamsshowed. Pauli lamented this patchwork theory and asked, ‚ÄúHow can one avoid despondencyif one thinks of the anomalous Zeeman effect?‚ÄùThe Ô¨Ånal synthesis arrived in 1928 from an unexpected source. A brilliant English the-oretical physicist, Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902‚Äì1984), was working at Cambridge tocombine Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs wave equation with Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity. When heÔ¨Ånally succeeded in writing a relativistic wave equation for the electron, he was delightedto see that the mathematical solution automatically included the spin of the electron. It alsoexplained and extended the Pauli exclusion principle by dividing the world of particles intotwo fundamental groups: fermions and bosons.Fermions17are particles such as electrons,17The fermion is named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901‚Äì1954).The Interaction of Light and Matter

protons, and neutrons18that have a spin of12/planckover2pi1(or an odd integer times12/planckover2pi1, such as32/planckover2pi1,52/planckover2pi1,...). Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two fermions of the same typecan have the same set of quantum numbers. The exclusion principle for fermions, alongwith Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty relation, explains the structure of white dwarfs and neutronstarsBosons19are particles such as photons that haveanintegralspinof0,/planckover2pi1,2/planckover2pi1,3/planckover2pi1,....BosonsdonotobeythePauliexclusionprinciple,soanynumberofbosonscanoccupythesamequantumstate.As a Ô¨Ånal bonus, the Dirac equation predicted the existence of antiparticles.Aparticle andits antiparticle are identical except for their opposite electric charges and magnetic moments.Pairs of particles and antiparticles may be created from the energy of gamma-ray photons(according toE=mc2). Conversely, particle‚Äìantiparticle pairs may annihilate each other,with their mass converted back into the energy of two gamma-ray photons.holes.The Complex Spectra of AtomsWith the full list of four quantum numbers (n,‚Ñì,m‚Ñì, andms) that describe the detailedstate an each electron in an atom, the number of possible energy levels increases rapidlywith the number of electrons. When we take into account the additional complications ofexternal magnetic Ô¨Åelds, and the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons them-selves and between the electrons and the nucleus, the spectra can become very complicatedindeed. Figure 14 shows some of the available energy levels for the two electrons in theneutral helium atom.20Imagine the complexity of the relatively abundant iron atom withits 26 electrons!Although energy levels exist for electrons with various combinations of quantum num-bers, it is not always easy for an electron to make a transition from one quantum state witha speciÔ¨Åc set of quantum numbers to another quantum state. In particular, Nature imposesa set ofselection rulesthat restrict certain transitions. For example, a careful investigationof Fig. 14 will show that only transitions involving/Delta1‚Ñì=¬±1 are shown (from1Pto1S,or from1Fto1D, for instance). These transitions are referred to asallowedtransitions andcan happen spontaneously on timescales of 10‚àí8s. On the other hand, transitions that donot satisfy the requirement that/Delta1‚Ñì=¬±1 are known asforbiddentransitions.In the case of the Zeeman effect Ô¨Årst discussed on page 134, it was pointed out that onlythree transitions could occur between the 1sand 2penergy levels (recall Fig. 13). Thisis because of another set of selection rules requiring that/Delta1m‚Ñì=0 or¬±1 and forbiddingtransitions between orbitals if both orbitals havem‚Ñì=0.Although forbidden transitions may occur, they require much longer times if they are tooccur with any signiÔ¨Åcant probability. Since collisions between atoms trigger transitionsand can compete with spontaneous transitions, very low gas densities are required formeasurable intensities to be observed from forbidden transitions. Such environments doexist in astronomy, such as in the diffuse interstellar medium or in the outer atmospheres18The neutron was not discovered until 1932 by James Chadwick (1891‚Äì1974), the same year that the positron(antimatter electron) was discovered by Carl Anderson (1905‚Äì1991).19The boson is named in honor of the Indian physicist S. N. Bose (1894‚Äì1974).20Figure 14 is known as a Grotrian diagram..

(It is beyond the scope of this text to discuss the detailed physics that underlies theexistence of selection rules.)The revolution in physics started by Max Planck culminated in the quantum atom andgave astronomers their most powerful tool: a theory that would enable them to analyze thespectral lines observed for stars, galaxies, and nebulae.21Different atoms, and combina-tions of atoms in molecules, have orbitals of distinctly different energies; thus they can beidentiÔ¨Åed by their spectral line ‚ÄúÔ¨Ångerprints.‚Äù The speciÔ¨Åc spectral lines produced by anatom or molecule depend on which orbitals are occupied by electrons. This, in turn, dependson its surroundings: the temperature, density, and pressure of its environment. These andother factors, such as the strength of a surrounding magnetic Ô¨Åeld, may be determined bya careful examination of spectral lines.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralFeynman, Richard,The Character of Physical Law, The M.I.T.

PROBLEM
1Barnard‚Äôs star, named after the American astronomer Edward E. Barnard (1857‚Äì1923), is
an orange star in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has the largest known proper motion ( ¬µ=
10.3577‚Ä≤‚Ä≤yr‚àí1) and the fourth-largest parallax angle ( p=0.54901‚Ä≤‚Ä≤). Only the stars in the
triple system Œ±Centauri have larger parallax angles. In the spectrum of Barnard‚Äôs star, the
HŒ±absorption line is observed to have a wavelength of 656.034 nm when measured from
the ground.
(a)Determine the radial velocity of Barnard‚Äôs star.
(b)Determine the transverse velocity of Barnard‚Äôs star.
(c)Calculate the speed of Barnard‚Äôs star through space.
2When salt is sprinkled on a Ô¨Çame, yellow light consisting of two closely spaced wavelengths,
588.997 nm and 589.594 nm, is produced. They are called the sodium D lines and were observed
by Fraunhofer in the Sun‚Äôs spectrum.
(a)If this light falls on a diffraction grating with 300 lines per millimeter, what is the angle
between the second-order spectra of these two wavelengths?
(b)How many lines of this grating must be illuminated for the sodium D lines to just be
resolved?
3Show that hc‚âÉ1240 eV nm.
4The photoelectric effect can be an important heating mechanism for the grains of dust found
in interstellar clouds (see Section 12.1). The ejection of an electron leaves the grain with a
positive charge, which affects the rates at which other electrons and ions collide with and stick
to the grain to produce the heating. This process is particularly effective for ultraviolet photons
(Œª‚âà100 nm) striking the smaller dust grains. If the average energy of the ejected electron is
about 5 eV , estimate the work function of a typical dust grain.

The circumference of theelectron‚Äôs orbit must be an integral number of wavelengths,nŒª; see Fig. 15. Otherwise, theelectron wave will Ô¨Ånd itselfout of phaseand suffer destructive interference. Show that thisrequirement leads to Bohr‚Äôs condition for the quantization of angular momentum, Eq. ( 12).

PROBLEM
1For some point Pin space, show that for any arbitrary closed surface surrounding P, the integral
over a solid angle about Pgives
/Omega1tot=/contintegraldisplay
d/Omega1=4œÄ.
2The light rays coming from an object do not, in general, travel parallel to the optical axis of
a lens or mirror system. Consider an arrow to be the object, located a distance pfrom the
center of a simple converging lens of focal length f, such that p>f . Assume that the arrow is
perpendicular to the optical axis of the system with the tail of the arrow located on the axis. To
locate the image, draw two light rays coming from the tip of the arrow:
(i)One ray should follow a path parallel to the optical axis until it strikes the lens. It then bends
toward the focal point of the side of the lens opposite the object.
(ii)A second ray should pass directly through the center of the lens unde Ô¨Çected. (This assumes
that the lens is suf Ô¨Åciently thin.)
The intersection of the two rays is the location of the tip of the image arrow. All other rays
coming from the tip of the object that pass through the lens will also pass through the image tip.
The tail of the image is located on the optical axis, a distance qfrom the center of the lens. The
image should also be oriented perpendicular to the optical axis.
(a)Using similar triangles, prove the relation
1
p+1
q=1
f.
(b)Show that if the distance of the object is much larger than the focal length of the lens
(p‚â´f), then the image is effectively located on the focal plane. This is essentially always
the situation for astronomical observations.
The analysis of a diverging lens or a mirror (either converging or diverging) is similar and leads
to the same relation between object distance, image distance, and focal length.
3Show that if two lenses of focal lengths f1andf2can be considered to have zero physical
separation, then the effective focal length of the combination of lenses is
1
feff=1
f1+1
f2.
Note: Assuming that the actual physical separation of the lenses is x, this approximation is strictly
valid only when f1‚â´xandf2‚â´x.
4 (a) Using the result of Problem 3, show that a compound lens system can be constructed from
two lenses of different indices of refraction, n1Œªandn2Œª, having the property that the resultant
focal lengths of the compound lens at two speci Ô¨Åc wavelengths Œª1andŒª2, respectively, can
be made equal, or
feff,Œª1=feff,Œª2.
(b)Argue qualitatively that this condition does not guarantee that the focal length will be constant
for all wavelengths.Telescopes

Assume also that the two slits are the same distance fromaÔ¨Çat screen. Different light sources of identical intensity are placed behind each slit so that thetwo sources are incoherent, which means that double-slit interference effects can be neglected.(a)If the two slits are separated by a distance such that the central maximum of the diffractionpattern corresponding to theÔ¨Årst slit is located at the second minimum of the second slit‚Äôsdiffraction pattern, plot the resulting superposition of intensities (i.e., the total intensity ateach location).

planets discovered by the radial velocity technique are quite close to their parent star and very massive. For instance, the lower limit for the mass of the planet orbiting 51 Peg is 0.45 MJ (where MJ is the mass of Jupiter), it has an orbital period of just 4.23077 d, and the semimajor axis of its orbit is only 0.051 AU. The lower limit on the mass of the planet orbiting HD 168443c is 16.96 MJ, its orbital period is 1770 d, and the semimajor axis of its orbit is 2.87 AU. As the length of time that stars are observed increases, longer orbital-period planets will continue to be discovered, as will lower-mass planets.to measure radial velocity. Pulsations of the surface of the star, surface con-vection and the movement of surface features such as star spots, can also con-fuse the measurements and degrade the velocity resolution limit.

Its measured trigonometric parallax is0.37921‚Ä≤‚Ä≤¬±0.00158‚Ä≤‚Ä≤and, assuming that the plane of the orbit is in the plane of the sky, thetrue angular extent of the semimajor axis of the reduced mass is 7.61‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. The ratio of the distancesof Sirius A and Sirius B from the center of mass isaA/aB=0.466.(a)Find the mass of each member of the system.(b)The absolute bolometric magnitude of Sirius A is 1.36, and Sirius B has an absolute bolo-metric magnitude of 8.79. Determine their luminosities. Express your answers in terms ofthe luminosity of the Sun.(c)The effective temperature of Sirius B is approximately 24,790 K¬±100 K. Estimate its radius,and compare your answer to the radii of the Sun and Earth.5Œ∂Phe is a 1.67-day spectroscopic binary with nearly circular orbits.

The ClassiÔ¨Åcation of Stellar Spectra1The Formation of Spectral Lines2The Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell Diagram1THE FORMATION OF SPECTRAL LINESWith the invention of photometry and spectroscopy, the new science ofastrophysicspro-gressed rapidly. As early as 1817, Joseph Fraunhofer had determined that different starshave different spectra. Stellar spectra were classiÔ¨Åed according to several schemes, the ear-liest of which recognized just three types of spectra. As instruments improved, increasinglysubtle distinctions became possible.The Spectral Types of StarsA spectral taxonomy developed at Harvard by Edward C. Pickering (1846‚Äì1919) and hisassistant Williamina P. Fleming (1857‚Äì1911) in the 1890s labeled spectra with capital let-ters according to the strength of their hydrogen absorption lines, beginning with the letterA for the broadest lines. At about the same time, Antonia Maury (1866‚Äì1952), another ofPickering‚Äôs assistants and a colleague of Fleming‚Äôs, was developing a somewhat differ-ent classiÔ¨Åcation scheme that she was using to study the widths of spectral lines. In herwork Maury rearranged her classes in a way that would have been equivalent to placingPickering‚Äôs and Fleming‚Äôs B class before the A stars. Then, in 1901, Annie Jump Cannon1(1863‚Äì1941; see Fig. 1), also employed by Pickering, and using the scheme of Pickeringand Fleming while following the suggestion of Maury, rearranged the sequence of spectraby placing O and B before A, added decimal subdivisions (e.g., A0‚ÄìA9), and consolidatedmany of the classes. With these changes, the Harvard classiÔ¨Åcation scheme of ‚ÄúO B A F G KM‚Äù became atemperaturesequence, running from the hottest blue O stars to the coolest redM stars. Generations of astronomy students have remembered this string ofspectral typesby memorizing the phrase ‚ÄúOh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me.‚Äù Stars nearer the beginningof this sequence are referred to asearly-typestars, and those closer to the end are calledlate-typestars. These labels also distinguish the stars within the spectral subdivisions, soastronomers may speak of a K0 star as an ‚Äúearly K star‚Äù or refer to a B9 star as a ‚Äúlate Bstar.‚Äù Cannon classiÔ¨Åed some 200,000 spectra between 1911 and 1914, and the results were1The Annie J.

(Courtesy of Harvard College Observatory.)collected into theHenry Draper Catalogue.2Today, many stars are referred to by theirHD numbers; Betelgeuse is HD 39801.The physical basis of the Harvard spectral classiÔ¨Åcation scheme remained obscure, how-ever. Vega (spectral type A0) displays very strong hydrogen absorption lines, much strongerthan the faint lines observed for the Sun (spectral type G2). On the other hand, the Sun‚Äôscalcium absorption lines are much more intense than those of Vega. Is this a result of avariation in thecompositionof the two stars? Or are the different surface temperatures ofVega (Te=9500 K) and the Sun (Te=5777 K) responsible for the relative strengths of theabsorption lines?The theoretical understanding of the quantum atom achieved early in the twentieth cen-tury gave astronomers the key to the secrets of stellar spectra.for an electron to make an upward transition from a lower to a higher orbital. Emission linesare formed in the inverse process, when an electron makes a downward transition from ahigher to a lower orbital and a single photon carries away the energy lost by the elec-tron. The wavelength of the photon thus depends on the energies of the atomic orbitalsinvolved in these transitions. For example, the Balmer absorption lines of hydrogen arecaused by electrons making upward transitions from then=2 orbital to higher-energy or-bitals, and Balmer emission lines are produced when electrons make downward transitionsfrom higher-energy orbitals to then=2 orbital.The distinctions between the spectra of stars with different temperatures are due toelectrons occupying different atomic orbitals in the atmospheres of these stars. The detailsof spectral line formation can be quite complicated because electrons can be found in any ofan atom‚Äôs orbitals. Furthermore, the atom can be in any one of various stages of ionizationand has a unique set of orbitals at each stage. An atom‚Äôs stage of ionization is denoted by a2In 1872 Henry Draper took the Ô¨Årst photograph of a stellar spectrum.

Roman numeral following the symbol for the atom. For example, H I and He I are neutral(not ionized) hydrogen and helium, respectively; He II is singly ionized helium, and Si IIIand Si IV refer to a silicon atom that has lost two and three electrons, respectively.In the Harvard system devised by Cannon, the Balmer lines reach their maximum inten-sity in the spectra of stars of type A0, which have an effective temperature ofTe=9520 K.Thevisiblespectrallinesofneutralhelium(HeI)arestrongestforB2stars (Te=22,000 K), and the visible spectral lines of singly ionized calcium (Ca II) aremost intense for K0 stars (Te=5250 K).3Table 1 lists some of the deÔ¨Åning criteria for various spectral types. In the table thetermmetalis used to indicate any element heavier than helium, a convention commonlyadopted by astronomers because by far the most abundant elements in the universe arehydrogen and helium.(1300 K to 2500 K for L spectral types and less than 1300 K for T spectral types).4Inorder to remember the new, cooler spectral types, one might consider extending the popularmnemonic by: ‚ÄúOh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me‚ÄîLess Talk!‚ÄùFigures 2 and 3 display some sample photographic spectra for various spectral types.You will note that hydrogen lines [e.g., HŒ≥(434.4 nm) and HŒ¥(410.1 nm)] increase in width(strength) from O9 to A0, then decrease in width from A0 through F5, and nearly vanishby late K. Helium (He) lines are discernible in the spectra of early-type stars (O and earlyB) but begin to disappear in cooler stars.Figures 4 and 5 also depict stellar spectra in a graphical format typical of moderndigital detectors. Readily apparent is the shifting to longer wavelengths of the peak of thesuperimposed blackbody spectrum as the temperature of the star decreases (later spectraltypes). Also apparent are the HŒ±,HŒ≤,HŒ≥, and HŒ¥Balmer lines at 656.2 nm, 486.1 nm,434.0 nm, and 410.2 nm, respectively. Note how these hydrogen absorption lines growin strength from O to A and then decrease in strength for spectral types later than A. Forlater spectral types, the messy spectra are indicative of metal lines, with molecular linesappearing in the spectra of the coolest stars.The Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann Velocity DistributionTo uncover the physical foundation of this classiÔ¨Åcation system, two basic questions mustbe answered: In what orbitals are electrons most likely to be found? What are the relativenumbers of atoms in various stages of ionization?3The two prominent spectral lines of Ca II are usually referred to as the H (Œª=396.8 nm) and K (Œª=393.3 nm)lines of calcium. The nomenclature for the H line was devised by Fraunhofer; the K line was named by E. Mascart(1837‚Äì1908) in the 1860s.4The surveys that discovered large numbers of these objects are the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS).The Classification of Stellar Spectra
In addition to the traditional spectral types of the Harvard classiÔ¨Åcation scheme (OBAFGKM), Table   1 also includes recently deÔ¨Åned spectral types of very cool stars and brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are objects with too little mass to allow nuclear reac-tions to occur in their interiors in any substantial way, so they are not considered stars in the usual sense. The necessity of introducing these new spectral types came from all-sky surveys that detected a large number of objects with very low effective temperatures

As a result, the distribution inthe speeds of the impacting atoms, given by Eq. ( 1), produces a deÔ¨Ånite distribution ofthe electrons among the atomic orbitals. This distribution of electrons is governed by afundamental result of statistical mechanics: Orbitals of higher energy are less likely to beoccupied by electrons.Letsastand for the speciÔ¨Åc set of quantum numbers that identiÔ¨Åes a state of energyEafor a system of particles. Similarly, letsbstand for the set of quantum numbers that identiÔ¨Åesa state of energyEb.

(Data from Silva and Cornell,Ap. J. Suppl.,81, 865, 1992.)The Boltzmann factor plays such a fundamental role in the study of statistical mechanicsthat Eq. ( 5) merits further consideration. Suppose, for example, thatEb>Ea; the energyof statesbis greater than the energy of statesa. Notice that as the thermal energykTdecreasestoward zero (i.e.,T‚Üí0), the quantity‚àí(Eb‚àíEa)/kT‚Üí‚àí ‚àû, and soP (sb)/P (sa)‚Üí0.This is just what is to be expected if there isn‚Äôt any thermal energy available to raise theenergy of an atom to a higher level. On the other hand, if there is a great deal of thermalenergy available (i.e.,T‚Üí‚àû), then‚àí(Eb‚àíEa)/kT‚Üí0 andP (sb)/P (sa)‚Üí1. Againthis is what would be expected since with an unlimited reservoir of thermal energy, allavailable energy levels of the atom should be accessible with equal probability. You canquickly verify that if we had assumed instead thatEb<Ea, the expected results wouldagain be obtained in the limits ofT‚Üí0 andT‚Üí‚àû.It is often the case that the energy levels of the system may bedegenerate, with morethan one quantum state having the same energy. That is, if statessaandsbare degenerate,thenEa=EbbutsaÃ∏=sb. When taking averages, we must count each of the degeneratestates separately. To account properly for the number of states that have a given energy,deÔ¨Ånegato be the number of states with energyEa. Similarly, deÔ¨Ånegbto be the numberof states with energyEb.

Solving for the temperature yields10T=10.2 eVkln(4)=8.54√ó104K.High temperatures are required for a signiÔ¨Åcant number of hydrogen atoms to have elec-trons in the Ô¨Årst excited state. Figure 7 shows the relative occupancy of the ground andÔ¨Årst excited states,N2/(N1+N2), as a function of temperature.11This result is somewhatpuzzling, however. Recall that the Balmer absorption lines are produced by electrons inhydrogen atoms making an upward transition from then=2 orbital. If, as shown in Exam-ple 1.3, temperatures on the order of 85,000 K are needed to provide electrons in the Ô¨Årstexcited state, then why do the Balmer lines reach their maximum intensity at a much lowertemperature of 9520 K? Clearly, according to Eq. ( 6), at temperatures higher than 9520 Kan even greater proportion of the electrons will be in the Ô¨Årst excited state rather than in theground state. If this is the case, then what is responsible for the diminishing strength of theBalmer lines at higher temperatures?The Saha EquationThe answer lies in also considering the relative number of atomsin different stages ofionization.

However, it may be that the initial and Ô¨Ånal ions are not in the ground state.An average must be taken over the orbital energies to allow for the possible partitioning ofthe atom‚Äôs electrons among its orbitals. This procedure involves calculating thepartitionfunctions,Z, for the initial and Ô¨Ånal atoms. The partition function is simply the weightedsum of the number of ways the atom can arrange its electrons with the same energy, withmore energetic (and therefore less likely) conÔ¨Ågurations receiving less weight from theBoltzmann factor when the sum is taken.

The electron pressure ranges from 0.1Nm‚àí2in the atmospheres of cooler stars to 100 N m‚àí2for hotter stars.Combining the Boltzmann and Saha EquationsWe are now Ô¨Ånally ready to consider the combined effects of the Boltzmann and Sahaequations and how they inÔ¨Çuence the stellar spectra that we observe.Example 1.4.Consider the degree of ionization in a stellar atmosphere that is assumedto be composed of pure hydrogen. Assume for simplicity that the electron pressure is aconstantPe=20 N m‚àí2.The Saha equation ( 9) will be used to calculate the fraction of atoms that are ionized,NII/Ntotal=NII/(NI+NII), as the temperatureTvaries between 5000 K and 25,000 K.However, the partition functionsZIandZIImust be determined Ô¨Årst. A hydrogen ion isjust a proton and so has no degeneracy; thusZII=1. The energy of the Ô¨Årst excited stateof hydrogen isE2‚àíE1=10.2 eV above the ground state energy. Because 10.2 eV‚â´kTfor the temperature regime under consideration, the Boltzmann factore‚àí(E2‚àíE1)/kT‚â™1.Nearly all of the H I atoms are therefore in the ground state (recall the previous example),so Eq. ( 7) for the partition function simpliÔ¨Åes toZI‚âÉg1=2(1)2=2.Inserting these values into the Saha equation withœáI=13.6 eV gives the ratio of ionizedto neutral hydrogen,NII/NI. This ratio is then used to Ô¨Ånd the fraction of ionized hydrogen,NII/Ntotal, by writingNIINtotal=NIINI+NII=NII/NI1+NII/NI;the results are displayed in Fig. 8. This Ô¨Ågure shows that whenT=5000 K, essentiallynone of the hydrogen atoms are ionized. At about 8300 K, 5% of the atoms have becomeionized. Half of the hydrogen is ionized at a temperature of 9600 K, and whenThas risen to11,300 K, all but 5% of the hydrogen is in the form of H II. Thus the ionization of hydrogentakes place within a temperature interval of approximately 3000 K. This range of tempera-tures is quite limited compared to the temperatures of tens of millions of degrees routinelyencountered inside stars. The narrow region inside a star where hydrogen is partially ion-ized is called a hydrogenpartial ionization zoneand has a characteristic temperature ofapproximately 10,000 K for a wide range of stellar parameters.Now we can see why the Balmer lines are observed to attain their maximum intensity ata temperature of 9520 K, instead of at the much higher characteristic temperatures (on theorder of 85,000 K) required to excite electrons to then=2 energy level of hydrogen. Thestrength of the Balmer lines depends onN2/Ntotal, the fraction ofallhydrogen atoms thatare in the Ô¨Årst excited state. This is found by combining the results of the Boltzmann andSaha equations. Because virtually all of the neutral hydrogen atoms are in either the groundstate or the Ô¨Årst excited state, we can employ the approximationN1+N2‚âÉNIand writeN2Ntotal=/parenleftbiggN2N1+N2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggNINtotal/parenrightbigg=/parenleftbiggN2/N11+N2/N1/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg11+NII/NI/parenrightbigg.continuedThe Classification of Stellar Spectra

Balmer absorption lines are produced only when the electron is initiallyin the Ô¨Årst excited state, as shown in (b). In (c), the atom has been ionized.Of course, stellar atmospheres are not composed of pure hydrogen, and the results ob-tained in Example 1.4 depended on an appropriate value for the electron pressure. Instellar atmospheres, there is typically one helium atom for every ten hydrogen atoms. Thepresence of ionized helium provides more electrons with which the hydrogen ions can re-combine. Thus, when helium is added, it takes ahighertemperature to achieve the samedegree of hydrogen ionization.It should also be emphasized that the Saha equation can be applied only to a gas inther-modynamic equilibrium,s ot h a tt h eM a x w e l l ‚Äì B o l t z m a n nv e l o c i t yd i s t r i b u t i o ni so b e y e d .Furthermore, the density of the gas must not be too great (less than roughly 1 kg m‚àí3forstellar material), or the presence of neighboring ions will distort an atom‚Äôs orbitals andlower its ionization energy.Example 1.5.The Sun‚Äôs ‚Äúsurface‚Äù is a thin layer of the solar atmosphere called thepho-We must compare the number of neutral hydrogen atoms with electrons in the Ô¨Årstexcited state (which produce the Balmer lines) to the number of singly ionized calciumatoms with electrons in the ground state (which produce the Ca II H and K lines).

The ionization energyœáIof Ca I is 6.11 eV , abouthalf of the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen. We will soon see, however, that thissmall difference has a great effect on the ionization state of the atoms. Note that the Sahaequation is very sensitive to the ionization energy becauseœá/kTappears as anexponentandkT‚âà0.5 eV‚â™œá. Thus a difference of several electron volts in the ionization energyproduces a change of many powers ofein the Saha equation.Evaluating the partition functionsZIandZIIfor calcium is a bit more complicated thanfor hydrogen, and the results have been tabulated elsewhere:14ZI=1.32 andZII=2.30.Thus the ratio of ionized to un-ionized calcium is/bracketleftbiggNIINI/bracketrightbiggCa=2kT ZIIPeZI/parenleftbigg2œÄmekTh2/parenrightbigg3/2e‚àíœáI/kT=918.Practically all of the calcium atoms are in the form of Ca II; only one atom out of 900remains neutral. Now we can use the Boltzmann equation to estimate how many of thesecalcium ions are in the ground state, capable of forming the Ca II H and K absorptionlines. The next calculation will consider the K (Œª=393.3 nm) line; the results for the H(Œª=396.8 nm) line are similar. The Ô¨Årst excited state of Ca II isE2‚àíE1=3.12 eV abovethe ground state.

There are 500,000 hydrogen atoms for every calciumatom in the solar photosphere, but only an extremely small fraction, 5.06√ó10‚àí9, of thesehydrogen atoms are un-ionized and in the Ô¨Årst excited state, capable of producing a Balmerline. Multiplying these two factors,(500,000)√ó(5.06√ó10‚àí9)‚âà0.00253=1395,reveals that there are approximately 400 times more Ca II ions with electrons in the groundstate (to produce the Ca II H and K lines) than there are neutral hydrogen atoms withelectrons in the Ô¨Årst excited state (to produce the Balmer lines). The strength of the H andK lines isnotdue to a greater abundance of calcium in the Sun. Rather, the strength of theseCa II lines reÔ¨Çects the sensitive temperature dependence of the atomic states of excitationand ionization.Figure 11 shows how the strength of various spectral lines varies with spectral typeand temperature. As the temperature changes, a smooth variation from one spectral type tothe next occurs, indicating that there are only minor differences in the composition of stars,as inferred from their spectra. The Ô¨Årst person to determine the composition of the stars anddiscover the dominant role of hydrogen in the universe was Cecilia Payne (1900‚Äì1979).Her 1925 Ph.D. thesis, in which she calculated the relative abundances of 18 elements instellar atmospheres, is among the most brilliant ever done in astronomy.2THE HERTZSPRUNG‚ÄìRUSSELL DIAGRAMEarly in the twentieth century, as astronomers accumulated data for an increasingly largesample of stars, they became aware of the wide range of stellar luminosities and absolutemagnitudes.

An Enormous Range in Stellar RadiiIf this idea of stellar cooling were correct, then there should be a relation between a star‚Äôsabsolute magnitude and its spectral type. A Danish engineer and amateur astronomer, EjnarHertzsprung (1873‚Äì1967), analyzed stars whose absolute magnitudes and spectral typeshad been accurately determined. In 1905 he published a paper conÔ¨Årming the expectedcorrelation between these quantities. However, he was puzzled by his discovery that starsof type G or later had a range of magnitudes, despite having the same spectral classiÔ¨Åcation.Hertzsprung termed the brighter starsgiants. This nomenclature was natural, since theStefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law shows thatR=1T2e/radicalbiggL4œÄœÉ.(10)If two stars have the same temperature (as inferred for stars having the same spectral type),then the more luminous star must be larger.1Stellar evolution describes the change in the structure and composition of an individual star as it ages.

hotter than the M stars at the other end. In addition, the empirical mass‚Äìluminosity rela-tion, deduced from the study of binary stars, showed that O stars are more massive than M stars. These regularities led to a theory of stellar evolution16 that described how stars might cool off as they age. This theory (no longer accepted) held that stars begin their lives as young, hot, bright blue O stars. It was suggested that as they age, stars become less massive as they exhaust more and more of their ‚Äúfuel‚Äù and that they then gradually become cooler and fainter until they fade away as old, dim red M stars. Although incorrect, a vestige of this idea remains in the terms early and late spectral types.

Hertzsprung presented his results in tabular form only. Meanwhile, at Princeton Uni-versity, Henry Norris Russell (1877‚Äì1957) independently came to the same conclusions asHertzsprung. Russell used the same term,giant, to describe the luminous stars of late spec-tral type and the termdwarfstars for their dim counterparts. In 1913 Russell published thediagram shown in Fig. 12. It records a star‚Äôs observed properties: absolute magnitude onthe vertical axis (with brightness increasing upward) and spectral type running horizontally(so temperature increases to theleft). This Ô¨Årst ‚ÄúRussell diagram‚Äù shows most of the featuresof its modern successor, theHertzsprung‚ÄìRussell (H‚ÄìR) diagram.17More than 200 starswere plotted, most within a band reaching from the upper left-hand corner, home of the hot,bright O stars, to the lower right-hand corner, where the cool, dim M stars reside. This band,called themain sequence, contains between 80% and 90% of all stars in the H‚ÄìR diagram.In the upper right-hand corner are the giant stars. A singlewhite dwarf, 40 Eridani B, sits atthe lower left.1The vertical bands of stars in Russell‚Äôs diagram are a result of the discreteclassiÔ¨Åcation of spectral types. A more recent version of an observational H‚ÄìR diagram isshown in Fig. 13 with the absolute visual magnitude of each star plotted versus its colorindex and spectral type.Figure 14 shows another version of the H‚ÄìR diagram.

The giant stars occupy theregion above the lower main sequence, with thesupergiants, such as Betelgeuse, in theextreme upper right-hand corner. The white dwarfs (which, despite their name, are oftennot white at all) lie well below the main sequence.The radius of a star can be easily determined from its position on the H‚ÄìR diagram.The Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law in the form of Eq. ( 10) shows that if two stars have thesame surface temperature, but one star is 100 times more luminous than the other, then the17The names of Hertzsprung and Russell were forever joined by another Danish astronomer, Bengt Str√∂mgren(1908‚Äì1987), who suggested that the diagram be named after its two inventors. Str√∂mgren‚Äôs suggestion that starclusters be studied led to a clariÔ¨Åcation of the ideas of stellar evolution.18Russell merely considered this star to be an extremely underluminous binary companion of the star 40 EridaniA; the extraordinary nature of white dwarfs was yet to be discovered. Note that the termdwarfrefers to the starson the main sequence and should not be confused with thewhite dwarfdesignation for stars lying well below themain sequence.Note that Fig. 13 suggests that a correlation exists between color index and spectral type, both of which arereÔ¨Çections of the effective temperature of the star. Recall that color index is closely related to the blackbodyspectrum of a star.2Extremely late and early spectral types are not included in Fig. 14.

If Betelgeuse were located at the Sun‚Äôs position, its surface wouldat times extend past the orbit of Jupiter. The star¬µCephei in the constellation of Cepheus(a king of Ethiopia) is even larger and would swallow Saturn.21The existence of such a simple relation between luminosity and temperature for main-sequence stars is a valuable clue that the position of a star on the main sequence is governedby a single factor. This factor is the star‚Äôsmass.ThemostmassiveOstarslistedinthattableareobservedto have masses of 60 M‚äô,22and the lower end of the main sequence is bounded by M starshaving at least 0.08 M‚äô.2Combining the radii and masses known for main-sequence stars,we can calculate the average density of the stars. The result, perhaps surprising, is that main-sequence stars have roughly the same density as water. Moving up the main sequence, weÔ¨Ånd that the larger, more massive, early-type stars have aloweraverage density.Example 2.1.The Sun, a G2 main-sequence star, has a mass ofM‚äô=1.9891√ó1030kgand a radius ofR‚äô=6.95508√ó108m. Its average density is thusœÅ‚äô=M‚äô43œÄR3‚äô=1410 kg m‚àí3.Sirius, the brightest-appearing star in the sky, is classiÔ¨Åed as an A1 main sequence star witha mass of 2.2 M‚äôand a radius of 1.6 R‚äô. The average density of Sirius isœÅ=2.2M‚äô43œÄ(1.6R‚äô)3=760 kg m‚àí3=0.54œÅ‚äô,which is about 76 percent of the density of water. However, this is enormously densecompared to a giant or supergiant star. The mass of Betelgeuse is estimated to lie between10 and 15 M‚äô; we will adopt 10 M‚äôhere. For illustration, if we take the maximum radius ofthis pulsating star to be about 1000 R‚äô, then the average density of Betelgeuse (at maximumsize) is roughlyœÅ=10 M‚äô43œÄ(1000 R‚äô)3=10‚àí8œÅ‚äô!Thus Betelgeuse is a tenuous, ghostly object‚Äîa hundred thousand times less dense thanthe air we breathe. It is difÔ¨Åcult even to deÔ¨Åne what is meant by the ‚Äúsurface‚Äù of such awraith-like star.21¬µCephei is a pulsating variable like Betelgeuse and has a period of 730 days. One of the reddest stars visiblein the night sky,¬µCephei, is known as theGarnet Star.22Theoretical calculations indicate that main-sequence stars as massive as 90 M‚äômay exist, and recent observationshave been made of a few stars with masses estimated near 100 M‚äô2Stars less massive than 0.08 M‚äôhave insufÔ¨Åcient temperatures in their cores to support signiÔ¨Åcant nuclearburning3

Morgan‚ÄìKeenan Luminosity ClassesHertzsprung wondered whether there might be some difference in the spectra of giantand main-sequence stars of the same spectral type (or same effective temperature). Hefound just such a variation in spectra among the stars cataloged by Antonia Maury. Inher classiÔ¨Åcation scheme she had noted line width variations that she referred to as ac-characteristic. The subtle differences in the relative strengths of spectral lines for stars ofsimilar effective temperatures and different luminosities are depicted in Fig. 15. The workbegun by Hertzsprung and Maury, and further developed by other astronomers, culminatedin the 1943 publication of theAtlas of Stellar Spectraby William W. Morgan (1906‚Äì1994)and Phillip C. Keenan (1908‚Äì2000) of Yerkes Observatory. Their atlas consists of 55 printsof spectra that clearly display the effect of temperature and luminosity on stellar spectra andincludes the criteria for the classiÔ¨Åcation of each spectrum. TheMKK Atlasestablished thetwo-dimensionalMorgan‚ÄìKeenan (M‚ÄìK) system of spectral classiÔ¨Åcation.2Aluminosityclass, designated by a Roman numeral, is appended to a star‚Äôs Harvard spectral type. Thenumeral ‚ÄúI‚Äù (subdivided into classes Ia and Ib) is reserved for the supergiant stars, and ‚ÄúV‚Äùdenotes a main-sequence star. The ratio of the strengths of two closely spaced lines is oftenemployed to place a star in the appropriate luminosity class. In general, for stars of the samespectral type, narrower lines are usually produced by more luminous stars.2The Sun is aG2 V star, and Betelgeuse is classiÔ¨Åed as M2 Ia.2The series of Roman numerals extendsbelow the main sequence; the subdwarfs (class VI or ‚Äúsd‚Äù) reside slightly to the left of themain sequence because they are deÔ¨Åcient in metals. The M‚ÄìK system does not extend tothe white dwarfs, which are classiÔ¨Åed by the letter D. Figure 16 shows the correspondingdivisions on the H‚ÄìR diagram and the locations of a selection of speciÔ¨Åc stars, and Table 3lists the luminosity classes.The two-dimensional M‚ÄìK classiÔ¨Åcation scheme enables astronomers to locate a star‚Äôsposition on the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram basedentirelyon the appearance of its spec-trum. Once the star‚Äôs absolute magnitude,M, has been read from the vertical axis of theH‚ÄìRdiagram,thedistancetothestarcanbecalculatedfromitsapparentmagnitude,md=10(m‚àíM+5)/5,wheredis in units of parsecs. This method of distance determination, calledspectroscopicparallax, is responsible for many of the distances measured for stars,2but its accuracy islimited because there is not a perfect correlation between stellar absolute magnitudes andluminosity classes. The intrinsic scatter of roughly¬±1 magnitude for a speciÔ¨Åc luminosityclass rendersduncertain by a factor of about 101/5=1.6.24Edith Kellman of Yerkes printed the 55 spectra and was a co-author of the atlas; hence the additional ‚ÄúK‚Äù inMKK Atlas.25ecause the atmospheres of more luminous stars are less dense,there are fewercollisions between atoms. Collisions can distort the energies of atomic orbitals, leading to broadening of thespectral lines.26Betelgeuse, a pulsating variable star, is sometimes given the intermediate classiÔ¨Åcation M2 Iab.2Since the technique of parallax is not involved, the termspectroscopic parallaxis a misnomer, although thename does at least imply a distance determination.456

Stellar Atmospheres1The Description of the Radiation Field2Stellar Opacity3Radiative Transfer4The Transfer Equation5The ProÔ¨Åles of Spectral Lines1THE DESCRIPTION OF THE RADIATION FIELDThe light that astronomers receive from a star comes from the star‚Äôs atmosphere, the layersof gas overlying the opaque interior. A Ô¨Çood of photons pours from these layers, releasingthe energy produced by the thermonuclear reactions, gravitational contraction, and coolingin the star‚Äôs center. The temperature, density, and composition of the atmospheric layersfrom which these photons escape determine the features of the star‚Äôs spectrum. To interpretthe observed spectral lines properly, we must describe how light travels through the gas thatmakes up a star.The SpeciÔ¨Åc and Mean IntensitiesFigure 1 shows a ray of light with a wavelength betweenŒªandŒª+dŒªpassing througha surface of areadAat an angleŒ∏into a cone of solid angledœµOmegaŒ±.1The angleŒ∏is measuredfrom the direction perpendicular to the surface, sodAcosŒ∏is the areadAprojected ontoa plane perpendicular to the direction in which the radiation is traveling.

The SpeciÔ¨Åc Energy DensityTo determine how much energy is contained within the radiation Ô¨Åeld, we can use a ‚Äútrap‚Äùconsisting of a small cylinder of lengthdL, open at both ends, with perfectly reÔ¨Çectingwalls inside; see Fig. 2. Light entering the trap at one end travels and (possibly) bouncesback and forth until it exits the other end of the trap. The energy inside the trap is the sameas what would be present at that location if the trap were removed.

Although deÔ¨Åneddifferently, the excitation temperature, the ionization temperature, the kinetic temperature,and the color temperature are the same for the simple case of a gas conÔ¨Åned within an‚Äúideal box.‚Äù The conÔ¨Åned gas particles and blackbody radiation will come into equilibrium,individually and with each other, and can be described by a single well-deÔ¨Åned temperature.In such a steady-state condition, no net Ô¨Çow of energy through the box or between thematter and the radiation occurs. Every process (e.g., the absorption of a photon) occurs atthe same rate as its inverse process (e.g., the emission of a photon). This condition is calledthermodynamic equilibrium.However, a star cannot be in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium. A net outward Ô¨Çowof energy occurs through the star, and the temperature, however it is deÔ¨Åned, varies withlocation. Gas particles and photons at one position in the star may have arrived therefrom other regions, either hotter or cooler (in other words, there is no ‚Äúideal box‚Äù). Thedistribution in particle speeds and photon energies thus reÔ¨Çects a range of temperatures. Asthe gas particles collide with one another and interact with the radiation Ô¨Åeld by absorbingand emitting photons, the description of the processes of excitation and ionization becomesquite complex. However, the idealized case of a single temperature can still be employedif the distance over which the temperature changes signiÔ¨Åcantly is large compared with thedistances traveled by the particles and photons between collisions (theirmean free paths).In this case, referred to aslocal thermodynamic equilibrium(LTE), the particles andphotons cannot escape the local environment and so are effectively conÔ¨Åned to a limitedvolume (an approximated ‚Äúbox‚Äù) of nearly constant temperature.Example 2.1.The photosphere is the surface layer of the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere where theHT‚â°T|dT /dr|=5685 K(5790 K‚àí5580 K)/(25.0 km)=677 km,where the average temperature has been used for the value ofT.How does the temperature scale height of 677 km compare with the average dis-tance traveled by an atom before hitting another atom?

of the solar surface that we observe from Earth. Thus, by the very deÔ¨Ånition of photosphere,the photons must be able to escape freely into space. To say more about the photon meanfree path and the concept of LTE, and to better understand the solar spectrum shown inFig. 5, we must examine the interaction of particles and photons in some detail.The DeÔ¨Ånition of OpacityWe now turn to a consideration of a beam of parallel light rays traveling through a gas. Anyprocess that removes photons from a beam of light will be collectively termedabsorption.I nthis sense then, absorption includes thescatteringof photons (such as Compton scatteringThe change in the intensity,dIŒª, of a ray of wavelengthŒªas it travels through a gas isproportional to its intensity,IŒª, the distance traveled,ds, and the density of the gas,œÅ. Thatis,dIŒª=‚àíŒ∫ŒªœÅIŒªds.(13)The distancesis measured along the path traveled by the beam and increases in the directionthat the beam travels; the minus sign in Eq. ( 13) shows that the intensitydecreaseswithdistance due to the absorption of photons. The quantityŒ∫Œªis called theabsorption coefÔ¨Å-cient,o ropacity, with theŒªsubscript implicitly indicating that the opacity is wavelength-dependent (Œ∫Œªis sometimes referred to as amonochromatic opacity). The opacity is thecross section for absorbing photons of wavelengthŒªper unit mass of stellar material andhas units of m2kg‚àí1. In general, the opacity of a gas is a function of its composition, density,and temperature.11Example 2.2.Consider a beam of light traveling through a gas with initial intensityIŒª,0ats=0.

For pure absorption (with emission processes neglected), there is no way of replenishingthe photons lost from the beam. The intensity declines exponentially, falling by a factorofe‚àí1over a characteristic distance of‚Ñì=1/Œ∫ŒªœÅ. In the solar photosphere where thedensity is approximatelyœÅ=2.1√ó10‚àí4kg m‚àí3, the opacity (at a wavelength of 500 nm)isŒ∫500=0.03 m2kg‚àí1. Thus the characteristic distance traveled by a photon before beingremoved from the beam at this level in the photosphere is‚Ñì=1Œ∫500œÅ=160 km.Recalling Example 2.1, this distance is comparable to the temperature scale heightHT=677 km. This implies that the photospheric photons do not see a constant temperature,and so local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is not strictly valid in the photosphere.The temperature of the regions from which the photons have traveled will be somewhatdifferent from the local kinetic temperature of the gas.Although LTE is a commonly invokedassumption in stellar atmospheres, it must be used with caution.Optical DepthFor scattered photons, the characteristic distance‚Ñìis in fact the mean free path of thephotons. From Eq. ( 12),‚Ñì=1Œ∫ŒªœÅ=1nœÉŒª.BothŒ∫ŒªœÅandnœÉŒªcan be thought of as the fraction of photons scattered per meter of distancetravelled. Note that the mean free path is different for photons of different wavelengths.It is convenient to deÔ¨Åne anoptical depth,œÑŒª, back along a light ray bydœÑŒª=‚àíŒ∫ŒªœÅd s ,(15)wheresis the distance measured along the photon‚Äôs path in its direction of motion (whenobserving the light from a star, we arelooking backalong the path traveled by the photon;see Fig. 7).

( 17) with Eq.

Of course, for pure absorption the intensity of the ray declinesexponentially regardless of its direction of travel through the gas. But we can observe onlythose rays traveling toward us, and this is reÔ¨Çected in our choice ofœÑŒª=0 at the top of theatmosphere. Other choices of whereœÑŒª=0 may be more useful in some situations.IfœÑŒª‚â´1 for a light ray passing through a volume of gas, the gas is said to beopticallythick;i fœÑŒª‚â™1, the gas isoptically thin. Because the optical depth varies with wavelength,a gas may be optically thick at one wavelength and optically thin at another. For exam-ple, Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is optically thin at visible wavelengths (we can see the stars), butoptically thick at X-ray wavelengths.Stellar Atmospheres

whereœÉŒªis the particle‚Äôs cross-sectional area (or effective target area), the photon maybe either absorbed or scattered. In an absorption process, the photon ceases to exist andits energy is given up to the thermal energy of the gas. In a scattering process the photoncontinues on in a different direction. Both absorption and scattering can remove photonsfrom a beam of light, and so contribute to the opacity,Œ∫Œª, of the stellar material. If theopacity varies slowly with wavelength, it determines the star‚Äôs continuous spectrum (orcontinuum). The dark absorption lines superimposed on the continuum are the result of arapid variation in the opacity with wavelengthIn general, there are four primary sources of opacity available for removing stellarphotons from a beam. Each involves a change in the quantum state of an electron, and thetermsboundandfreeare used to describe whether the electron is bound to an atom or ionin its initial and Ô¨Ånal states.1.Bound‚Äìbound transitions(excitations and de-excitations) occur when an electronin an atom or ion makes a transition from one orbital to another. An electron can makean upward transition from a lower- to a higher-energy orbital when a photon of theappropriate energy is absorbed. ThusŒ∫Œª,bb, the bound‚Äìbound opacity, is small exceptat those discrete wavelengths capable of producing an upward atomic transition. ItisŒ∫Œª,bbthat is responsible for forming the absorption lines in stellar spectra. Thereverse process, emission, occurs when the electron makes a downward transitionfrom a higher- to a lower-energy orbital.If an electron absorbs a photon and then returns directly to its initial orbital(where it was before absorbing the photon), then a single photon is emitted in arandom direction. The net result of this absorption‚Äìemission sequence is essentiallya scattered photon. Otherwise, if the electron makes a transition to an orbital otherthan its initial one, the original photon is not recovered and the process is one of trueabsorption. If, while in its excited state, the atom or ion collides with a neighboringparticle, collisional de-excitation may result. When this occurs, the energy lost by theatom or ion becomes a part of the thermal energy of the gas.An important by-product of this absorption process is degrading of the averageenergy of the photons in the radiation Ô¨Åeld. For example, if one photon is absorbedbut two photons are emitted as the electron cascades down to its initial orbital, thenthe average photon energy has been reduced by half. There is no simple equationfor bound‚Äìbound transitions that describes all of the contributions to the opacity byindividual spectral lines.2.Bound‚Äìfree absorption, also known asphotoionization, occurs when an incidentphoton has enough energy to ionize an atom. The resulting free electron can haveany energy, so any photon with a wavelengthŒª‚â§hc/œán, whereœánis the ionizationenergy of thenth orbital, can remove an electron from an atom. ThusŒ∫Œª,bf, thebound‚Äìfree opacity, is one source of the continuum opacity.

ElectronIonPhotonFIGURE 9Free‚Äìfree absorption of a photon.which is comparable to the collision cross section for hydrogen found in Exam-ple 2.1. The inverse process of free‚Äìbound emission occurs when a free electronrecombines with an ion, emitting one or more photons in random directions. As withbound‚Äìbound emission, this also contributes to reducing the average energy of thephotons in the radiation Ô¨Åeld.3.Free‚Äìfree absorptionis a scattering process, shown in Fig. 9, that takes place whena free electron in the vicinity of an ion absorbs a photon, causing the speed of theelectron to increase. In this process the nearby ion is necessary in order to conserveboth energy and momentum. (It is left as an exercise to show that an isolated freeelectron cannot absorb a photon.) Since this mechanism can occur for a continuousrange of wavelengths, free‚Äìfree opacity,Œ∫Œª,ff, is another contributor to the continuumopacity. It may also happen that as it passes near an ion, the electron loses energyby emitting a photon, which causes the electron to slow down. This process of free‚Äìfree emission is also known asbremsstrahlung, which means ‚Äúbraking radiation‚Äù inGerman.4.Electron scatteringis as advertised: A photon is scattered (not absorbed) by a freeelectron through the process ofThomson scattering. In this process, the electron canbe thought of as being made to oscillate in the electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld of the photon.However, because the electron is tiny, it makes a poor target for an incident photon,resulting in a small cross section. The cross section for Thomson scattering has thesame value for photons of all wavelengths:œÉT=16œÄœµ20/parenleftbigge2mec2/parenrightbigg2=6.65√ó10‚àí29m2.(20)This is typically two billion times smaller than the hydrogen cross section for pho-toionization,œÉbf. The small size of the Thomson cross section means that electronscattering is most effective as a source of opacity when the electron density is veryhigh, which requires high temperature. In the atmospheres of the hottest stars (and inthe interiors of all stars), where most of the gas is completely ionized, other sources ofopacity that involve bound electrons are eliminated. In this high-temperature regime,the opacity due to electron scattering,Œ∫es, dominates the continuum opacity.Stellar Atmospheres

Thomson cross section; it is proportional to 1/Œª4and so decreases with increas-ing photon wavelength. Rayleigh scattering can be neglected in most atmospheres,but it is important in the UV for the extended envelopes of supergiant stars, and incool main-sequence stars.13The scattering of photons from small particles is alsoresponsible for the reddening of starlight as it passes through interstellar dust.Example 2.4.The energy of an electron in then=2 orbit of a hydrogen atom is givenbyE2=‚àí13.622eV=‚àí3.40 eV.A photon must have an energy of at leastœá2=3.40 eV to eject this electron from the atom.Thus any photon with a wavelengthŒª‚â§hcœá2=364.7 nmis capable of ionizing a hydrogen atom in the Ô¨Årst excited state (n=2). The opacity ofthe stellar material suddenly increases at wavelengthsŒª‚â§364.7 nm, and the radiative Ô¨Çuxmeasured for the star accordingly decreases. The abrupt drop in the continuous spectrumof a star at this wavelength, called theBalmer jump, is evident in the Sun‚Äôs spectrum(Fig. 5). The size of the Balmer jump in hot stars depends on the fraction of hydrogenatoms that are in the Ô¨Årst excited state. This fraction is determined by the temperature via
continued13Rayleigh scattering is also important in planetary atmospheres and is responsible for Earth‚Äôs blue sky, forinstance.Stellar AtmospheresA photon may also be scattered by an electron that is loosely bound to an atomic  nucleus. This result is called Compton scattering if the photon‚Äôs  wavelength is much smaller than the atom or Rayleigh scattering if the pho-ton‚Äôs wavelength is much larger. In Compton scattering, the change in the wavelength and energy of the scattered photon is very small, so Compton scattering is usually lumped together with Thomson scattering. The cross sec-tion for Rayleigh scattering from a loosely bound electron is smaller than the
the Boltzmann equation, so a measurement of the size of the Balmer jump can be used to determine the temperature of the atmosphere. For cooler or very hot stars with other signiÔ¨Åcant sources of opacity, the analysis is more complicated, but the size of the Balmer jump can still be used as a probe of atmospheric temperatures. The wavelength 364.7 nm is right in the middle of the bandwidth of the ultravi-olet (U) Ô¨Ålter in the UBV system. As a result, the Balmer jump will tend to decrease the amount of light received in the bandwidth of the U Ô¨Ålter and so increase both the ultraviolet magnitude U and the color index (U ‚Äì B) observed for a star.

Since 0.754 eV corresponds to a photon with a wavelength of 1640 nm, any photon with awavelength less than that value can remove an electron from the ion (bound‚Äìfree opacity).At longer wavelengths, H‚àícan also contribute to the opacity through free‚Äìfree absorption.Consequently, H‚àíions are an important source of continuum opacity for stars cooler thanF0. However, the H‚àíions become increasingly ionized at higher temperatures and thereforemake less of a contribution to the continuum opacity. For stars of spectral types B and A,the photoionization of hydrogen atoms and free‚Äìfree absorption are the main sources of thecontinuum opacity. At the even higher temperatures encountered for O stars, the ionizationof atomic hydrogen means that electron scattering becomes more and more important, withthe photoionization of helium also contributing to the opacity.Molecules can survive in cooler stellar atmospheres and contribute to the bound‚Äìboundand bound‚Äìfree opacities; the large number of discrete molecular absorption lines is anefÔ¨Åcient impediment to the Ô¨Çow of photons. Molecules can also be broken apart into theirconstituent atoms by the absorption of photons in the process ofphotodissociation, whichplays an important role in planetary atmospheres.The total opacity is the sum of the opacities due to all of the preceding sources:Œ∫Œª=Œ∫Œª,bb+Œ∫Œª,bf+Œ∫Œª,ff+Œ∫es+Œ∫H‚àí(the H‚àíopacity is explicitly included because of its unique and critical contribution to theopacity in many stellar atmospheres, including our Sun).

Although a variety of different schemes have been developed to compute awavelength-independent opacity, by far the most commonly used is theRosseland meanopacity, often simply referred to as theRosseland mean.15Thisharmonic meangivesthe greatest contribution to the lowest values of opacity.

In certain applications, however, it isnecessary to specify the composition in greater detail.

involved in absorbing and emitting energy must be precisely in balance throughout thestar. In this section, the competition between the absorption and emission processes will bedescribed, Ô¨Årst in qualitative terms and later in more quantitative detail.Photon Emission ProcessesAny process that adds photons to a beam of light will be calledemission. Thus emissionincludes the scattering of photons into the beam, as well as the true emission of photonsby electrons making downward atomic transitions. Each of the four primary sources ofopacity listed in Section 2 has an inverse emission process: bound‚Äìbound and free‚Äìboundemission, free‚Äìfree emission (bremsstrahlung), and electron scattering. The simultaneousand complementary processes of absorption and emission hinder the Ô¨Çow of photons throughthe star by redirecting the paths of the photons and redistributing their energy. Thus in a starthere is not a direct Ô¨Çow of photons streaming toward the surface, carrying energy outwardat the speed of light. Instead, the individual photons travel only temporarily with the beamas they are repeatedly scattered in random directions following their encounters with gasparticles.The Random WalkAs the photons diffuse upward through the stellar material, they follow a haphazard pathcalled arandom walk.

For a large number of randomly directedsteps, the sum of all the cosine terms approaches zero. As a result, for a random walk, thedisplacementdis related to the size of each step,‚Ñì, byd=‚Ñì‚àöN.(29)Thus the transport of energy through a star by radiation may be extremely inefÔ¨Åcient.As a photon follows its tortuous path to the surface of a star, it takes 100 steps to travela distance of 10‚Ñì; 10,000 steps to travel 100‚Ñì; and one million steps to travel 1000‚Ñì.20Because the optical depth at a point is roughly the number of photon mean free paths fromthat point to the surface (as measured along a light ray‚Äôs straight path), Eq. ( 29) impliesthat the distance to the surface isd=œÑŒª‚Ñì=‚Ñì‚àöN. The average number of steps needed fora photon to travel the distancedbefore leaving the surface is thenN=œÑ2Œª,(30)forœÑŒª‚â´1. As might be expected, whenœÑŒª‚âà1, a photon may escape from that level of thestar. A more careful analysis (performed in Section 4) shows that the average level in theatmosphere from which photons of wavelengthŒªescape is at a characteristic optical depthof aboutœÑŒª=2/3.Looking into a star at any angle, we always look back to an opticaldepth of aboutœÑŒª=2/3, as measured straight back along the line of sight.

Recalling the deÔ¨Ånition of optical depth, Eq. (17),œÑŒª=/integraldisplays0Œ∫ŒªœÅd s ,we see that if the opacityŒ∫Œªincreases at some wavelength, then the actual distance back alongthe ray to the level whereœÑŒª=2/3 decreases for that wavelength. One cannot see as far intomurky material, so an observer will not see as deeply into the star at wavelengths where theopacity is greater than average (i.e., greater than the continuum opacity). This implies that ifthe temperature of the stellar atmosphere decreases outward, then these higher regions of theatmosphere will be cooler. As a result, the intensity of the radiation atœÑŒª‚âà2/3 will declinethe most for those wavelengths at which the opacity is greatest, resulting in absorptionlines in the continuous spectrum. Therefore, the temperaturemustdecrease outward for theformation of absorption lines. This is the analog for stellar atmospheres of Kirchhoff‚Äôs lawthat a cool, diffuse gas in front of a source of a continuous spectrum produces dark spectrallines in the continuous spectrum.Limb DarkeningAnother implication of receiving radiation from an optical depth of about two-thirds isshown in Fig. 12. The line of sight of an observer on Earth viewing the Sun is verticallydownward at the center of the Sun‚Äôs disk but makes an increasingly larger angleŒ∏with thevertical near the edge, orlimb, of the Sun. Looking near the limb, the observer will not seeas deeply into the solar atmosphere and will therefore see a lower temperature at an opticaldepth of two-thirds (compared to looking at the center of the disk). As a result, the limb of

the Sun appears darker than its center. Thislimb darkeninghasbeenobservedinthelightcurvesofsomeeclipsingbinaries.Moredetailedinformationonlimbdarkeningmaybefoundlaterinthissection.The Radiation Pressure GradientConsidering the meandering nature of a photon‚Äôs journey to the surface, it may seem sur-prising that the energy from the deep interior of the star ever manages to escape into space.At great depth in the interior of the star, the photon‚Äôs mean free path is only a fraction ofa centimeter. After a few scattering encounters, the photon is traveling in a nearly randomdirection, hundreds of millions of meters from the surface. This situation is analogous tothe motions of air molecules in a closed room. An individual molecule moves about witha speed of nearly 500 m s‚àí1, and it collides with other air molecules several billion timesper second. As a result, the molecules are moving in random directions. Because there is nooverall migration of the molecules in a closed room, a person standing in the room feels nowind. However, opening a window may cause a breeze if a pressure difference is establishedbetween one side of the room and the other. The air in the room responds to this pressuregradient, producing a net Ô¨Çux of molecules toward the area of lower pressure.In a star the same mechanism causes a ‚Äúbreeze‚Äù of photons to move toward the surface ofthe star. Because the temperature in a star decreases outward, the radiation pressure is smallerat greater distances from the center (cf., Eq. 11 for the blackbody radiation pressure). Thisgradient in the radiation pressure produces the slight net movement of photons toward thesurface that carries the radiative Ô¨Çux. As we will discover later in this section, this processis described bydPraddr=‚àíŒ∫œÅcFrad.(31)Thus the transfer of energy by radiation is a subtle process involving the slow upwarddiffusion of randomly walking photons, drifting toward the surface in response to minutedifferences in the radiation pressure. The description of a ‚Äúbeam‚Äù or a ‚Äúray‚Äù of light isonly a convenient Ô¨Åction, used to deÔ¨Åne the direction of motion momentarily shared by thephotons that are continually absorbed and scattered into and out of the beam. Nevertheless,we will continue to use the language of photons traveling in a beam or ray of light, realizingthat a speciÔ¨Åc photon is in the beam for only an instant.4THE TRANSFER EQUATIONIn this section, we will focus on a more thorough examination of the Ô¨Çow of radiationthrough a stellar atmosphere.21We will develop and solve the basic equation of radiativetransfer using several standard assumptions. In addition, we will derive the variation oftemperature with optical depth in a simple model atmosphere before applying it to obtain aquantitative description of limb darkening.2Although the focus of this discussion is on stellar atmospheres, much of the discussion is applicable to otherenvironments as well, such as light traversing an interstellar gas cloud.1Stellar Atmospheres

The Emission CoefÔ¨ÅcientIn the following discussions of beams and light rays, the primary consideration is the netÔ¨Çow of energy in a given direction, not the speciÔ¨Åc path taken by individual photons. First,we will examine the emission process that increases the intensity of a ray of wavelengthŒªas it travels through a gas. The increase in intensitydIŒªis proportional to bothds, thedistance traveled in the direction of the ray, andœÅ, the density of the gas. For pure emission(no absorption of the radiation),dIŒª=jŒªœÅd s ,(32)wherejŒªis theemission coefÔ¨Åcientof the gas. The emission coefÔ¨Åcient, which has unitsof m s‚àí3sr‚àí1, varies with the wavelength of the light.As a beam of light moves through the gas in a star, its speciÔ¨Åc intensity,IŒª, changes asphotons traveling with the beam are removed by absorption or scattering out of the beam,and are replaced by photons emitted from the surrounding stellar material, or scatteredinto the beam. Combining Eq. ( 13) for the decrease in intensity due to the absorption ofradiation with Eq. ( 32) for the increase produced by emission gives the general resultdIŒª=‚àíŒ∫ŒªœÅIŒªds+jŒªœÅd s .(33)The ratio of the rates at which the competing processes of emission and absorption occurdetermines how rapidly the intensity of the beam changes. This is similar to describing theÔ¨Çow of trafÔ¨Åc on an interstate highway. Imagine following a group of cars as they leave LosAngeles, traveling north on I-15. Initially, nearly all of the cars on the road have Californialicense plates. Driving north, the number of cars on the road declines as more individualsexit than enter the highway. Eventually approaching Las Vegas, the number of cars on theroad increases again, but now the surrounding cars bear Nevada license plates. Continuingonward, the trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çuctuates as the license plates eventually change to those of Utah, Idaho,and Montana. Most of the cars have the plates of the state they are in, with a few cars fromneighboring states and even fewer from more distant locales. At any point along the way,the number of cars on the road reÔ¨Çects the local population density. Of course, this is to beexpected; the surrounding area is the source of the trafÔ¨Åc entering the highway, and the rateat which the trafÔ¨Åc changes is determined by the ratio of the number of entering to exitingautomobiles. This ratio determines how rapidly the cars on the road from elsewhere arereplaced by the cars belonging to the local population. Thus the trafÔ¨Åc constantly changes,always tending to resemble the number and types of automobiles driven by the people livingnearby.The Source Function and the Transfer EquationIn a stellar atmosphere or interior, the same considerations describe the competition betweenthe rates at which photons are plucked out of a beam of light by absorption, and introducedinto the beam by emission processes. The ratio of the rates of emission and absorptiondetermines how rapidly the intensity of the beam of light changes and describes the tendencyof the population of photons in the beam to resemble the local source of photons in thesurrounding stellar material. To introduce the ratio of emission to absorption, we divideStellar Atmospheres

Eq. (33) by‚àíŒ∫ŒªœÅd s:‚àí1Œ∫ŒªœÅdIŒªds=IŒª‚àíjŒªŒ∫Œª.The ratio of the emission coefÔ¨Åcient to the absorption coefÔ¨Åcient is called thesource func-tion,SŒª‚â°jŒª/Œ∫Œª. It describes how photons originally traveling with the beam are removedand replaced by photons from the surrounding gas.2The source function,SŒª, has the sameunits as the intensity, W m‚àí3sr‚àí1. Therefore, in terms of the source function,‚àí1Œ∫ŒªœÅdIŒªds=IŒª‚àíSŒª.(34)This is one form of theequation of radiative transfer(usually referred to as thetransferequation).23According to the transfer equation, if the intensity of the light does not vary(so that the left-hand side of the equation is zero), then the intensity is equal to the sourcefunction,IŒª=SŒª. If the intensity of the light isgreaterthan the source function (the right-hand side of the transfer equation is greater than 0), thendIŒª/dsis less than 0, and theintensitydecreaseswith distance. On the other hand, if the intensity islessthan the sourcefunction, the intensityincreaseswith distance. This is merely a mathematical restatementof the tendency of the photons found in the beam to resemble the local source of photonsin the surrounding gas. Thusthe intensity of the light tends to become equal to the localvalue of the source function, although the source function itself may vary too rapidly withdistance for an equality to be attained.The Special Case of Blackbody RadiationThe source function for the special case of blackbody radiation can be found by consideringa box of optically thick gas maintained at a constant temperatureT. The conÔ¨Åned particlesand blackbody radiation are in thermodynamic equilibrium, with no net Ô¨Çow of energythrough the box or between the gas particles and the radiation. With the particles andphotons in equilibrium, individually and with each other, every process of absorption isbalanced by an inverse process of emission. The intensity of the radiation is described bythe Planck function,IŒª=BŒª. Furthermore, because the intensity is constant throughout thebox,dIŒª/ds=0, and soIŒª=SŒª.For the case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the sourcefunction is equal to the Planck function,SŒª=BŒª.As mentioned in Section 2, a star cannot be in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium; thereis a net Ô¨Çow of energy from the center to the surface. Deep in the atmosphere, whereœÑŒª‚â´1as measured along a vertical ray, a random-walking photon will take at leastœÑ2Œªsteps toreach the surface (recall Eq. 30) and so will suffer many scattering events before escapingfrom the star. Thus, at a depth at which the photon mean free path is small compared to the22As a ratio involving the inverse processes of absorption and emission, the source function is less sensitive to thedetailed properties of the stellar material than arejŒªandŒ∫Œªindividually.2It is assumed that the atmosphere is in a steady state, not changing with time. Otherwise, a time-derivative termwould have to be included in the transfer equation.2

The conditions for local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)are satisÔ¨Åed, and so, as already seen, the source function is equal to the Planck function,SŒª=BŒª. Making the assumption of LTE in a problem means settingSŒª=BŒª. However,even in LTE, the intensity of the radiation,IŒª, will not necessarily be equal toBŒªunlessœÑŒª‚â´1. In summary, saying thatIŒª=BŒªis a statement that the radiation Ô¨Åeld is describedby the Planck function, whileSŒª=BŒªdescribes the physical source of the radiation,jŒª/Œ∫Œª,as one that produces blackbody radiation.Example 4.1.To see how the intensity of a light ray tends to become equal to the localvalue of the source function, imagine a beam of light of initial intensityIŒª,0ats=0 enteringa volume of gas of constant density,œÅ, that has aconstantopacity,Œ∫Œª, and aconstantsourcefunction,SŒª. Then it is left as an exercise to show that the transfer equation (Eq. 34) maybe easily solved for the intensity of the light as a function of the distancestraveled into thegas:IŒª(s)=IŒª,0e‚àíŒ∫ŒªœÅs+SŒª(1‚àíe‚àíŒ∫ŒªœÅs).(35)As shown in Fig. 13 for the case ofSŒª=2IŒª,0, this solution describes the transformationof the intensity of the light ray from its initial value ofIŒª,0toSŒª, the value of the sourcefunction. The characteristic distance for this change to occur iss=1/Œ∫ŒªœÅ, which is onephoton mean free path (recall Example 2.2), or one optical depth into the gas.The Assumption of a Plane-Parallel AtmosphereAlthough the transfer equation is the basic tool that describes the passage of light through astar‚Äôs atmosphere, a reader seeing it for the Ô¨Årst time may be prone to despair.

for the net outward Ô¨Çow of energy. And although absorption and emission coefÔ¨Åcients arethe same for light traveling in all directions (implying that the source function is indepen-dent of direction), the absorption and emission coefÔ¨Åcients depend on the temperature anddensity in a rather complicated way.However, if astronomers are to learn anything about the physical conditions in stellaratmospheres, such as temperature or density, they must know where (at what depth) aspectral line is formed. A vast amount of effort has therefore been devoted to solving andunderstanding the implications of the transfer equation, and several powerful techniqueshave been developed that simplify the analysis considerably.We will begin by rewriting Eq. ( 34) in terms of the optical depthœÑŒª, deÔ¨Åned byEq. ( 15), resulting indIŒªdœÑŒª=IŒª‚àíSŒª.(36)Unfortunately, because the optical depth is measured along the path of the light ray, neitherthe optical depth nor the distancesin Eq. ( 34) corresponds to a unique geometric depth inthe atmosphere. Consequently, the optical depth must be replaced by a meaningful measureof position.To Ô¨Ånd a suitable replacement, we introduce the Ô¨Årst of several standard approximations.The atmospheres of stars near the main sequence are physically thin compared with the sizeof the star, analogous to the skin of an onion. The atmosphere‚Äôs radius of curvature is thusmuch larger than its thickness, and we may consider the atmosphere as aplane-parallelslab. As shown in Fig. 14, thez-axis is assumed to be in the vertical direction, withz=0at the top of thisplane-parallel atmosphere.Next, avertical optical depth,œÑŒª,v(z), is deÔ¨Åned asœÑŒª,v(z)‚â°/integraldisplay0zŒ∫ŒªœÅd z .(37)Comparison with Eq.

Therefore, theoptical depth measured along this ray‚Äôs path to the surface,œÑŒª,i sgreaterthan the verticaloptical depth,œÑŒª,v(z). Sincedz=dscosŒ∏, the two optical depths are related byœÑŒª=œÑŒª,vcosŒ∏=œÑŒª,vsecŒ∏.(38)The vertical optical depth is a true vertical coordinate, analogous toz, that increases inthe‚àíz-direction. Its value does not depend on the direction of travel of a light ray, and soit can be used as a meaningful position coordinate in the transfer equation. ReplacingœÑŒªbyœÑŒª,vin Eq. ( 36) results incosŒ∏dIŒªdœÑŒª,v=IŒª‚àíSŒª.(39)This form of the transfer equation is usually employed when dealing with the approximationof a plane-parallel atmosphere.Of course, the value of the vertical optical depth at a levelzis wavelength-dependentbecause of the wavelength-dependent opacity in Eq. ( 37). In order to simplify the follow-ing analysis, and to permit the identiÔ¨Åcation of an atmospheric level with a unique value ofœÑv, the opacity is assumed to beindependent of wavelength(we usually take it to be equalto the Rosseland mean opacity,Œ∫). A model stellar atmosphere, for which the simplifyingassumption is made that the opacity is independent of wavelength, is called agray atmo-sphere, reÔ¨Çecting its indifference to the spectrum of wavelengths. If we writeŒ∫instead ofŒ∫Œªin Eq. ( 37), the vertical optical depth no longer depends on wavelength; we can there-fore writeœÑvinstead ofœÑŒª,vin the transfer equation (Eq. 39). The remaining wavelengthdependencies may be removed by integrating the transfer equation over all wavelengths,usingI=/integraldisplay‚àû0IŒªdŒªandS=/integraldisplay‚àû0SŒªdŒª.With the preceding changes, the transfer equation appropriate for a plane-parallel grayatmosphere iscosŒ∏dIdœÑv=I‚àíS.(40)This equation leads to two particularly useful relations between the various quantitiesdescribing the radiation Ô¨Åeld.

The Eddington ApproximationIf we knew how the radiation pressure varied with temperature for the general case (andnot just for blackbody radiation), we could use Eq. ( 45) to determine the temperaturestructure of our plane-parallel gray atmosphere. We would have toassumea description ofthe angular distribution of the intensity. In an approximation that we owe to the brilliantEnglish physicist Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882‚Äì1944), the intensity of the radiationÔ¨Åeld is assigned one value,Iout,i nt h e+z-direction (outward) and another value,Iin,i nt h e‚àíz-direction (inward); see Fig. 15. BothIoutandIinvary with depth in the atmosphere,and in particular,Iin=0 at the top of the atmosphere, whereœÑv=0. It is left as an exerciseto show that with thisEddington approximation,26the mean intensity, radiative Ô¨Çux, andradiation pressure are given by‚ü®I‚ü©=12(Iout+Iin)(46)Frad=œÄ( Iout‚àíIin)(47)Prad=2œÄ3c(Iout+Iin)=4œÄ3c‚ü®I‚ü©.(48)[Note that because the Ô¨Çux is a constant, Eq.

( 49) becomes4œÄ3‚ü®I‚ü©=Frad/parenleftbiggœÑv+23/parenrightbigg.(50)Of course, we already know that the radiative Ô¨Çux is a constant, given by Eq. ( 43). Usingthis results in an expression for the mean intensity as a function of the vertical optical depth:‚ü®I‚ü©=3œÉ4œÄT4e/parenleftbiggœÑv+23/parenrightbigg.(51)We may now derive the Ô¨Ånal approximation to determine the temperature structure of ourmodel atmosphere. If the atmosphere is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium,another expression for the mean intensity can be found and combined with Eq. ( 51). By thedeÔ¨Ånition of LTE, the source function is equal to the Planck function,SŒª=BŒª. IntegratingBŒªover all wavelengthsshows that for LTE,S=B=œÉT4œÄ,and so, from Eq.

Limb Darkening RevisitedWe now move on to take a closer look at limb darkening (recall Fig. 12). A comparisonof theory and observations of limb darkening can provide valuable information about howthe source function varies with depth in a star‚Äôs atmosphere. To see how this is done, weÔ¨Årst solve the general form of the transfer equation (Eq. 36),dIŒªdœÑŒª=IŒª‚àíSŒª,at least formally, rather than by making assumptions. (The inevitable assumptions will berequired soon enough.) Multiplying both sides bye‚àíœÑŒª, we havedIŒªdœÑŒªe‚àíœÑŒª‚àíIŒªe‚àíœÑŒª=‚àíSŒªe‚àíœÑŒªddœÑŒª(e‚àíœÑŒªIŒª)=‚àíSŒªe‚àíœÑŒªd(e‚àíœÑŒªIŒª)=‚àíSŒªe‚àíœÑŒªdœÑŒª.If we integrate from the initial position of the ray, at optical depthœÑŒª,0whereIŒª=IŒª,0,to the top of the atmosphere, at optical depthœÑŒª=0 whereIŒª=IŒª(0), the result for theemergent intensity at the top of the atmosphere,IŒª(0), isIŒª(0)=IŒª,0e‚àíœÑŒª,0‚àí/integraldisplay0œÑŒª,0SŒªe‚àíœÑŒªdœÑŒª.(54)This equation has a very straightforward interpretation. The emergent intensity on the leftis the sum of two positive contributions. The Ô¨Årst term on the right is the initial intensityof the ray, reduced by the effects of absorption along the path to the surface. The secondterm, also positive,28represents the emission at every point along the path, attenuated bythe absorption between the point of emission and the surface.We now return to the geometry of a plane-parallel atmosphere and the vertical opticaldepth,œÑv. However, we donotassume a gray atmosphere, LTE, or make the Eddingtonapproximation. As shown in Fig. 16, the problem of limb darkening amounts to determin-ing the emergent intensityIŒª(0)as a function of the angleŒ∏. Equation ( 54), the formalsolution to the transfer equation, is easily converted to this situation by using Eq.

Suppose that the source function has the formS=a+bœÑv,(56)whereaandbare wavelength-dependent numbers to be determined. Inserting this intoEq.

By making careful measurements of the variation in the speciÔ¨Åcintensity across the disk of the Sun, the values ofaŒªandbŒªfor the solar source functioncan be determined for a range of wavelengths.

( 52) and ( 53) can be used to determine the mean intensity and thus the sourcefunction:S=‚ü®I‚ü©=œÉT4œÄ=3œÉ4œÄT4e/parenleftbiggœÑv+23/parenrightbigg.Taking the source function to have the form of Eq.

5THE PROFILES OF SPECTRAL LINESWe now have a formidable theoretical arsenal to bring to bear on the analysis of spectrallines. The shape of an individual spectral line contains a wealth of information about theenvironment in which it was formed.Equivalent WidthsFigure 18 shows a graph of the radiant Ô¨Çux,FŒª, as a function of wavelength for a typicalabsorption line. In the Ô¨Ågure,FŒªis expressed as a fraction ofFc, the value of the Ô¨Çuxfrom the continuous spectrum outside the spectral line.

That is,W=/integraldisplayFc‚àíFŒªFcdŒª,(59)where the integral is taken from one side of the line to the other. The equivalent width of aline in the visible spectrum, shaded in Fig. 18, is usually on the order of 0.01 nm. Anothermeasure of the width of a spectral line is the change in wavelength from one side of theline to the other, where its depth(Fc‚àíFŒª)/(Fc‚àíFŒª0)=1/2; this is called thefull widthat half-maximumand will be denoted by(œµDeltaŒ±Œª)1/2.The spectral line shown in Fig. 18 is termedoptically thinbecause there is no wave-length at which the radiant Ô¨Çux has been completely blocked.

Processes That Broaden Spectral LinesThree main processes are responsible for the broadening of spectral lines. Each of thesemechanisms produces its own distinctive line shape orline proÔ¨Åle.1.Natural broadening.Spectral lines cannot be inÔ¨Ånitely sharp, even for motionless,only a brief instant,œµDeltaŒ±t, the orbital‚Äôs energy,E, cannot have a precise value. Thus theuncertainty in the energy,œµDeltaŒ±E, of the orbital is approximatelyœµDeltaŒ±E‚âà/planckover2pi1œµDeltaŒ±t.(The electron‚Äôs lifetime in the ground state may be taken as inÔ¨Ånite, so in that caseœµDeltaŒ±E=0.) Electrons can make transitions from and to anywhere within these ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äùenergy levels, producing an uncertainty in the wavelength of the photon absorbed oremitted in a transition. Using the following equation for the energy of a photon,Ephoton=hc/Œª,weÔ¨Åndthattheuncertaintyinthephoton‚Äôswavelengthhasamagnitudeof roughlyœµDeltaŒ±Œª‚âàŒª22œÄc/parenleftbigg1œµDeltaŒ±ti+1œµDeltaŒ±tf/parenrightbigg,(60)whereœµDeltaŒ±tiis the lifetime of the electron in its initial state andœµDeltaŒ±tfis the lifetime inthe Ô¨Ånal state. (The proof is left as a problem.)Example 5.1.The lifetime of an electron in the Ô¨Årst and second excited states ofhydrogen is aboutœµDeltaŒ±t=10‚àí8s. The natural broadening of the HŒ±line of hydrogen,Œª=656.3 nm, is thenœµDeltaŒ±Œª‚âà4.57√ó10‚àí14m=4.57√ó10‚àí5nm.A more involved calculation shows that the full width at half-maximum of theline proÔ¨Åle for natural broadening is(œµDeltaŒ±Œª)1/2=Œª2œÄc1œµDeltaŒ±t0,(61)Stellar Atmospheresmaterial is greatest at the wavelength  at the line‚Äôs center and decreases moving into the wings.

This resultsin a typical value of(œµDeltaŒ±Œª)1/2‚âÉ2.4√ó10‚àí5nm,in good agreement with the preceding estimate.2.Doppler broadening.In thermal equilibrium, the atoms in a gas, each of massm,are moving randomly about with a distribution of speeds that is described by theMaxwell‚ÄìBoltzmanndistributionfunction,withthemostprobablespeedgiven byvmp=‚àö2kT/m. The wavelengths of the light absorbed or emittedbytheatomsinthegasareDoppler-shiftedaccordingto(nonrelativistic)œµDeltaŒ±Œª/Œª=¬±|vr|/c.ThusthewidthofaspectrallineduetoDopplerbroadeningshouldbe approximatelyœµDeltaŒ±Œª‚âà2Œªc/radicalbigg2kTm.Example 5.2.For hydrogen atoms in the Sun‚Äôs photosphere (T=5777 K), theDoppler broadening of the HŒ±line should be aboutœµDeltaŒ±Œª‚âà0.0427 nm,roughly 1000 times greater than for natural broadening.Amore in-depth analysis, taking into account the different directions of the atoms‚Äômotions with respect to one another and to the line of sight of the observer, showsthat the full width at half-maximum of the line proÔ¨Åle for Doppler broadening is(œµDeltaŒ±Œª)1/2=2Œªc/radicalbigg2kTln 2m.(62)Although the line proÔ¨Åle for Doppler broadening is much wider at half-maximumthan for natural broadening, the line depth for Doppler broadening decreasesexpo-nentiallyas the wavelength moves away from the central wavelengthŒª0. This rapiddecline is due to the high-speed exponential ‚Äútail‚Äù of the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann veloc-ity distribution and is a much faster falloff in strength than for natural broadening.Doppler shifts caused by the large-scale turbulent motion of large masses of gas (asopposed to the random motion of the individual atoms) can also be accommodated byEq. ( 62) if the distribution of turbulent velocities follows the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmanndistribution. In that case,(œµDeltaŒ±Œª)1/2=2Œªc/radicalBigg/parenleftbigg2kTm+v2turb/parenrightbiggln 2,(63)wherevturbis the most probable turbulent speed.

fact, the existence of turbulence in the atmospheres of these stars was Ô¨Årst deducedfrom the inordinately large effect of Doppler broadening on their spectra.Other sources of Doppler broadening involve orderly, coherent mass motions,such as stellar rotation, pulsation, and mass loss. These phenomena can have a sub-stantial effect on the shape and width of the line proÔ¨Åles but cannot be combinedwith the results of Doppler broadening produced by random thermal motions obey-ing the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution.3.Pressure (and collisional) broadening.The orbitals of an atom can be perturbedin a collision with a neutral atom or by a close encounter involving the electric Ô¨Åeldof an ion. The results of individual collisions are calledcollisional broadening, andthe statistical effects of the electric Ô¨Åelds of large numbers of closely passing ionsis termedpressure broadening; however, in the following discussion, both of theseeffects will be collectively referred to as pressure broadening. In either case, the out-come depends on the average time between collisions or encounters with other atomsand ions.Calculating the precise width and shape of a pressure-broadened line is quite com-plicated. Atoms and ions of the same or different elements, as well as free electrons,are involved in these collisions and close encounters. The general shape of the line,however, is like that found for natural broadening, Eq. ( 61), and the line proÔ¨Åleshared by natural and pressure broadening is sometimes referred to as adampingproÔ¨Åle(also known as aLorentz proÔ¨Åle), so named because the shape is characteristicof the spectrum of radiation emitted by an electric charge undergoing damped simpleharmonic motion. The values of the full width at half-maximum for natural and pres-sure broadening usually prove to be comparable, although the pressure proÔ¨Åle can attimes be more than an order of magnitude wider.An estimate of pressure broadening due to collisions with atoms of a single ele-ment can be obtained by taking the value ofœµDeltaŒ±t0in Eq. ( 61) to be the average timebetween collisions. This time is approximately equal to the mean free path betweencollisions divided by the average speed of the atoms. Using Eq. ( 12) for the meanfree path and for the speed, we Ô¨Ånd thatœµDeltaŒ±t0‚âà‚Ñìv=1nœÉ‚àö2kT/m,wheremis the mass of an atom,œÉis its collision cross section, andnis the numberdensity of the atoms. Thus the width of the spectral line due to pressure broadeningis on the order ofœµDeltaŒ±Œª=Œª2c1œÄœµDeltaŒ±t0‚âàŒª2cnœÉœÄ/radicalbigg2kTm.(64)Note that the width of the line is proportional to the number densitynof the atoms.The physical reason for the Morgan‚ÄìKeenan luminosity classes is now clear.

the lower number densities in their extended atmospheres. Pressure broadening (withthe width of the line proÔ¨Åle proportional ton) broadens the lines formed in the denseratmospheres of main-sequence stars, where collisions occur more frequently.Example 5.3.Again, consider the hydrogen atoms in the Sun‚Äôs photosphere,where the temperature is 5777 K and the number density of hydrogen atoms is about1.5√ó1023m‚àí3. Then the pressure broadening of the HŒ±line should be roughlyœµDeltaŒ±Œª‚âà2.36√ó10‚àí5nm,which is comparable to the result for natural broadening found earlier. However, ifthe number density of the atoms in the atmosphere of a star is larger, the line widthwill be larger as well‚Äîmore than an order of magnitude larger in some cases.The Voigt ProÔ¨ÅleThe total line proÔ¨Åle, called aVoigt proÔ¨Åle, is due to the contributions of both the Dopplerand damping proÔ¨Åles. The wider line proÔ¨Åle for Doppler broadening dominates near thecentral wavelengthŒª0. Farther fromŒª0, however, the exponential decrease in the line depthfor Doppler broadening means that there is a transition to a damping proÔ¨Åle in the wings ata distance of about 1.8 times the Doppler value of(œµDeltaŒ±Œª)1/2from the center of the line. Thusline proÔ¨Åles tend to haveDoppler coresanddamping wings.F i g u r e1 9s c h e m a t i c a l l yshows the Doppler and damping line proÔ¨Åles.1.00.50.0DampingDopplerF/H9261/Fc

ofœÑŒª=2/3. The forest of metallic lines (which are already weakened by the low metalabundance of the subdwarfs) appears even weaker against the brighter continuum. Thus,as a result of an under-abundance of metals, the spectrum of a subdwarf appears to be thatof a hotter and brighter star of earlier spectral type with less prominent metal linesThis is why it is more accurate to say that these stars are displaced to theleftofthe main sequence, toward higher temperatures, rather than one magnitude below the mainsequence.The simplest model used for calculating a line proÔ¨Åle assumes that the star‚Äôs photosphereacts as a source of blackbody radiation and that the atoms above the photosphere removephotons from this continuous spectrum to form absorption lines. Although thisSchuster‚ÄìSchwarzschild modelis inconsistent with the idea that photons of wavelengthŒªoriginateat an optical depth ofœÑŒª=2/3, it is still a useful approximation. In order to carry outthe calculation, values for the temperature, density, and composition must be adopted forthe region above the photosphere where the line is formed. The temperature and densitydetermine the importance of Doppler and pressure broadening and are also used in theBoltzmann and Saha equations.The calculation of a spectral line depends not only on the abundance of the elementforming the line but also on the quantum-mechanical details of how atoms absorb photons.LetNbe the number of atoms of a certain element lyingabove a unit areaof the photosphere.Nis acolumn densityand has units of m‚àí2. (In other words, suppose a hollow tube witha cross section of 1 m2was stretched from the observer to the photosphere; the tube wouldthen containNatoms of the speciÔ¨Åed type.) To Ô¨Ånd the number of absorbing atoms per unitarea,Na, that have electrons in the proper orbital for absorbing a photon at the wavelength ofthe spectral line, the temperature and density are used in the Boltzmann and Saha equationsto calculate the atomic states of excitation and ionization. Our goal is to determine the valueofNaby comparing the calculated and observed line proÔ¨Åles.This task is complicated by the fact that not all transitions between atomic orbitals areequally likely. For example, an electron initially in then=2 orbital of hydrogen is aboutÔ¨Åve times more likely to absorb an HŒ±photon and make a transition to then=3 orbitalthan it is to absorb an HŒ≤photon and jump to then=4 orbital. The relative probabilitiesof an electron making a transition from the same initial orbital are given by thef-valuesoroscillator strengthsfor that orbital. For hydrogen,f=0.637 for the HŒ±transition andf=0.119 for HŒ≤. The oscillator strengths may be calculated numerically or measured inthe laboratory, and they are deÔ¨Åned so that thef-values for transitions from the same initial.Stellar AtmospheresConsider the subdwarfs of luminosity class VI or ‚Äúsd,‚Äù which reside to the left of the main sequence The spectra of these subdwarfs show that they are deÔ¨Å-cient in the atoms of metals (elements heavier than helium). Because ionized met-als are an important source of electrons in stellar atmospheres, the electron number density is reduced. Fewer electrons with which ions may recombine means that a higher degree of ionization for all atoms can be achieved at the same temperature. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, this reduces the number of H‚àí ions in the atmosphere by ionizing them, thereby diluting this dominant source of continuum opacity. As a consequence of a low-er opacity, we can see longer distances into these stars before reaching an optical depth.

Thus the oscillator strength isthe effective number of electrons per atom participating in a transition, and so multiplyingthe number of absorbing atoms per unit area by thef-value gives the number of atomslying above each square meter of the photosphere that are actively involved in producinga given spectral line,fNa. Figure 20 shows the V oigt proÔ¨Åles of the K line of Ca II(Œª=393.3 nm) for various values of the number of absorbing calcium ions.The Curve of GrowthThecurve of growthis an important tool that astronomers use to determine the value ofNaand thus the abundances of elements in stellar atmospheres. As seen in Fig. 20, theequivalent width,W, of the line varies withNa. A curve of growth, shown in Fig. 21,is a logarithmic graph of the equivalent width,W, as a function of the number of absorb-ing atoms,Na. To begin with, imagine that a speciÔ¨Åc element is not present in a stellaratmosphere. As some of that element is introduced, a weak absorption line appears thatis initially optically thin. If the number of the absorbing atoms is doubled, twice as muchlight is removed, and the equivalent width of the line is twice as great. SoW‚àùNa, and thecurve of growth is initially linear with lnNa. As the number of absorbing atoms continuesto increase, the center of the line becomes optically thick as the maximum amount of Ô¨Çuxat the line‚Äôs center is absorbed.29With the addition of still more atoms, the line bottomsout and becomes saturated. The wings of the line, which are still optically thin, continue todeepen. This occurs with relatively little change in the line‚Äôs equivalent width and producesa Ô¨Çattening on the curve of growth whereW‚àù‚àölnNa. Increasing the number of absorbingatoms still further increases the width of the pressure-broadening proÔ¨Åle [recall Eq. ( 64)],29The zero Ô¨Çux at the center of the line shown in Fig. 20 is a peculiarity of the Schuster‚ÄìSchwarzschild model.Actually, there is alwayssomeÔ¨Çux received at the central wavelength,Œª0, even for very strong, optically thicklines. As a rule, the Ô¨Çux at any wavelength cannot fall belowFŒª=œÄSŒª(œÑŒª=2/3), the value of the source functionat an optical depth of 2/3.Stellar Atmospheres

The equivalent width grows more rapidly,although not as steeply as at Ô¨Årst, with approximatelyW‚àù‚àöNafor the total line proÔ¨Åle.Using the curve of growth and a measured equivalent width, we can obtain the number ofabsorbing atoms. The Boltzmann and Saha equations are then used to convert this valueinto the total number of atoms of that element lying above the photosphere.To reduce the errors involved in using a single spectral line, it is advantageous to locate,on a single curve of growth, the positions of the equivalent widths of several lines formed bytransitions from the same initial orbital.30This can be accomplished by plotting log10(W/Œª)on the vertical axis and log10[fNa(Œª/500 nm)]on the horizontal axis. This scaling resultsin a general curve of growth that can be used for several lines. Figure 22 shows a generalcurve of growth for the Sun. The use of such a curve of growth is best illustrated by anexample.Example 5.5.We will use Fig. 22 to Ô¨Ånd the number of sodium atoms above eachsquare meter of the Sun‚Äôs photosphere from measurements of the 330.238-nm and 588.997-nm absorption lines of sodium (Table 1). Values ofT=5800 K andPe=1Nm‚àí2wereused for the temperature and electron pressure, respectively, to construct this curve of growthand will be adopted in the calculations that follow.Both of these lines are produced when an electron makes an upward transition from theground state orbital of the neutral Na I atom, and so these lines have the same value ofNa,30This is just one of several possible ways of scaling the curve of growth. The assumptions used to obtain such ascaling are not valid for all broad lines (such as hydrogen) and may lead to inaccurate results.Stellar Atmospheres

If there areNI=1019neutral sodium atoms per square meter, then thenumber of singly ionized atoms,NII, comes from the Saha equation:NIINI=2kT ZIIPeZI/parenleftbigg2œÄmekTh2/parenrightbigg3/2e‚àíœáI/kT.UsingZI=2.4 andZII=1.0 for the partition functions andœáI=5.14 eV for the ionizationenergy of neutral sodium leads toNII/NI=2.43√ó103. There are about 2430 singly ionizedsodium atoms for every neutral sodium atom in the Sun‚Äôs photosphere,31so the total numberof sodium atoms per unit area above the photosphere is aboutN=2430NI=2.43√ó1022m‚àí2.The mass of a sodium atom is 3.82√ó10‚àí26kg, so the mass of sodium atoms above eachsquare meter of the photosphere is roughly 9.3√ó10‚àí4kg m‚àí2. (A more detailed analysisleads to a slightly lower value of 5.4√ó10‚àí4kg m‚àí2.) For comparison, the mass of hydrogenatoms per unit area is about 11 kg m‚àí2.Thus the number of absorbing atoms can be determined by comparing the equivalentwidths measured for different absorption lines produced by atoms or ions initially in the samestate (and so having the same column density in the stellar atmosphere) with a theoreticalcurve of growth. A curve-of-growth analysis can also be applied to lines originating fromatoms or ions in different initial states; then applying the Boltzmann equation to the relativenumbers of atoms and ions in these different states of excitation allows the excitationtemperature to be calculated. Similarly, it is possible to use the Saha equation to Ô¨Ånd eitherthe electron pressure or the ionization temperature (if the other is known) in the atmospherefrom the relative numbers of atoms at various stages of ionization.31The ionization energy for Na II is 47.3 eV . This is sufÔ¨Åciently large to guarantee thatNIII‚â™NII, so higher statesof ionization can be neglected.Stellar AtmospheresTo Ô¨Ånd the total number of sodium atoms, the Boltzmann and Saha equations must be used.

Computer Modeling of Stellar AtmospheresThe ultimate reÔ¨Ånement in the analysis of stellar atmospheres is the construction of amodelatmosphereon a computer. Each atmospheric layer is involved in the formation of lineproÔ¨Åles and contributes to the spectrum observed for the star. All of the ingredients ofthe preceding discussion, plus the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, thermodynamics,statistical and quantum mechanics, and the transport of energy by radiation and convection,are combined with extensive libraries of opacities to calculate how the temperature, pressure,anddensityvarywithdepthbelowthesurface.Thesemodelsnotonlyprovidedetailsregarding line proÔ¨Åles; they also provide information about such fundamental propertiesas the effective temperature and surface gravity of the star. Only when the variables ofthe model have been ‚ÄúÔ¨Åne-tuned‚Äù to obtain good agreement with the observations canastronomers Ô¨Ånally claim to have decoded the vast amount of information carried in thelight from a star.This basic procedure has led astronomers to an understanding of the abundances of theelements in the Sun (see Table 2) and other stars. Hydrogen and helium are by far themost common elements, followed by oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen; for every 1012atomsof hydrogen, there are 1011atoms of helium and about 109atoms of oxygen. These Ô¨Åguresare in very good agreement with abundances obtained from meteorites, giving astronomersTABLE 2The Most Abundant Elements in the Solar Photosphere.

The distinctionbetween the two regions is fairly nebulous. Loosely, the atmosphere is considered to be thatregion where the optical depth is less than unity and the simple approximation of photonsDue to its proximity to us, the star for which we have the greatest amount of observationaldata is our Sun. From ground-based and space-based observatories, we are able to measurewith high precision the composition of our Sun‚Äôs surface; its luminosity, effective temper-ature, radius, magnetic Ô¨Åelds, and rotation rates; the oscillation frequencies (vibrations)throughout its interior; and the rate at which neutrinos are produced via nuclear reactionsin its core. This tremendous wealth of information provides us with rigorous tests of ourunderstanding of the physical processes operating within stellar atmospheres and interiors.The Evolutionary History of the SunBased on its observed luminosity and effective temperature, our Sun is classiÔ¨Åed as atypical main-sequence star of spectral class G2 with a surface composition ofX=0.74,Y=0.24, andZ=0.02 (the mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and metals, respectively).To understand how it has evolved to this point, recall that according to the V ogt‚ÄìRusselltheorem the mass and composition of a star dictate its internal structure. Our Sun hasbeen converting hydrogen to helium via the pp chain during most of its lifetime, therebychanging its composition and its structure.

The Sun‚Äôs effective temperature has also increased from5620 K to its present-day value of 5777 KYou may be wondering what impact this evolution has had on Earth. Interestingly, froma theoretical standpoint it is not at all clear how this change in solar energy output alteredour planet during its history, primarily because of uncertainties in the behavior of theterrestrial environment. Understanding the complex interaction between the Sun and Earthinvolves the detailed calculation of convection in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, as well as the effectsof the atmosphere‚Äôs time-varying composition and the nature of the continually changingreÔ¨Çectivity, oralbedo, of Earth‚Äôs surface.The Present-Day Interior Structure of the SunConsistent with the current age of the Sun, asolar modelmay be constructed for thepresent-day Sun using the physical principles discussed in preceding chapters.

According tothe evolutionary sequence leading to this model, during its lifetime the mass fraction ofhydrogen (X) in the Sun‚Äôs center has decreased from its initial value of 0.71 to 0.34, whilethe central mass fraction of helium (Y) has increased from 0.27 to 0.64. In addition, dueto diffusive settling of elements heavier than hydrogen, the mass fraction of hydrogen nearthe surface has increased by approximately 0.03, while the mass fraction of helium hasdecreased by 0.03.Because of the Sun‚Äôs past evolution, its composition is no longer homogeneous butinstead shows the inÔ¨Çuence of ongoing nucleosynthesis, surface convection, and elementaldiffusion (settling of heavier elements). The composition structure of the Sun is shown inFig. 3 for11H,32He, and42He. Since the Sun‚Äôs primary energy production mechanism isthe pp chain,32He is an intermediate species in the reaction sequence. During the conversionofhydrogentohelium,32Heisproducedandthendestroyedagain.Atthetop of the hydrogen-burning region where the temperature is lower,32He is relatively moreabundant because it is produced more easily than it is destroyed.

Theslight ramp in the11H and42He curves near 0.7R‚äôreÔ¨Çects evolutionary changes in theposition of the base of the surface convection zone, combined with the effects of elementaldiffusion. Within the convection zone, turbulence results in essentially complete mixing anda homogeneous composition. The base of the present-day convection zone is at 0.714 R‚äô.The largest contribution to the energy production in the Sun occurs at approximatelyone-tenth of the solar radius, as can be seen in the Sun‚Äôs interior luminosity proÔ¨Åle and thecurve of its derivative with respect to radius (Fig. 5). If this result seems unexpected,consider that the mass conservation equation,dMrdr=4œÄr2œÅ,givesdMr=4œÄr2œÅd r=œÅd V,(1)indicating that the amount of mass within a certain radius interval increases with radiussimply because the volume of a spherical shell,dV=4œÄr2dr, increases withrfor a Ô¨Åxedchoice ofdr. Of course, the mass contained in the shell also depends on the density ofthe gas. Consequently, even if the amount of energy liberated per kilogram of material (œµ)decreases steadily from the center outward, the largest contribution to the total luminositywill occur, not at the center, but in a shell that contains a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of mass. Inthe case of the middle-aged Sun, the decrease in the amount of available hydrogen fuel atits center will also inÔ¨Çuence the location of the peak in the energy production region.The Sun

Thesolar neutrino problemwas Ô¨Årst noticed when Raymond Davisbegan measuring the neutrino Ô¨Çux from the Sun in 1970 using a detector located almostone mile below ground in the Homestake Gold Mine in Lead, South Dakota (Fig. 8).Because of the very low cross section of neutrino interactions with other matter, neutrinoscan easily travel completely through Earth while other particles originating from spacecannot.As a result, the underground detector was assured of measuring what it was designedto measure‚Äîneutrinos created eight minutes earlier in the solar core.The Davis neutrino detector contained 615,000 kg of cleaning Ô¨Çuid, C2Cl4(tetra-chlorethylene) in a volume of 377,000 liters (100,000 gallons). One isotope of chlorine(3717Cl) is capable of interacting with neutrinos of sufÔ¨Åcient energy to produce a radioactiveisotope of argon that has a half-life of 35 days,3717Cl+ŒΩe/harpoonleftright3718Ar+e‚àí.The threshold energy for this reaction, 0.814 MeV , is less than the energies of the neutrinosproduced in every step of the pp chain except the crucial Ô¨Årst one,11H+11H‚Üí21H+e++ŒΩe.

The complex calculation was based on the rate of neutrino production by85Bdecay in the PP III chain as computed from the solar model, combined with the probabilitythat a solar neutrino will interact with a chlorine atom in the Homestake experiment.Once every few months Davis and his collaborators carefully purged the accumulatedargon from the tank and determined the number of argon atoms produced. The capturerate was measured in terms of thesolar neutrino unit, or SNU (1 SNU‚â°10‚àí36reactionsper target atom per second). With approximately 2.2√ó1030atoms of3717Cl atoms in thetank, if only one argon atom was produced each day, this rate would have corresponded to5.35 SNU.Results of 108 extractions from the Davis experiment between 1970 and 1994 are shownin Fig. 9. Bahcall predicted that the experiment should have yielded a capture rate of7.9 SNU while the actual data gave an average of 2.56¬±0.16 SNU; only one argon atomwas produced every two days in that 100,000 gallon tank!Other neutrino experiments, fundamentally different from the3717Cl experiment, haveconÔ¨Årmed the discrepancy between the prediction of the solar model and observed neu-trino counts.

solar model, including nuclear reaction rates, the opacity of stellar material, the evolutionof the Sun up to its present state, variations in the composition of the solar interior, andseveral exotic suggestions (includingdark matterin the Sun‚Äôs core). However, none of thesesuggested solutions was able to satisfy all of the observational constraints simultaneously,particularly neutrino counts and solar oscillation frequencies.An elegant solution to the solar neutrino problem proposed that the solar model is essen-tially correct but that the neutrinos produced in the Sun‚Äôs core actually change before theyreach Earth. TheMikheyev‚ÄìSmirnov‚ÄìWolfenstein(orMSW)effectinvolves the trans-formation of neutrinos from one type to another. This idea is an extension of theelectroweaktheoryof particle physics that combines the electromagnetic theory with the theory of weakinteractions governing some types of radioactive decay. The neutrinos produced in the var-ious branches of the pp chain are all electron neutrinos (ŒΩe); however, two otherÔ¨Çavorsofneutrinos also exist‚Äîthe muon neutrino (ŒΩ¬µ) and the tau neutrino (ŒΩœÑ). The MSW effectsuggests that neutrinos oscillate among Ô¨Çavors, being electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos,and/or tau neutrinos during their passage through the Sun. The neutrino oscillations arecaused by interactions with electrons as the neutrinos travel toward the surface. Becausethe chlorine (Davis), water (Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande), and gallium detectors(SAGE and GALLEX) have different threshold energies and they are sensitive only to theelectron neutrino, their results were determined to be consistent with the MSW theory.One testable consequence of the MSW effect is that if neutrinos oscillate between Ô¨Çavors,they must necessarily have mass. This is because a change of neutrino Ô¨Çavor can occur onlybetween neutrinos having different masses. The required mass difference needed for theMSW solution to the solar neutrino problem is much less than the current experimentallyestablished upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino of approximately 2.2 eV . Eventhough the standard electroweak theory does not predict masses for the neutrinos, manyreasonable extensions of this theory do allow for masses in the right range. These extendedtheories, known asgrand uniÔ¨Åed theories(GUTs), are currently the focus of intenseresearch by high-energy (particle) physicists.ConÔ¨Årmation of neutrino oscillations came in 1998 when Super-Kamiokande was usedto detectatmospheric neutrinosthat are produced when high-energy cosmic rays (chargedparticles from space) collide with Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere. Cosmic rays are capable ofcreating both electron and muon neutrinos, but not tau neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokandegroup was able to determine that the number of muon neutrinos traveling upward afterhaving traversed the diameter of Earth was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced relative to the numbertraveling downward. The difference in numbers is in excellent agreement with the theoryof neutrino mixing (neutrinos oscillating among the three Ô¨Çavors), demonstrating for theÔ¨Årst time that neutrinos are not massless particles.Thus, after several decades of study, the solar neutrino problem was resolved by aprofound advance in our understanding of particle physics and the nature of the fundamentalforces.As a result of their contributions to this important scientiÔ¨Åc detective story, RaymondDavis and Masatoshi Koshiba, director of the Kamiokande research group that conÔ¨Årmedthe neutrino detections, were two of the recipients of the 2002 Nobel Prize in physics.The third recipient of the 2002 Nobel Prize, Riccardo Giacconi, used a rocket experiment to detect X-rays inspace. Giacconi later designed the Uhuru and Einstein X-ray observatories and also served as the Ô¨Årst director ofthe Space Telescope Science Institute.66The Sun

In 2004, John Bahcall wrote of the efforts to solve the solar neutrino problem:I am astonished when I look back on what has been accomplished in the Ô¨Åeldof solar neutrino research over the past four decades. Working together, aninternational community of thousands of physicists, chemists, astronomers,and engineers has shown that counting radioactive atoms in a swimming poolfull of cleaning Ô¨Çuid in a deep mine on Earth can tell us important things aboutthe center of the Sun and about the properties of exotic fundamental particlescalled neutrinos. If I had not lived through the solar neutrino saga, I would nothave believed it was possible.2THE SOLAR ATMOSPHEREWhen we observe the Sun visually, it appears as though there is a very abrupt and clearedge to this hot, gaseous ball (Fig. 11). Of course, an actual ‚Äúsurface‚Äù does not exist;rather, what we are seeing is a region where the solar atmosphere isoptically thinandphotons originating from that level travel unimpeded through space. Even this region is notclearly deÔ¨Åned, however, since some photons can always escape when the optical depth issomewhat greater than unity while others may be absorbed when the optical depth is lessthan unity, but the odds of a photon leaving the solar atmosphere diminish rapidly as theoptical depth increases. Consequently, the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere changes from being opticallythin to optically thick in only about 600 km. This relatively small distance (about 0.09% ofthe Sun‚Äôs radius) is what gives the ‚Äúedge‚Äù of the Sun its sharp appearance.The PhotosphereThe region where the observed optical photons originate is known as the solarphotosphere.DeÔ¨Åning the base of the photosphere is somewhat arbitrary since some photons can originatefrom an optical depth signiÔ¨Åcantly greater than unity. For instance, if 1% of the photonsoriginating from a layer reach us, the optical depth would be approximately 4.5 at that level(e‚àí4.5‚àº0.01); if 0.1% reach us, the optical depth would be about 6.9. Of course, since theopacity and optical depth are wavelength dependent, the base of the photosphere is alsowavelength dependent if it is deÔ¨Åned in terms of the optical depth. Given the arbitrarinessof the deÔ¨Ånition, the base of the photosphere for the Sun is sometimes simply deÔ¨Åned to be100 km below the level where the optical depth at a wavelength of 500 nm is unity. At thisdepth,œÑ500‚âÉ23.6 and the temperature is approximately 9400 K.Moving upward through the solar photosphere, the temperature of the gas decreasesfrom its base value to a minimum of 4400 K about 525 km above theœÑ500=1 level. It isthis temperature minimum that deÔ¨Ånes the top of the photosphere. Above this point, thetemperature begins to rise again. The approximate thicknesses of the various componentsof the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere to be discussed in this section are depicted in Fig. 12.n average the solar Ô¨Çux is emitted from an optical depthofœÑ=2/3 (the Eddington approximation). This leads to the identiÔ¨Åcation of the effectivetemperature with the temperature of the gas at this depth, orTe=TœÑ=2/3=5777 K.‚ÄúSolving the Mystery of the Missing Neutrinos,‚Äù John N.

only about one in 107hydrogen atoms actually forms an H‚àíion. The importance of H‚àíinthe Sun is due to the fact that even though the abundance of the ion is quite low, neutralhydrogen is not capable of contributing signiÔ¨Åcantly to the continuum.Of course, optical depth is a function not only of the distance that a photon must traveltothesurfaceoftheSun,butalsoofthewavelength-dependentopacityofthesolarmaterial.Consequently, photons can originate from or be absorbed at different physicaldepths in the atmosphere, depending upon their wavelengths. Since a spectral line is notAbsorption lines, including Fraunhofer lines, are produced in the photosphere.According to Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws, the absorption lines must be produced where thegas is cooler than the bulk of the continuum-forming region. Line formation must alsooccur between the observer and the region where much of the continuum is produced. Inreality, the Fraunhofer lines are formed in the same layers where H‚àíproduces the contin-uum. However, the darkest part of the line (its center) originates from regions higher in thephotosphere, where the gas is cooler. This is because the opacity is greatest in the centerof the line, making it more difÔ¨Åcult to see deeper into the photosphere. Moving away fromthe central wavelength toward the wing of the line implies that absorption is occurring atprogressively deeper levels. At wavelengths sufÔ¨Åciently far from the central peak, the edgeof the line merges with the continuum being produced at the base of the photosphere. ThiseffectisillustratedinFig.13.

Solar GranulationWhen the base of the photosphere is observed (see Fig. 14), it appears as a patchwork ofbright and dark regions that are constantly changing, with individual regions appearing andthen disappearing. With a spatial extent of roughly 700 km, the characteristic lifetime forone of these regions is Ô¨Åve to ten minutes. This patchwork structure is known asgranulationand is the top of the convection zone protruding into the base of the photosphere.Figure 15 shows a high-resolution spectrum of solar granulation spanning a numberof convection cells. The appearance of wiggles in the absorption lines occurs because somepartsoftheregionareDopplerblueshiftedwhileothersareredshifted.

Thus the brightcells are the vertically rising hot convective bubbles carrying energy from the solar interior.When those bubbles reach the optically thin photosphere, the energy is released via photonsand the resulting cooler, darker gas sinks back into the interior. The lifetime of a typicalgranule is the amount of time needed for a convective eddy to rise and fall the distance ofone mixing length. Solar granulation provides us with a visual veriÔ¨Åcation of the results ofthe stellar structure equations applied to our Sun.Differential RotationPhotospheric absorption lines may also be used to measure the rotation rate of the Sun.By measuring Doppler shifts at the solar limb, we Ô¨Ånd that the Sun rotatesdifferentially(i.e., the rate of rotation depends on the latitude being observed). At the equator the rotationperiod is approximately 25 days, increasing to 36 days at the poles.Observations of solar oscillations have revealed that the Sun‚Äôs rotation also varies withradius; see Fig. 16. Near the base of the convection zone, the differing rotation rateswith latitude converge in a region known as thetachocline. The strong shear that is setup in this region is believed to result in electric currents in the highly conducting plasma,which in turn generate the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld. Thus the tachocline is probably the sourceof the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld.

Analysis of the lightproduced in the chromosphere indicates that the gas density drops by more than a factor of104and that the temperature begins toincreasewith increasing altitude, from 4400 K toabout 10,000 K.Reference to the Boltzmann and Saha equationsshows thatlinesthatarenotproducedatthelowertemperaturesandhigherdensitiesofthephotospherecanformintheenvironmentofthechromosphere.Forinstance,alongwiththehydrogenBalmerlines,thelinesofHeII,FeII,SiII,CrII,andCaII(inparticular,theCaIIHandKlines,396.8nmand393.3nm,respectively)canappearinthespectrum.Although certain Fraunhofer lines appear as absorption lines in the visible and nearultraviolet portions of the spectrum, others begin to appear as emission lines at shorter (andmuch longer) wavelengths. Again Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws offer an explanation, suggesting thata hot, low-density gas must be responsible. Because the interior of the Sun is opticallythick below the base of the photosphere, the area of emission line production must occurelsewhere. With the peak of the blackbody spectrum near 500 nm, the strength of thecontinuumdecreasesrapidlyatshorterandlongerwavelengths.Asaresult,emissionlinesproducedoutsideofthevisibleportionofthespectrumarenotoverwhelmedbytheblackbodyradiation.Visible wavelength emission lines are not normally seen against the bright solar disk, butthey can be observed near the limb of the Sun for a few seconds at the beginning and endof a total eclipse of the Sun; this phenomenon is referred to as aÔ¨Çash spectrum. Duringthis period, the portion of the Sun that is still visible takes on a reddish hue because of thedominance of the Balmer HŒ±emission line, a line that is normally observed only as anabsorption line in the Sun‚Äôs atmosphere.Using Ô¨Ålters that restrict observations to the wavelengths of the emission lines producedin the chromosphere (particularly HŒ±), it is possible to see a great deal of structure in thisportion of the atmosphere.Supergranulationbecomes evident on scales of 30,000 km,showing the continued effects of the underlying convection zone. Doppler studies againreveal convective velocities on the order of 0.4k ms‚àí1, with gas rising in the centers ofthe supergranules and sinking at their edges. Also present are vertical Ô¨Ålaments of gas,known asspicules, extending upward from the chromosphere for 10,000 km (Fig. 17).An individual spicule may have a lifetime of only 15 minutes, but at any given momentspicules cover several percent of the surface of the Sun. Doppler studies show that massmotions are present in spicules, with material moving outward at approximately 15 km s‚àí1.The Transition RegionAbove the chromosphere, the temperature rises very rapidly within approximately 100 km(see Fig. 18), reaching more than 105K before the temperature gradient Ô¨Çattens some-what.

Forbidden transitions occur from atomic energy levels that are metastable; electrons do not readily make transitions from metastable states to lower energy states without assist-ance. Whereas allowed transitions occur on timescales on the order of s, spontane-ous forbidden transitions may require one second or longer. In gases at higher densities, electrons are able to escape from metastable states through collisions with other atoms or ions, but in the corona these collisions are rare. Consequently, given enough time, some electrons will be able to make spontaneous transitions from metastable states to lower energy states, accompanied by the emission of photons.10‚àí8

Albers.)Since the blackbody continuum emission from the Sun decreases likeŒª‚àí2for sufÔ¨Åciently
Photospheric emissions are negligible in the X-ray wavelength range as well. In thiscase the blackbody continuum decreases very rapidly, dropping off likeŒª‚àí5e‚àíhc/ŒªkT. Con-sequently, any emission in X-ray wavelengths from the corona will completely overwhelmthe output from the photosphere. In fact, because of the high temperatures of the corona, itsX-ray spectrum is very rich in emission lines. This is due to the high degree of ionizationthat exists for all of the elements present, together with the ability of the corona to excitea large number of atomic transitions. Given the many electrons that are present in heavyelements such as iron and the vast number of available energy levels, each such elementis capable of producing an extensive emission spectrum. Figure 21 shows a section ofthe X-ray emission spectrum of the solor corona. It displays a sample of the lines that areobserved in one portion of the X-ray wavelength band, along with the ions responsible fortheir production.The Sun
long wavelengths, the amount of photospheric radio emission is negligible. The solar co-rona, however, is a source of radio-wavelength radiation that is not associated with the blackbody continuum. Some radio emission arises from free‚Äìfree transitions of electrons that pass near atoms and ions. During these close encounters, photons may be emitted as the electrons‚Äô energies are decreased slightly. From the conservation of energy, the greater the change in the energy of an electron, the more energetic the resulting photon and the shorter its wavelength. Clearly, the closer an electron comes to an ion, the more likely it is that the electron‚Äôs energy will change appreciably. Since more frequent and closer en-counters are expected if the number density is larger, shorter-wavelength radio emissions should be observed nearer the Sun. Radio wavelengths of 1 to 20 cm are observed from the chromosphere through the lower corona, while longer wavelength radiation originates from the outer corona. It is important to note that synchrotron radiation by relativistic elec-trons also contributes to the observed radio emission from the solar corona.

Astrophys.,24, 215, 1973.)Coronal Holes and the Solar WindAn image of the X-ray Sun is shown in Fig. 22. This fascinating picture indicates that X-ray emission is not uniform. Active (bright and hot) regions exist, along with darker, coolerregions known ascoronal holes. Moreover, even in the coronal holes, localized bright spotsof enhanced X-ray emission appear and disappear on a timescale of several hours. Smallerfeatures are also apparent within the regions of generally bright X-ray emission.The weaker X-ray emission coming from coronal holes is characteristic of the lowerdensities and temperatures that exist in those regions, as compared to the rest of the corona.The explanation for the existence of coronal holes is tied to the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld and thegeneration of thefastsolar wind, a continuous stream of ions and electrons escaping fromthe Sun and moving through interplanetary space at speeds of approximately 750 km s‚àí1.A gusty,slow solar wind, with speeds of roughly one-half those of the fast wind appears tobe produced by streamers in the corona associated with closed magnetic Ô¨Åelds.Just like the magnetic Ô¨Åeld that is produced by a current loop, the magnetic Ô¨Åeld of theSun is generally that of a dipole, at least on a global scale (Fig. 23). Although its valuecan differ signiÔ¨Åcantly in localized regions (as we will see in the next section), the strengthof the Ô¨Åeld is typically a few times 10‚àí4T near the surface. Coronal holes correspondto those parts of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld where the Ô¨Åeld lines areopen, while the X-ray brightregions are associated withclosedÔ¨Åeld lines; open Ô¨Åeld lines extend out to great distancesfrom the Sun, while closed lines form loops that return to the Sun.The magnetic Ô¨Åeld near the surface of Earth is approximately 6√ó10‚àí5T.8

(From the Yohkoh mission of ISAS, Japan.The X-ray telescope was prepared by the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory, the NationalAstronomical Observatory of Japan, and the University of Tokyo with the support of NASA andISAS.)The Lorentz force equation,F=q(E+v√óB),(2)describing the force exerted on a charged particle of velocityvin an electric Ô¨ÅeldEand amagnetic Ô¨ÅeldBstates that the force due to the magnetic Ô¨Åeld is always mutually perpendic-ular to both the direction of the velocity vector and the Ô¨Åeld (the cross product). Providingthat electric Ô¨Åelds are negligible, charged particles are forced to spiral around magneticÔ¨Åeld lines and cannot actually cross them except by collisions (Fig. 24). This impliesthat closed magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines tend to trap charged particles, not allowing them to escape.In regions of open Ô¨Åeld lines, however, particles can actually follow the lines out awayfrom the Sun. Consequently, the solar wind originates from the regions of open magneticÔ¨Åeld lines, namely the coronal holes. The details observed in the X-ray-bright regions, aswell as the localized bright spots in the coronal holes, are due to the higher densities of theelectrons and ions that are trapped in large and small magnetic Ô¨Åeld loops.The existence of ongoing mass loss from the Sun was deduced long before it was everdetected directly, as evidenced by the tails of comets.

Rather, it isthe electric force between the ions of the solar wind and the ions in the comet that countsfor the direction of the ion tail. This interaction allows momentum to be transferred to thecometary ions, driving them straight away from the Sun.The Sun

Ions that are sufÔ¨Åciently energetic will collide with the atoms in Earth‚Äôs upperatmosphere near the magnetic poles, causing the atmospheric atoms to become excited orionized.

Using rockets and satellites, characteristics of the two solar winds can be measured as theypass near Earth. In addition, the Ulysses spacecraft, placed in a polar orbit around the Sun,was able to detect the wind well out of the plane of Earth‚Äôs orbit. At a distance of 1 AU fromthe Sun, the solar wind velocity ranges from approximately 200 km s‚àí1to 750 km s‚àí1, witha typical density of 7√ó106ions m‚àí3and characteristic kinetic temperatures of 4√ó104Kfor protons and 105K for electrons. Although the winds are composed primarily of protonsand electrons, heavier ions are present as well.Example 2.1.The mass loss rate of the Sun may be estimated from the data givenabove. We know that all of the mass leaving the Sun must also pass through a sphere ofradius 1 AU centered on the Sun; otherwise it would collect at some location in space. Ifwe further assume (for simplicity) that the mass loss rate is spherically symmetric, then theamount of mass crossing a spherical surface of radiusrin an amount of timetis just themass density of the gas multiplied by the volume of the shell of gas that can travel acrossthe sphere during that time interval, ordM=œÅd V=(nmH)(4œÄr2v dt),wherenis the number density of ions (mostly hydrogen),mHis approximately the massof a hydrogen ion,vis the ion velocity, anddV=Adr‚âÉ4œÄr2vdtis the volume of ashell that crosses a spherical surface in an amount of timedt. Dividing both sides bydt,we obtain the mass loss rate,dMdt=4œÄr2nmHv=4œÄr2œÅv.(3)By convention, stellar mass loss rates are generally given insolar masses per yearand sym-bolized byÀôM‚â°dM/dt. Usingv=500 km s‚àí1,r=1 AU, andn=7√ó106protons m‚àí3,we Ô¨Ånd thatÀôM‚äô‚âÉ3√ó10‚àí14M‚äôyr‚àí1.At this rate it would require more than 1013yr before the entire mass of the Sun isdissipated. However, the interior structure of the Sun is changing much more rapidly thanthis, so the effect of the present-day solar wind on the evolution of the Sun is minimal.As an interesting aside, in 1992 bothVoyagers IandIIdetected radio noise at frequenciesof 1.8 to 3.5 kHz originating from the outer reaches of the Solar System. It is believedthat the noise is produced where particles from the solar wind collide with the interstellarmedium, producing a termination shock.The 1992 observations represented the Ô¨Årst detectionof theheliopause, the outer limit of the Sun‚Äôs electromagnetic inÔ¨Çuence. In 2005, whenV oyager I was about 95 AU from Earth and traveling at 3.6 AU per year, it passed throughthe termination shock into the region known as theheliosheath. The strongest evidence thatV oyager I did in fact cross the termination shock comes from the measurement of a suddensigniÔ¨Åcant increase in the strength of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld that is carried by the solar wind.This increased magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is due to the slowing of the solar wind particles andthe resulting increase in particle density.The Sun

The Parker Wind ModelWe now consider how the expansion of the solar corona produces the solar wind. This is aresult of the corona‚Äôs high temperature, together with the high thermal conductivity of theionized gas, referred to as aplasma. The ability of the plasma to conduct heat implies thatthe corona is almost isothermal (recall Fig. 18).In 1958 Eugene Parker developed an approximately isothermal model of the solar windthat has been successful in describing many of its basic features. To see why the solar windisinevitable,beginbyconsideringtheconditionofhydrostaticequilibriu.IfthemassofthecoronaisinsigniÔ¨ÅcantcomparedtothetotalmassoftheSun,thenMr‚âÉM‚äôin that region and the hydrostatic equilibrium equation becomesdPdr=‚àíGM‚äôœÅr2.(4)Next, assuming for simplicity that the gas is completely ionized and composed entirely ofhydrogen, the number density of protons is given byn‚âÉœÅmpsincemp‚âÉmH. From the ideal gas law,the pressure of the gas may be writtenasP=2nkT,where¬µ=1/2 for ionized hydrogen andmH‚âÉmp. Substituting expressions for the pres-sure and density into Eq. (4), the hydrostatic equilibrium equation becomesddr(2nkT)=‚àíGM‚äônmpr2.(5)Making the assumption that the gas is isothermal, Eq. ( 5) can be integrated directlyto give an expression for the number density (and therefore the pressure) as a function ofradius. It is left as an exercise to show thatn(r)=n0e‚àíŒª(1‚àír0/r),(6)whereŒª‚â°GM‚äômp2kT r0andn=n0at some radiusr=r0.

An immediate consequence of Eq. ( 2) is that in our isothermal approximation thepressuredoes notapproach zero asrgoes to inÔ¨Ånity. To estimate the limiting values ofn(r)andP (r), letT=1.5√ó106K andn0=3√ó1013m‚àí3at aboutr0=1.4R‚äô, values typicalof the inner corona. ThenŒª‚âÉ5.5,n(‚àû)‚âÉ1.2√ó1011m‚àí3, andP(‚àû)‚âÉ5√ó10‚àí6Nm‚àí2.However,withtheexceptionoflocalizedcloudsofmaterial,theactualdensitiesandpressuresofinterstellardustandgasaremuchlowerthanthosejustderived.Given the inconsistency that exists between the isothermal, hydrostatic solution to thestructure of the corona and the conditions in interstellar space, at least one of the assump-tions made in the derivation must be incorrect. Although the assumption that the corona isapproximately isothermal is not completely valid, it is roughly consistent with observations.Recall that near Earth (r‚àº215 R‚äô), the solar wind is characterized by temperatures onthe order of 105K, indicating that the temperature of the gas is not decreasing rapidly withdistance. It can be shown that solutions that allow for a realistically varying temperaturestructure still do not eliminate the problem of a predicted gas pressure signiÔ¨Åcantly in excessof the interstellar value. Apparently, it is the assumption that the corona is in hydrostaticequilibrium that is wrong. SinceP(‚àû)greatly exceeds the pressures in interstellar space,material must be expanding outward from the Sun, implying the existence of the solar wind.The Hydrodynamic Nature of the Upper Solar AtmosphereIf we are to develop an understanding of the structure of the solar atmosphere, the simpleapproximation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be replaced by a set ofhydrodynamicequationsthat describe the Ô¨Çow. In particular, when we writed2rdt2=dvdt=dvdrdrdt=vdvdr,œÅvdvdr=‚àídPdr‚àíGMrœÅr2,(7)wherevis the velocity of the Ô¨Çow. With the introduction of a new variable (velocity),another expression that describes the conservation of mass Ô¨Çow across boundaries mustalso be included, speciÔ¨Åcally4œÄr2œÅv=constant,which is just the relationship that was used in Example 2.1 to estimate the Sun‚Äôs massloss rate. This expression immediately implies thatd(œÅvr2)dr=0.At the top of the convection zone, the motion of the hot, rising gas and the return Ô¨Çow ofthe cool gas sets up longitudinal waves (pressure waves) that propagate outward through theThe Sun

The outward Ô¨Çux of wave energy,FE, is governedby the expressionFE=12œÅv2wvs,(8)wherevsis the local sound speed andvwis the velocity amplitude of the oscillatory wavemotion for individual particles being driven about their equilibrium positions by the ‚Äúpiston‚Äùof the convection zone.he sound speed is given byvs=/radicalbigŒ≥ P/œÅ.Since, according to the ideal gas law,P=œÅkT /¬µmH, the sound speed may also be writtenasvs=/radicalBiggŒ≥kT¬µmH‚àù‚àöTfor Ô¨ÅxedŒ≥and¬µ.When the wave is Ô¨Årst generated at the top of the convection zone,vw<vs. However,the density of the gas that these waves travel through decreases signiÔ¨Åcantly with altitude,dropping by four orders of magnitude in approximately 1000 km. If we assume that very littlemechanical energy is lost in moving through the photosphere (i.e., 4œÄr2FEis approximatelyconstant) and thatvsremains essentially unchanged since the temperature varies by onlyabout a factor of two across the photosphere and chromosphere, the rapid decrease in densitymeans thatvwmust increase signiÔ¨Åcantly (approximately two orders of magnitude). As aresult, the wave motion quickly becomessupersonic(vw>vs) as particles in the wave tryto travel through the medium faster than the local speed of sound. The result is that thewave develops into ashock wave, much like the shock waves that produce sonic boomsbehind supersonic aircraft.A shock wave is characterized by a very steep density change over a short distance,called theshock front.Asashockmovesthroughagas,itproducesagreatdealofheating via collisions, leaving the gas behind the shock highly ionized. This heating comesat the expense of the mechanical energy of the shock, and the shock quickly dissipates. Thusthe gas in the chromosphere and above is effectively heated by the mass motions created inthe convection zone.Magnetohydrodynamics and Alfv√©n WavesIt should be noted that our discussion of the hydrodynamic equations has failed to accountfor the inÔ¨Çuence of the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld. It is believed that the temperature structurethroughout the outer solar atmosphere, including the very steeppositivetemperature gra-dient in the transition region, is due at least in part to the presence of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld,coupled with mass motions produced by the convection zone.MagnetohydrodynamicsTThe Sun

(usually mercifully shortened toMHD) is the study of the interactions between magneticÔ¨Åelds and plasmas. Owing to the great complexity of the problem, a complete solution tothe set of MHD equations applied to the outer atmosphere of the Sun does not yet exist.However, some aspects of the solution can be described.The presence of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld allows for the generation of a second kind of wavemotion. These waves may be thought of as transverse waves that propagate along themagnetic Ô¨Åeld lines as a consequence of the restoring force of tension associated with themagnetic Ô¨Åeld lines. To understand the origin of this restoring force, recall that establishing amagnetic Ô¨Åeld (which is always generated by moving electric charges, or currents) requiresthat energy be expended. The energy used to establish the Ô¨Åeld can be thought of as beingstored within the magnetic Ô¨Åeld itself; thus the space containing the magnetic Ô¨Åeld alsocontains a magnetic energy density. The value of the magnetic energy density is given byum=B22¬µ0.(9)If a volumeVof plasma containing a number of magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines is compressed ina direction perpendicular to the lines, the density of Ô¨Åeld lines necessarily increases. Butthe density of Ô¨Åeld lines is just a description of the strength of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld itself,so the energy density of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld also increases during compression. An amountof mechanical work must therefore have been done in compressing the Ô¨Åeld lines in thegas. Since work is given byW=/integraltextPd V, the compression of the plasma must imply theexistence of a magnetic pressure. It can be shown that the magnetic pressure is numericallyequal to the magnetic energy density, orPm=B22¬µ0.(10)When a magnetic Ô¨Åeld line gets displaced by some amount perpendicular to the directionof the line, amagnetic pressure gradientbecomes established; the pressure in the directionof the displacement increases as indicated by an increase in the number density of Ô¨Åeldlines, while at the same time the pressure in the opposite direction decreases. This pressurechange then tends to push the line back again, restoring the original density of Ô¨Åeld lines.This process may be thought of as analogous to the oscillations that occur in a string whena portion of the string is displaced; it is the tension in the string that pulls it back whenit is plucked. The ‚Äútension‚Äù that restores the position of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld line is just themagnetic pressure gradient.As with the traveling motion of a wave on a string, a disturbance in the magnetic Ô¨Åeld linecan also propagate down the line. This transverse MHD wave is called anAlfv√©n wave.1f the electric Ô¨Åeld is negligible, charged particles must spiral around Ô¨Åeld lines. This implies that ifthe charged particles are pushed, they drag the Ô¨Åeld lines with them; the Ô¨Åeld lines are said to be ‚Äúfrozen in‚Äù theplasma.1Alfv√©n waves are named for Hannes Olof G√∂sta Alfv√©n, (1908‚Äì1995), who was awarded the Nobel Prize in1970 for his fundamental studies in magnetohydrodynamics.9

The speed of propagation of the Alfv√©n wave may be estimated by making a comparisonwith the sound speed in a gas. Since the adiabatic sound speed is given byvs=/radicalBiggŒ≥PgœÅ,whereŒ≥is of order unity, by analogy theAlfv√©n speedshould be approximatelyvm‚àº/radicalBiggPmœÅ=B‚àö2¬µ0œÅ.A more careful treatment gives the resultvm=B‚àö¬µ0œÅ.(11)Example 2.2.Using Eq(11), the sound speed and Alfv√©n speed maybecomparedforthephotosphere.Thegaspressureatthetopofthephotosphereisroughly140 N m‚àí2,withadensityof4.9√ó10‚àí6kg m‚àí3.AssuminganidealmonatomicgasforwhichŒ≥=5/3,vs‚âÉ7000 m s‚àí1.pparently, the sound speed is much larger in the Sun‚Äôs interior.Taking a typical surface magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength to be 2√ó10‚àí4T, the magnetic pressureis (from Eq. 10)Pm‚âÉ0.02 N m‚àí2,and the Alfv√©n speed isvm‚âÉ10 m s‚àí1.The magnetic pressure may generally be neglected in photospheric hydrostatic consid-erations since it is smaller than the gas pressure by roughly four orders of magnitude.However, we will see in the next section that much larger magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths can existin localized regions on the Sun‚Äôs surface.Since Alfv√©n waves can propagate along magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines, they may also transportenergy outward. According to Maxwell‚Äôs equations, a time-varying magnetic Ô¨Åeld producesan electric Ô¨Åeld, which in turn creates electrical currents in the highly conductive plasma.This implies that some resistive Joule heating will occur in the ionized gas, causing thetemperature to rise. Thus MHD waves can also contribute to the temperature structure ofthe upper solar atmosphere.AThe Sun

FIGURE 27The Sun‚Äôs rotation creates a spiral pattern in the solar magnetic Ô¨Åeld in interplanetaryspace, known as the Parker spiral. The drag produced by the spiraling magnetic Ô¨Åeld causes angularmomentum to be transferred away from the Sun. This diagram shows the heliospheric current sheetthat separates regions of space where the magnetic Ô¨Åeld points toward or away from the Sun. Theorbits of the planets out to Jupiter are depicted. (Courtesy of Prof. John M. Wilcox and NASA artistWerner Heil.)Because of the Sun‚Äôs rotation, its open magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines are dragged along throughinterplanetary space (Fig. 27). Since the solar wind is forced to move with the Ô¨Åeld lines,a torque is produced that actually slows the Sun‚Äôs rotation. Said another way, the solar windis transferring angular momentum away from the Sun. As a result, the Sun‚Äôs rotation ratewill decrease signiÔ¨Åcantly over its lifetime. Interestingly, the differential rotation present inthe photosphere is not manifested in the corona. Apparently, the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, which sostrongly inÔ¨Çuences the structure of the corona, does not exhibit differential rotation at thisheight.The Outer Atmospheres of Other StarsAlthough this chapter is devoted to our Sun, the most thoroughly studied of all stars, the outeratmospheres of other stars can be investigated as well. For instance, observations indicatethat the rotation rates of solar-type stars seem to decrease with age. Furthermore, late main-sequence stars, with their convective envelopes, generally have much slower rotation ratesthan stars on the upper end of the main sequence. Perhaps winds are transferring angularmomentum away from these lower-mass stars as well.A host of satellites such as EUVE, FUSE, ROSAT, ASCA, XMM-Newton, and the Chan-dra X-Ray Observatory have also provided us with valuable UV and X-ray observations ofother stars. It appears that stars along the main sequence that are cooler than spectral classF have emission lines in the ultraviolet that are similar to those observed coming from theSun‚Äôs chromosphere and transition region. In addition, X-ray observations indicate corona-like emissions. These stars are also those for which stellar structure calculations indicate thatsurface convection zones should exist. Apparently, the same mechanisms that are heatingthe outer atmosphere of our Sun are also in operation in other stars.The Sun

3THE SOLAR CYCLESome of the most fascinating and complex features of the solar atmosphere are transient innature. However, as we will learn in this section, many observational features of the solaratmosphere are also cyclic.SunspotsIt was Galileo who made the Ô¨Årst telescopic observations ofsunspots(recall Fig. 11).Sunspots are even visible occasionally with the unaided eye, but making such observationsisstrongly discouragedbecause of the potential for eye damage.Reliable observations made over the past two centuries indicate that the number ofsunspots is approximately periodic, going from minimum to maximum and back to mini-mum again nearly every 11 years (Fig. 28). The average latitude of sunspot formation isalso periodic, again over an 11-year cycle. A plot of sunspot location as a function of timeis shown in Fig. 29, along with a plot of the percentage of the solar surface covered bysunspots. Because of its wing-like appearance, the top portion of Fig. 29 has come tobe known as thebutterÔ¨Çy diagram. Individual sunspots are short-lived features, typicallysurviving no more than a month or so. During its lifetime, a sunspot will remain at a constantlatitude, although succeeding sunspots tend to form at progressively lower latitudes. As thelast sunspots of one cycle vanish near the Sun‚Äôs equator, a new cycle begins near¬±40‚ó¶(north and south) of the equator. The largest number of spots (sunspot maximum) typicallyoccurs at intermediate latitudes.The key to understanding sunspots lies in their strong magnetic Ô¨Åelds. A typical sunspotis shown in Fig. 30.

The umbra is usually surrounded by a Ô¨Ålament-like structure, called thepenumbra, whose mere appearance suggests the presence of magnetic lines of force. Theexistence of a strong magnetic Ô¨Åeld can be veriÔ¨Åed by observing individual spectral lines
Sunspots are generally located in groups. Typically, a dominant sunspot leads in thedirection of rotation, and one or more sunspots follow. During an 11-year cycle, the leadsunspot will always have the same polarity in one hemisphere‚Äîsay, a north pole in thegeographic northern hemisphere‚Äîwhile the lead sunspot in the other hemisphere will havethe opposite polarity (e.g., a south pole in the geographic southern hemisphere); trailingsunspots have the opposite polarity. Even when a large collection of trailing spots exist,resulting from a tangled magnetic Ô¨Åeld pattern, a basicallybipolarÔ¨Åeld is present. During thenext 11-year cycle, polarities will be reversed; the sunspot with a magnetic south polarity willlead in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere. Accompanyingthis local polarity reversal is a global polarity reversal: the overall dipole Ô¨Åeld of the SunThe Sun
produced within the spot. The strength and polarity of magnetic Ô¨Åelds can be measured by observing the Zeeman effect, the splitting of spectral lines that results from removing the degeneracy inherent in atomic energy levels.The amount of splitting is proportional to the strength of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, whereas the polarization of the light corresponds to the direction of the Ô¨Åeld. Figure 31 shows an example of the splitting of a spectral line measured across a sunspot. Magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths of several tenths of a tesla and greater have been measured in the centers of umbral regions, with Ô¨Åeld strengths decreasing across penumbral regions. Furthermore, polarization measurements indicate that the direction of a typical umbral magnetic Ô¨Åeld is vertical, becoming horizontal across the penumbra.

However, when seen through a Ô¨Ålter dark enough to make viewingthe rest of the 5777-K photosphere comfortable, the sunspot appears dark.T1

For instance, very few sunspots were observedbetween 1645 and 1715; this time interval has come to be called theMaunder minimumThe Sun

(Adapted from a Ô¨Ågure courtesy of J. A. Eddy, High Altitude Observatory.)(see Fig. 33).1Surprisingly, during this period the average temperature in Europe wassigniÔ¨Åcantly lower, consistent with the solar luminosity being a few tenths of a percent lessthan it is today. John Eddy has proposed that there is a very long-term periodicity on whichthe solar cycle is superimposed. This long-period variation goes through grand sunspotmaxima and minima that may last for centuries. Evidence in support of this suggestionis found on Earth in the relative numbers of atmospheric carbon dioxide molecules thatcontain radioactive carbon atoms (146C), as preserved in the 7000-year-long record of treerings. The importance of146C in long-term sunspot studies lies in an inverse correlationbetween sunspots and the amount of146C present in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.146C is a radioactiveisotope of carbon that is produced when extremely energetic charged particles from space,calledcosmic rays, collide with atmospheric nitrogen. Cosmic rays are affected by themagnetic Ô¨Åeld of the Sun, which in turn is affected by solar activity. During the Maunderminimum, the amount of atmospheric146C increased signiÔ¨Åcantly and was incorporated intothe rings of living trees. The amount of146C also seems to correlate well with the advanceand retreat of glaciers over the past 5000 years.
PlagesA variety of other phenomena are also associated with sunspot activity.Plages(from theFrench word forbeach) are chromospheric regions of bright HŒ±emission located near1With the development and continual improvement of the telescope beginning during the early phase of theMaunder minimum (recall that Galileo died in 1642 and Newton was born in the same year), the Maunderminimum was not a manifestation of poor observations.2
2The Sun
With lower temperatures in sunspots, the gas pressure is necessarily lower than in the surrounding material. However, the gravitational force is essentially the same. From these considerations alone, it seems as though the gas within a sunspot ought to sink into the interior of the star, an effect that is not observed. Without the beneÔ¨Åt of a sufÔ¨Åciently large gas pressure gradient to support a sunspot, another component to the pressure must exist. As we have already seen in the last section, a magnetic Ô¨Åeld is accompanied by a pressure term. It is this extra magnetic pressure that provides the support necessary to keep a sun-spot from sinking or being compressed by the surrounding gas pressure.

active sunspots (recall Fig. 17). They usually form before the sunspots appear and usuallydisappear after the sunspots vanish from a particular area. Plages have higher densities thanthe surrounding gas and are products of the magnetic Ô¨Åelds. Apparently the cause of thedecreased brightness of sunspots does not play an important role in plages.Solar FlaresSolar Ô¨Çaresare eruptive events that are known to release from 1017J of energy at thelower detection limit to as much as 1025J of energy over time intervals ranging frommilliseconds to more than an hour.1The physical dimensions of a Ô¨Çare are enormous,with a large Ô¨Çare reaching 100,000 km in length (see Fig. 34a). During an eruption,the hydrogen Balmer line, HŒ±, appears locally in emission rather than in absorption, asis usually the case, implying that photon production occurs above much of the absorbingmaterial. When observed in HŒ±, a Ô¨Çare is often seen on the disk as two ribbons of light(Fig. 34b). Along with HŒ±, other types of electromagnetic radiation are produced thatcan range from kilometer-wavelengthnonthermalradio waves due to synchrotron radiationto very short-wavelength hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission lines.Charged particles are also ejected outward at high speeds, many escaping into interplan-etary space assolar cosmic rays. In the largest Ô¨Çares the ejected charged particles, mostlyprotons and helium nuclei, may reach Earth in 30 minutes, disrupting some communica-tions and posing a very serious threat to any unprotected astronauts. Shock waves are alsogenerated and can occasionally propagate several astronomical units before dissipating.

From the discussion of the previous section, the creation of magneticÔ¨Åelds results in energy being stored in those magneticÔ¨Åelds (Eq. 9). If a magneticÔ¨Åelddisturbance could quickly release the stored energy, aÔ¨Çare might develop. It is left as anexercise to show that both the amount of energy stored in the magneticÔ¨Åeld and the timescaleinvolved in perturbing it via Alfv√©n waves are consistent with the creation of a solarÔ¨Çare.However, details of the energy conversion, such as particle acceleration, are still a matterof active research.A model of a solarÔ¨Çare is illustrated in Fig. 35. The general mechanism of a solarÔ¨Çareinvolves thereconnectionof magneticÔ¨Åeld lines. A disturbance in magneticÔ¨Åeld loops(perhaps due to the Sun‚Äôs convection zone) causes the creation of a sheet of current in thehighly conducting plasma (recall Lenz‚Äôs law). TheÔ¨Ånite resistance in the plasma resultsin Joule heating of the gas, causing temperatures to reach 107K. Particles acceleratedaway from the reconnection point and away from the Sun may escape entirely, producingsolar cosmic rays. Radio-wavelength radiation is generated by the synchrotron process ofcharged particles spiraling around the magneticÔ¨Åeld lines. Soft X-ray emission results fromthe high temperatures in the loop below the acceleration (reconnection) point. HŒ±emissionat the base of the magneticÔ¨Åeld lines (the two HŒ±ribbons) is produced by recombiningThe Sun

electrons and protons that are accelerated away from the reconnection point, toward thechromosphere.In addition, high-energy particles accelerated toward the chromosphere produce hardX-rays and gamma rays due to surface nuclear reactions. Examples of important nuclearreactions associated with solarÔ¨Çares arespallation reactionsthat break heavier nuclei intolighter nuclei, such as11H+168O‚Üí126C‚àó+42He+11H,where C‚àórepresents a carbon nucleus in an excited state, followed by the de-excitationreaction126C‚àó‚Üí126C+Œ≥,withEŒ≥=4.438 MeV, or11H+2010Ne‚Üí168O‚àó+42He+11H,followed by the de-excitation reaction168O‚àó‚Üí168O+Œ≥,withEŒ≥=6.129 MeV. Other examples of reactions produced byÔ¨Çares on the Sun‚Äôs surfaceinclude electron‚Äìpositron annihilation,e‚àí+e+‚ÜíŒ≥+Œ≥whereEŒ≥=0.511 MeV, and the production of deuterium by11H+n‚Üí21H‚àó‚Üí21H+Œ≥,whereEŒ≥=2.223 MeV.Solar ProminencesSolar prominencesare also related to the Sun‚Äôs magneticÔ¨Åeld.Quiescent prominencesare curtains of ionized gas that reach well into the corona and can remain stable for weeksor months. The material in the prominence has collected along the magneticÔ¨Åeld lines ofan active region, with the result that the gas is cooler (with a typical temperature of 8000 K)and more dense than the surrounding coronal gas. This causes the gas to‚Äúrain‚Äùback downinto the chromosphere. When viewed in HŒ±at the limb of the Sun, quiescent prominencesappear as bright structures against the thin corona. However, when viewed in the continuumagainst the solar disk, a quiescent prominence appears as a darkÔ¨Ålament, absorbing thelight emitted from below. An example of a quiescent prominence is shown in Fig. 36(a).Aneruptive(oractive)prominence(Fig. 36b) may exist for only a few hours andmay abruptly develop from a quiescent prominence. It appears as though a relatively stablemagneticÔ¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration can suddenly become unstable, causing the prominence to liftaway from the Sun. Although the mechanism is related to that of a solarÔ¨Çare, the outcomeis somewhat different; rather than most of the energy going into electromagnetic radiation,the energy of an eruptive prominence is converted into mass motions as gas is ejectedfrom the Sun.The Sun

CMEs have been observedsince the early 1970s using spacecraft such as NASA‚Äôs seventh Orbiting Solar Observatory(OSO 7) and Skylab. Most recently, CMEs have been observed routinely by SOHO‚Äôs LargeAngle Spectrometric COronograph (LASCO); see Fig. 37.

The white circle on the occultingdisk represents the size of the Sun out to the photosphere. [SOHO (ESA & NASA)]a few solar radii out to 30 R‚äô. With the detection of thousands of CMEs it appears thatthere is about one CME per day when averaged over the 11-year sunspot cycle. When theSun is more active (i.e., near sunspot maximum) the frequency may be about 3.5 events perday, and during sunspot minimum the number of events may decrease to roughly one everyÔ¨Åve days. During a CME event, between 5√ó1012kg and 5√ó1013kg of material may beejected from the Sun at speeds ranging from 400 km s‚àí1to over 1000 km s‚àí1. CMEs appearto be associated with eruptive prominences approximately 70% of the time, and withÔ¨Çaresonly about 40% of the time. One can think of a CME as a magnetic bubble lifting off ofthe Sun‚Äôs surface after a magnetic reconnection event, carrying a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of themass of the solar corona with it.The Time-Dependent Shape of the CoronaYet another feature of the solar cycle involves the shape of the corona itself. During a periodof little solar activity, when there are few sunspots and few, if any,Ô¨Çares or prominences,thequiet coronais generally more extended at the equator than at the poles, consistentwith a nearly dipole magneticÔ¨Åeld. Near sunspot maximum, theactive coronais morecomplex in shape, as is the structure of the magneticÔ¨Åeld. Examples of the shape of thecorona during sunspot minimum and maximum are seen in Figs. 20(a) and 20(b),respectively. Evidently, the changing shape of the corona, like other solar activity, is due tothe dynamic structure of the Sun‚Äôs magneticÔ¨Åeld.The Sun

The Magnetic Dynamo TheoryAmagnetic dynamomodel describing many of the components of the solar cycle wasÔ¨Årstproposed by Horace Babcock in 1961. Despite its general success in describing the majorfeatures of the solar cycle, the model is not yet able to provide adequate explanations ofmany of the important details of solar activity. Any complete picture of the solar cycle willrequire a full treatment of the MHD equations in the solar environment, including differingrotation rates with latitude and depth in the Sun, convection, solar oscillations, heating ofthe upper atmosphere, and mass loss. Of course, not all of these processes are likely to playequally important roles in the study of the solar cycle, but it is important to understand thedegree to which each of them contributes to the particular phenomenon under investigation.As depicted in Fig. 38, because the magneticÔ¨Åeld lines are‚Äúfrozen into‚Äùthe gas, thedifferential rotation of the Sun drags the lines along, converting apoloidalÔ¨Åeld (essentially

a simple magnetic dipole) to one that has a signiÔ¨Åcanttoroidalcomponent (Ô¨Åeld lines thatare wrapped around the Sun). The turbulent convection zone then has the effect of twistingthe lines, creating regions of intense magneticÔ¨Åelds, called magneticropes. The buoyancyproduced by magnetic pressure (Eq. 10) causes the ropes to rise to the surface, appearingas sunspot groups. The polarity of the sunspots is due to the direction of the magneticÔ¨Åeldalong the ropes; consequently, every lead spot in one hemisphere will have the same polaritywhile the lead spots in the other hemisphere will have the opposite polarity.Initially, the little twisting that does develop occurs at higher latitudes; during sunspotminimum. As the differential rotation continues to drag theÔ¨Åeld lines along and convectiveturbulence ties them in knots, more sunspots develop at intermediate latitudes, producinga sunspot maximum. It would seem that ultimately the greatest amount of twisting and thelargest number of sunspots should develop near the equator. However, sunspots from thetwo hemispheres tend to cancel out near the equator since the polarities of their leadingspots are opposed. As a result, the number of sunspots appearing near the equator is small.Finally, the cancelation of magneticÔ¨Åelds near the equator causes the poloidalÔ¨Åeld tobe reestablished, but with its original polarity reversed. This process takes approximately11 years. The entire procedure repeats continuously, with the polarity of the magneticÔ¨Åeldreturning to its original orientation every other cycle. Hence, the entire solar cycle is actually22 years long when magneticÔ¨Åeld polarities are considered.As we have already seen, details related to speciÔ¨Åc phenomena, such as the cause ofthe decreasedÔ¨Çux coming from sunspots or the exact process ofÔ¨Çare generation, are notyet well understood. The same situation also holds for the more fundamental magneticdynamo itself. Although the preceding discussion describes the behavior of the solar cyclein an approximate way, even such basic results as the timescales involved have not yetbeen accurately modeled. A successful magnetic dynamo model must not only produce thegeneral location and numbers of sunspots andÔ¨Çares, but it must also do so with the observed22-year periodicity. Moreover, the dynamo model must replicate the much slower variationthat appears to be responsible for the Maunder minimum.Evidence of Magnetic Activity in Other StarsFortunately, some evidence does exist that the basic ideas behind the solar cycle are correct.Observations of other cool main-sequence stars indicate that they possess activity cyclesmuch like the solar cycle. It was pointed out in the last section that late main-sequence starsexhibit observational characteristics consistent with the existence of hot coronae. It was alsomentioned that angular momentum is apparently lost via stellar winds. Both phenomenaagree with the theoretical onset of surface convection in low-mass stars, a major componentof the dynamo theory.Other forms of magnetic activity have also been seen in some stars. Observations indicatethe existence ofÔ¨Çare stars, main-sequence stars of class M that demonstrate occasional,rapidÔ¨Çuctuations in brightness. IfÔ¨Çares the size of those on the Sun were to occur on themuch dimmer M stars, theÔ¨Çares would contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly to the total luminosity ofthose stars, producing the short-term changes that are observed. Much largerÔ¨Çares mayalso be generated by other stars as well: On April 24, 2004, the star GJ 3685A released aÔ¨Çare that was roughly one million times more energetic than a large solarÔ¨Çare. The eventwas detected serendipitously by NASA‚Äôs Galaxy Evolution Explorer.The Sun

J.,249, 662, 1981.)Starspotsare also observed to exist on stars other than the Sun. Starspots are revealed bytheir effect on the luminosity of a star, which can be measured at a level of 1%. Two classesof stars, RS Canum Venaticorum and BY Draconis stars,1show signiÔ¨Åcant long-termvariations that are attributed to starspots covering appreciable fractions of their surfaces.For example, Fig. 39 shows a variation of over 0.6 magnitude in the B band for the BYDraconis star, BD+26‚ó¶730. Starspots can even be used to measure stellar rotation.MagneticÔ¨Åelds have also been detected directly on several cool main-sequence stars bymeasuring Zeeman-broadened spectral lines. Analysis of the data indicatesÔ¨Åeld strengthsof several tenths of a tesla over signiÔ¨Åcant fractions of the stellar surfaces. The existence ofthe strongÔ¨Åelds correlates with their observed luminosity variations.From our discussion in this chapter, it should be clear that astrophysics has had a greatdeal of success in explaining many of the features of our Sun. The stellar structure equationsdescribe the major aspects of the solar interior, and much of the Sun‚Äôs complex atmosphereis also understood. But many other important issues remain to be resolved, such as thesurface abundance of lithium, the intricate details of the solar cycle, and the interactionbetween the Sun and Earth‚Äôs climate. Much exciting and challenging work remains to bedone before we can feel conÔ¨Ådent that we fully understand the star that is closest to us.1Classes of stars that show light variations,variable stars, are usually named after theÔ¨Årst star discovered thatexhibits the speciÔ¨Åc characteristics. RS CVn and BY Dra are main-sequence stars of spectral classes F‚ÄìG andK‚ÄìM, respectively. The letters RS and BY indicate that these are variable stars; Canum Venaticorum and Draconisare the constellations in which the stars are located.4

Determining the Internal Structures of StarsTo deduce the detailed internal structure of stars requires the generation of computer modelsthat are consistent with all known physical laws and that ultimately agree with observablesurface features. Although much of the theoretical foundation of stellar structure was un-derstood by the Ô¨Årst half of the twentieth century, it wasn‚Äôt until the 1960s that sufÔ¨Åcientlyfast computing machines became available to carry out all of the necessary calculations.Arguably one of the greatest successes of theoretical astrophysics has been the detailedcomputer modeling of stellar structure and evolution. However, despite all of the successesof such calculations, numerous questions remain unanswered. The solution to many of theseproblems requires a more detailed theoretical understanding of the physical processes inoperation in the interiors of stars, combined with even greater computational power.The theoretical study of stellar structure, coupled with observational data, clearly showsthat stars are dynamic objects, usually changing at an imperceptibly slow rate by humanstandards, although they can sometimes change in very rapid and dramatic ways, suchas during a supernova explosion. That such changes must occur can be seen by simplyconsidering the observed energy output of a star. In the Sun, 3.839√ó1026J of energy isAnalysis of stellar spectra, collected by ground-based and space - based telescopes, ena-bles astronomers to determine a variety of quantities related to the outer layers of stars, such as effective temperature, luminosity, and composition. However, with the exceptions of the ongoing detection of neutrinos from the Sun (which will be discussed later in this chapter and the one-time detection from Supernova 1987A, no direct way exists to observe the central regions of stars.

This rate of energy output would be sufÔ¨Åcient to melt a 0‚ó¶C block ofice measuring 1 AU√ó1 mile√ó1 mile in only 0.3 s, assuming that the absorption of theenergy was 100% efÔ¨Åcient. Because stars do not have inÔ¨Ånite supplies of energy, they musteventually use up their reserves and die.Stellar evolution is the result of a constant Ô¨Åghtagainst the relentless pull of gravity.The Derivation of the Hydrostatic Equilibrium EquationThe gravitational force is always attractive, implying that an opposing force must exist if astar is to avoid collapse. This force is provided by pressure. To calculate how the pressuremust vary with depth, consider a cylinder of massdmwhose base is located a distancerfrom the center of a spherical star (see Fig. 1).

Equation ( 6) clearly indicates that in order for a star to be static, apressuregradientdP/drmust exist to counteract the force of gravity. It is not the pressure thatsupports a star, but the change in pressure with radius. Furthermore, the pressure mustdecreasewith increasing radius; the pressure is necessarily larger in the interior than it isnear the surface.Example 1.1.To obtain a very crude estimate of the pressure at the center of theSun, assume thatMr=1M‚äô,r=1R‚äô, andœÅ=œÅ‚äô=1410 kg m‚àí3is theaveragesolardensityAssumealsothatthesurfacepressureisexactlyzero.Then,convertingthedifferentialequationtoadifferenceequation,thelefthandsideofEq.(6)becomesdPdr‚àºPs‚àíPcRs‚àí0‚àº‚àíPcR‚äô,wherePcis the central pressure, andPsandRsare the surface pressure and radius, respec-tively.

The approach used here will also provide a generalmethod for considering environments where the assumptions of the ideal gas law do notapply, a situation frequently encountered in astrophysical problems.The Derivation of the Pressure IntegralConsider a cylinder of gas of length‚ÑìDelta1xand cross-sectional areaA, as in Fig. 3. Thegas contained in the cylinder is assumed to be composed of point particles, each of massm, that interact through perfectly elastic collisions only‚Äîin other words, as an ideal gas.To determine the pressure exerted on one of the ends of the container, examine the result ofan impact on the right wall by an individual particle. Since, for a perfectly elastic collision,the angle of reÔ¨Çection from the wall must be equal to the angle of incidence, the change inmomentum of the particle is necessarily entirely in thex-direction, normal to the surface.From Newton‚Äôs second law1(f=ma=dp/dt) and third law, theimpulsef‚ÑìDelta1tdeliveredto the wall is just the negative of the change in momentum of the particle, orf‚ÑìDelta1t=‚àí‚ÑìDelta1p=2pxÀÜi,wherepxis the component of the particle‚Äôs initial momentum in thex-direction. Now theaverage force exerted by the particle over a period of time can be determined by evaluatingthe time interval between collisions with the right wall. Since the particle must traversethe length of the container twice before returning for a second reÔ¨Çection, the time intervalbetween collisions with the same wall by the same particle is given by‚ÑìDelta1t=2‚ÑìDelta1xvx,

so that the average force exerted on the wall by a single particle over that time period isgiven byf=2px‚ÑìDelta1t=pxvx‚ÑìDelta1x,where it is assumed that the direction of the force vector is normal to the surface.Now, becausepx‚àùvx, the numerator is proportional tov2x. To evaluate this, recall thatthe magnitude of the velocity vector is given byv2=v2x+v2y+v2z. For a sufÔ¨Åciently largecollection of particles in random motion, the likelihood of motion in each of the threedirections is the same, orv2x=v2y=v2z=v2/3.

The Average Kinetic Energy Per ParticleFurther investigation of the ideal gas law shows that it is also possible to combine Eq.

For instance, in the pressure integral itwas assumed that the upper limit of integration for velocity was inÔ¨Ånity. Of course, thiscannot be the case since, from Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity, the maximum possiblevalue of velocity isc, the speed of light. Furthermore, the effects of quantum mechanicswere also neglected in the derivation of the ideal gas law. When the Heisenberg uncertaintyprinciple and the Pauli exclusion principle are considered, a distribution function differentfrom the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution results. TheFermi‚ÄìDiracdistribution functionconsiders these important principles and leads to a very different pressure equation ofstate when applied to extremely dense matter such as that found in white dwarf stars andneutron stars.Fermi‚ÄìDiracstatisticsare calledfermions.Another statistical distribution function is obtained if it is assumed that the presenceof some particles in a particular state enhances the likelihood of others being in the samestate, an effect somewhat opposite to that of the Pauli exclusion principle.Bose‚ÄìEinsteinstatisticshas a variety of applications, including understanding the behavior of photons.Particles that obey Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics are known asbosons.Just as special relativity and quantum mechanics must give classical results in the appro-priate limits, Fermi‚ÄìDirac and Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics also approach the classical regime at.

However,the problem may also be solved by realizing thatnŒΩdŒΩrepresents the number density ofphotons having frequencies lying in the range betweenŒΩandŒΩ+dŒΩ. Multiplying by theenergy of each photon in that range would then give theenergy densityover the frequencyinterval, orPrad=13‚é©integraldisplay‚àû0uŒΩdŒΩ,(18)whereuŒΩdŒΩ=hŒΩnŒΩdŒΩ.

Based on radioactive dating techniques,however, the estimated age of rocks on the Moon‚Äôs surface is over 4√ó109yr. It seemsunlikely that the age of the Sun is less than the age of the Moon! Therefore, gravitationalpotential energy alone cannot account for the Sun‚Äôs luminosity throughout its entire lifetime.As we shall see in later chapters, however, gravitational energy can play an important roleduring some phases of the evolution of stars.Another possible energy source involves chemical processes. However, since chemicalreactions are based on the interactions of orbital electrons in atoms, the amount of energyavailable to be released per atom is not likely to be more than 1‚Äì10 electron volts, typicalThe Nuclear TimescaleThe nuclei of atoms may also be considered as sources of energy. Whereas electron orbitsinvolve energies in the electron volt (eV) range, nuclear processes generally involve energiesmillions of times larger (MeV). Just as chemical reactions can result in the transformationof atoms into molecules or one kind of molecule into another, nuclear reactions change onetype of nucleus into another.The nucleus of a particularelementis speciÔ¨Åed by the number of protons,Z, it contains(not to be confused with the mass fraction of metals), with each proton carrying a charge of+e. Obviously, in a neutral atom the number of protons must exactly equal the number oforbital electrons. Anisotopeof a given element is identiÔ¨Åed by the number of neutrons,N,in the nucleus, with neutrons being electrically neutral, as the name implies. (All isotopesof a given element have the same number of protons.) Collectively, protons and neutronsare referred to asnucleons, the number of nucleons in a particular isotope beingA=Z+N. Since protons and neutrons have very similar masses and greatly exceed the massof electrons,Ais a good indication of the mass of the isotope and is often referred to as theThe Interiors of Stars

Themasses of nuclear particles are also frequently expressed in terms of their rest mass energies,in units of MeV . Using Einstein‚ÄôsE=mc2, we Ô¨Ånd 1 u=931.494013 MeV/c2. Whenmasses are expressed simply in terms of rest mass energies, as is often the case, the factorc2is implicitly assumed.The simplest isotope of hydrogen is composed of one proton and one electron and has amass ofmH=1.00782503214 u. This mass is actually very slightlylessthan the combinedmasses of the proton and electron taken separately. In fact, if the atom is in its ground state,the exact mass difference is 13.6 eV, which is just its ionization potential. Since mass isequivalent to a corresponding amount of energy, and the total mass‚Äìenergy of the systemmust be conserved, any loss in energy when the electron and proton combine to form anatom must come at the expense of a loss in total mass.Similarly, energy is also released with an accompanying loss in mass when nucleonsare combined to form atomic nuclei. A helium nucleus, composed of two protons andtwo neutrons, can be formed by a series of nuclear reactions originally involving fourhydrogen nuclei (i.e., 4H‚ÜíHe+low mass remnants). Such reactions are known asfusionreactions, since lighter particles are ‚Äúfused‚Äù together to form a heavier particle. (Conversely,aÔ¨Åssionreaction occurs when a massive nucleus is split into smaller fragments.) Thetotal mass of the four hydrogen atoms is 4.03130013 u, whereas the mass of one heliumatom ismHe=4.002603 u. Neglecting the contribution of low-mass remnants such asneutrinos, the combined mass of the hydrogen atomsexceedsthe mass of the helium atomby‚ÑìDelta1m=0.028697 u, or 0.7%. Therefore, the total amount of energy released in formingthe helium nucleus isEb=‚ÑìDelta1mc2=26.731 MeV. This is known as thebinding energyofthe helium nucleus. If the nucleus were to be broken apart into its constituent protons andneutrons, the amount of energy required to accomplish the task would be 26.731 MeV.Example 3.2.Is this source of nuclear energy sufÔ¨Åcient to power the Sun during itslifetime? For simplicity, assume also that the Sun was originally 100% hydrogen and thatonly the inner 10% of the Sun‚Äôs mass becomes hot enough to convert hydrogen into helium.Since 0.7% of the mass of hydrogen would be converted to energy in forming a heliumnucleus, the amount of nuclear energy available in the Sun would beEnuclear=0.1√ó0.007√óM‚äôc2=1.3√ó1044J.continuedThe quantityAjis approximately equal to the mass number.3

For a reactionto occur, the nuclei of atoms must collide, forming new nuclei in the process. However,all nuclei are positively charged, meaning that a Coulomb potential energy barrier mustbe overcome before contact can occur. Figure 4 shows the characteristic shape of thepotential energy curve that an atomic nucleus would experience when approaching anothernucleus.

If we assume that the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier is provided bythe thermal energy of the gas, and that all nuclei are moving nonrelativistically, then thetemperatureTclassicalrequired to overcome the barrier can be estimated.

For instance, not all particles in a gas of temperatureTwill have sufÔ¨Åcientkinetic energy and the necessary wavelength to tunnel through the Coulomb barrier suc-cessfully. Consequently, the reaction rate per energy interval must be described in termsof the number density of particles having energies within a speciÔ¨Åc range, combined withthe probability that those particles can actually tunnel through the Coulomb barrier of thetarget nucleus. The total nuclear reaction rate is then integrated over all possible energies.that particles are initially sufÔ¨Åciently far apart that the potential energy may be neglected,the nonrelativistic kinetic energy relation describes the total energy of the particles, orK=E=¬µmv2/2.

However, stellar thermal energies are quite lowcompared to energies found in laboratory experimentation, and signiÔ¨Åcant extrapolation isusually required to obtain comparison data for stellar nuclear reaction rates.The process of determiningœÉ(E)can be improved somewhat if the terms most stronglydependent on energy are factored out Ô¨Årst. We have already suggested that the cross sectioncan be roughly thought of as being a physical area. Moreover, the size of a nucleus, measuredin terms of its ability to ‚Äútouch‚Äù target nuclei, is approximately one de Broglie wavelengthin radius (r‚àºŒª).

If the barrier heightUciszero, the probability of successfully penetrating it necessarily equals one (100%). As thebarrier height increases relative to the initial kinetic energy of the incoming nucleus, theprobability of penetration must decrease, asymptotically approaching zero as the potentialenergy barrier height goes to inÔ¨Ånity.

These energies correspond to energy levels within thenucleus, analogous to the orbital energy levels of electrons. It is aresonancebetween theenergy of the incoming particle and differences in energy levels within the nucleus thataccounts for these strong peaks. A detailed discussion of these resonance peaks is beyondthe scope of this book.Electron ScreeningYet another factor inÔ¨Çuencing reaction rates iselectron screening.

Electron screening can be signiÔ¨Å-cant, sometimes enhancing the helium-producing reactions by 10% to 50%.Representing Nuclear Reaction Rates Using Power LawsIt is often illuminating to write the complicated reaction rate equations in the form of apower law centered at a particular temperature.

Equation ( 36) is another of the fundamental stellar structureequations.Stellar Nucleosynthesis and Conservation LawsThe remaining problem in understanding nuclear reactions is the exact sequence of stepsby which one element is converted into another, a process known asnucleosynthesis. Ourestimate of the nuclear timescale for the Sun was based on the assumption that four hydrogennuclei are converted into helium. However, it is highly unlikely that this could occur viaa four-body collision (i.e., all nuclei hitting simultaneously). For the process to occur, theÔ¨Ånal product must be created by a chain of reactions, each involving much more probabletwo-body interactions. In fact, we derived the reaction rate equation under the assumptionthat only two nuclei would collide at any one time.The process by which a chain of nuclear reactions leads to the Ô¨Ånal product cannothappen in a completely arbitrary way, however; a series of particleconservation lawsmustbe obeyed. In particular, during every reaction it is necessary to conserve electric charge,the number of nucleons, and the number of leptons. The termleptonmeans a ‚Äúlight thing‚Äùand includes electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and antineutrinos.Although antimatter is extremely rare in comparison with matter, it plays an importantrole in subatomic physics, including nuclear reactions. Antimatter particles are identical totheir matter counterparts but have opposite attributes, such as electric charge. Antimatteralso has the characteristic (often used in science Ô¨Åction) that a collision with its matter coun-terpart results in complete annihilation of both particles, accompanied by the production ofenergetic photons. For instance,e‚àí+e+‚Üí2Œ≥,wheree‚àí,e+, andŒ≥denote an electron, positron, and photon, respectively. Note that twophotons are required to conserve both momentum and energy simultaneously.ŒΩŒΩThese particles were originally proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, in order that energy and momentum mightbe conserved in certain reaction processes. In 1934, they were given the nameneutrinos(‚Äúlittle neutral ones‚Äù) byItalian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901‚Äì1954).7The Interiors of Stars

After being produced in thedeep interior, neutrinos almost always successfully escape from the star. One exception tothis transparency of stellar material to neutrinos occurs with important consequences duringa supernova explosionSince electrons and positrons have charges equal in magnitude to that of a proton, theseleptons will contribute to the charge conservation requirement while their totalleptonnumbersmust also be conserved. Note that in counting the number of leptons involved ina nuclear reaction, we treat matter and antimatter differently. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the total numberof matter leptonsminusthe total number of antimatter leptons must remain constant.To assist in counting the number of nucleons and the total electric charge, nuclei will berepresented in this text by the symbolAZX,where X is the chemical symbol of the element (H for hydrogen, He for helium, etc.),Zisthe number of protons (the total positive charge, in units ofe), andAis the mass number(the total number of nucleons, protons plus neutrons).The Proton‚ÄìProton ChainsApplying the conservation laws, one chain of reactions that can convert hydrogen intohelium is the Ô¨Årstproton‚Äìproton chain(PPI). It involves a reaction sequence that ultimatelyresults in411H‚Üí42He+2e++2ŒΩe+2Œ≥through the intermediate production of deuterium (21H) and helium-3 (32He).

Such a decay involvestheweak force, another of the four known forces.1Since an element is uniquely determined by the number of protons (Z) in the nucleus, specifying both X andZis redundant. As a result, some texts use the less cumbersome notationAX. However, this notation makes it moredifÔ¨Åcult to keep track of the electric charge in a nuclear reaction.Approximately 0.4% of the time, the Ô¨Årst reaction step is accomplished by the so-called pep reaction:11H+e‚àí+11H‚Üí21H+ŒΩe.1Each of the four forces has now been mentioned: the gravitational force, which involves all particles with mass‚Äìenergy; the electromagnetic force, associated with photons and electric charge; the strong force that binds nucleitogether; and the weak force of radioactive beta (electron/positron) decay.(37).

The production of helium-3 nuclei in the PP I chain also provides for the possibility oftheir interaction directly with helium-4 nuclei, resulting in a second branch of the proton‚Äìproton chain.

Thiscycle was proposed by Hans Bethe (1906‚Äì2005) in 1938, just six years after the discoveryof the neutron. In theCNO cycle, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are used as catalysts, beingconsumed and then regenerated during the process. Just as with the pp chain, the CNO cyclehas competing branches. The Ô¨Årst branch culminates with the production of carbon-12 andhelium-4:126C+11H‚Üí137N+Œ≥(48)137N‚Üí136C+e++ŒΩe(49)136C+11H‚Üí147N+Œ≥(50)147N+11H‚Üí158O+Œ≥(51)158O‚Üí157N+e++ŒΩe(52)157N+11H‚Üí126C+42He.(53)The second branch occurs only about 0.04% of the time and arises when the last reaction(Eq. 53) produces oxygen-16 and a photon, rather than carbon-12 and helium-4:157N+11H‚Üí168O+Œ≥(54)168O+11H‚Üí179F+Œ≥(55)179F‚Üí178O+e++ŒΩe(56)178O+11H‚Üí147N+42He.(57)1Expressions for the various correction terms are given in the stellar structure codeStatStar,described in Appendix: , A Binary1

As shown by the power law dependence, theCNO cycle is much more strongly temperature-dependent than is the pp chain. This propertyimplies that low-mass stars, which have smaller central temperatures, are dominated by thepp chains during their ‚Äúhydrogen burning‚Äù evolution, whereas more massive stars, withtheir higher central temperatures, convert hydrogen to helium by the CNO cycle. Thetransition in stellar mass between stars dominated by the pp chain and those dominatedby the CNO cycle occurs for stars slightly more massive than our Sun. This difference innuclear reaction processes plays an important role in the structure of stellar interiors, as willbe seen in the next section.When hydrogen is converted into helium by either the pp chain or the CNO cycle, themean molecular weight¬µof the gas increases. If neither the temperature nor the densityof the gas changes, the ideal gas law predicts that the central pressure will necessarilydecrease. As a result, the star would no longer be in hydrostatic equilibrium and wouldbegin to collapse.

Reactions marked by *** are ones for which energy is absorbed rather than released andare referred to as beingendothermic; energy-releasing reactions areexothermic. In en-dothermic reactions the product nucleus actually possesses more energy per nucleon thandid the nuclei from which it formed. Such reactions occur at the expense of the energyreleased by exothermic reactions or by gravitational collapse (the virial theorem). In gen-eral, endothermic reactions are much less likely to occur than exothermic reactions underconditions that normally prevail in stellar interiors.The Binding Energy Per NucleonA useful quantity in understanding the energy release in nuclear reactions is the bindingenergy per nucleon,Eb/A, whereEb=‚ÑìDelta1mc2=‚é©bracketleftbigZmp+(A‚àíZ)mn‚àímnucleus‚é©bracketrightbigc2.Figure 9 showsEb/Aversus the mass number. It is apparent that for relatively smallvalues ofA(less than 56), several nuclei have abnormally high values ofEb/Arelative toothers of similar mass. Among these unusually stable nuclei are42He and168O, which, alongwith11H, are the most abundant nuclei in the universe. This unusual stability arises froman inherent shell structure of the nucleus, analogous to the shell structure of atomic energylevels that accounts for the chemical nature of elements. These unusually stable nuclei arecalledmagic nuclei.It is believed that shortly after the Big Bang the early universe was composed primarilyof hydrogen and helium, with no heavy elements. Today, Earth and its inhabitants containan abundance of heavier metals. The study of stellar nucleosynthesis strongly suggests that

It can be said that we are all‚Äústar dust,‚Äù the product of heavy element generation within previous generations of stars.Another important feature of Fig. 9 is the broad peak aroundA=56. At the top ofthe peak is an isotope of iron,5626Fe, the most stable of all nuclei. As successively moremassive nuclei are created in stellar interiors, the iron peak is approached from the left.These fusion reactions result in the liberation of energy.1Consequently, the ultimate resultof successive chains of nuclear reactions within stars is the production of iron, assumingsufÔ¨Åcient energy is available to overcome the Coulomb barrier.

We have already related the funda-mental quantitiesP,M, andLto the independent variablerthrough differential equationsthat describe hydrostatic equilibrium, mass conservation, and energy generation, respec-tively; see Eqs. ( 6), ( 7), and ( 36). However, we have not yet found a differentialequation relating the basic parameter of temperature,T,t or. Moreover, we have not explic-itly developed equations that describe the processes by which heat generated via nuclearreactions or gravitational contraction is carried from the deep interior to the surface of thestar.Three Energy Transport MechanismsThree different energy transport mechanisms operate in stellar interiors.Radiationallowsthe energy produced by nuclear reactions and gravitation to be carried to the surface viaphotons, the photons being absorbed and re-emitted in nearly random directions as they

The Radiative Temperature GradientFirst consider radiation transport.he radiation pressure gradientis given bydPraddr=‚àíŒ∫œÅcFrad,whereFradis the outward radiative Ô¨Çux. However, from Eq. ( 19), the radiation pressuregradient may also be expressed asdPraddr=43aT3dTdr.Equating the two expressions, we havedTdr=‚àí34acŒ∫œÅT3Frad.Frad=Lr4œÄr2,the temperature gradient for radiative transport becomesdTdr=‚àí34acŒ∫œÅT3Lr4œÄr2.(68)As either the Ô¨Çux or the opacity increases, the temperature gradient must become steeper(more negative) if radiation is to transport all of the required luminosity outward. The samesituation holds as the density increases or the temperature decreases.The Pressure Scale HeightIf the temperature gradient becomes too steep, convection can begin to play an important rolein the transport of energy. Physically, convection involves mass motions: hot parcels of mat-ter move upward as cooler, denser parcels sink. Unfortunately, convection is a much morecomplex phenomenon than radiation at the macroscopic level. In fact, no truly satisfactoryprescription yet exists to describe it adequately in stellar environments.Fluid mechanics,the Ô¨Åeld of physics describing the motion of gases and liquids, relies on a complicated set ofthree-dimensional equations known as theNavier‚ÄìStokes equations. However, at present,due in large part to the current limitations in computing power,13most stellar structurecodes are one-dimensional (i.e., depend onronly). It becomes necessary, therefore, to ap-proximate an explicitly three-dimensional process by a one-dimensional phenomenological1This limitation is being overcome to some extent with the development of ever faster computers with morememory, and through the implementation of more sophisticated numerical techniques.T,

theory. To complicate the situation even more, when convection is present in a star, it is gen-erally quite turbulent, requiring a detailed understanding of the amount of viscosity (Ô¨Çuidfriction) and heat dissipation involved. Also, a characteristic length scale for convection,typically referred to in terms of thepressure scale height, is often comparable to the sizeof the star. Lastly, the timescale for convection, taken to be the amount of time requiredfor a convective element to travel a characteristic distance, is in some cases approximatelyequal to the timescale for changes in the structure of the star, implying that convection isstrongly coupled to the star‚Äôs dynamic behavior. The impact of these complications on thebehavior of the star is not yet fundamentally understood.The situation is not completely hopeless, however. Despite the difÔ¨Åculties encounteredin attempting to treat stellar convection exactly, approximate (and even reasonable) resultscan usually be obtained. To estimate the size of a convective region in a star, consider thepressure scale height,HP, deÔ¨Åned as1HP‚â°‚àí1PdPdr.(69)If we assume for the moment thatHPis a constant, we can solve for the variation of pressurewith radius, givingP=P0e‚àír/HP.Obviously, ifr=HP, thenP=P0e‚àí1, so thatHPis the distance over which the gaspressure decreases by a factor ofe. To Ô¨Ånd a convenient general expression forHP, recallthat from the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium (Eq. 6),dP/dr=‚àíœÅg, whereg=GMr/r2is the local acceleration of gravity. Substituting into Eq. ( 69), the pressure scaleheight is simplyHP=PœÅg.(70)Example 4.1.To estimate a typical value for the pressure scale height in the Sun,assume thatP=Pc/2, wherePcis the central pressure,œÅ‚äôis the average solar density,andg=G(M‚äô/2)(R‚äô/2)2=550 m s‚àí2.Then we haveHP‚âÉ1.8√ó108m‚àºR‚äô/4.Detailed calculations show thatHP‚àºR‚äô/10 is more typical.Internal Energy and the First Law of ThermodynamicsUnderstanding convective heat transport in stars, even in an approximate way, begins withsome knowledge of thermodynamics.

Throughout our discussion we will assume that these energy changes are measuredper unit mass.The internal energy of a systemUis astate function, meaning that its value dependsonly on the present conditions of the gas, not on the history of any changes leading toits current state. Consequently,dUis independent of the actual process involved in thechange. On the other hand, neither heat nor work is a state function. The amount of heatadded to a system or the amount of work done by a system depends on the ways in whichthe processes are carried out.dQanddWare referred to asinexact differentials, reÔ¨Çectingtheir path dependence.Consider an ideal monatomic gas, a gas composed of single particles with no ionization.The total internal energy per unit mass is given byU=(average energy/particle)√ó(number of particles/mass)=K√ó1mwherem=¬µmHis the average mass of a single particle in the gas.

DeÔ¨Åne the parameterŒ≥to be the ratio of speciÔ¨Åc heats, orŒ≥‚â°CPCV.(80)For a monatomic gas, we see thatŒ≥=5/3. If ionization occurs, some of the heat that wouldnormally go into increasing the average kinetic energy of the particles must go into ionizingthe atoms instead. Therefore the temperature of the gas, which is a measure of its internalenergy, will not rise as rapidly, implying larger values for the speciÔ¨Åc heats in a partialionization zone. As bothCPandCVincrease,Œ≥approaches unity.1The Adiabatic Gas LawSince the change in internal energy is independent of the process involved, consider thespecial case of anadiabatic process(dQ=0) for which no heat Ô¨Çows into or out of themass element. Then the Ô¨Årst law of thermodynamics (Eq. 73) becomesdU=‚àíPd V .However, from Eq.

The Adiabatic Sound SpeedUsing the results obtained thus far, we can now calculate a sound speed through the material.The sound speed is related to the compressibility of the gas and to its inertia (representedby density) and is given byvs=‚é©radicalbigB/œÅ,whereB‚â°‚àíV (‚àÇP/‚àÇV )adis the bulk modulus of the gas. The bulk modulus describeshow much the volume of the gas will change with changing pressure. From Eq.

The amount of time needed for a sound wave to traversethe radius of the Sun would then bet‚âÉR‚äô/vs‚âÉ29 minutes.The Adiabatic Temperature GradientReturning now to the speciÔ¨Åc problem of describing convection, we Ô¨Årst consider thesituation where a hot convective bubble of gas rises and expandsadiabatically, meaningthat the bubble does not exchange heat with its surroundings. After it has traveled somedistance, it Ô¨Ånallythermalizes, giving up any excess heat as it loses its identity and dissolvesinto the surrounding gas. Differentiating the ideal gas law (Eq. 11) yields an expressioninvolving the bubble‚Äôstemperature gradient(how the bubble‚Äôs temperature changes withposition):dPdr=‚àíP¬µd¬µdr+PœÅdœÅdr+PTdTdr.(85)Using the adiabatic relationship between pressure and density (Eq. 82), and recallingthatV‚â°1/œÅis the speciÔ¨Åc volume, we haveP=KœÅŒ≥.(86)Formally, the bulk modulus, and therefore the sound speed, must be deÔ¨Åned in terms of a process by whichpressure varies with volume. Since sound waves typically propagate through a medium too quickly for a signiÔ¨Åcantamount of heat to enter or leave a mass element in the gas, we usually assume that the process is adiabatic.17

It will beshown that in the deep interior of a star, if|dT /dr|actis justslightlylarger than|dT /dr|ad,this may be sufÔ¨Åcient to carry nearly all of the luminosity by convection. Consequently,it is often the case that either radiation or convection dominates the energy transport inthe deep interiors of stars, while the other energy transport mechanism contributes verylittle to the total energy outÔ¨Çow. The particular mechanism in operation is determinedby the temperature gradient. However, near the surface of the star the situation is muchmore complicated: Both radiation and convection can carry signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of energysimultaneously.A Criterion for Stellar ConvectionJust what condition must be met if convection is to dominate over radiation in the deepinterior?

In general, convection will occur when(1) the stellar opacity is large, implying that an unachievably steep temperature gradient(|dT /dr|act) would be necessary for radiative transport, (2) a region exists where ioniza-tion is occurring, causing a large speciÔ¨Åc heat and a low adiabatic temperature gradient(|dT /dr|ad), and (3) the temperature dependence of the nuclear energy generation rate islarge, causing a steep radiative Ô¨Çux gradient and a large temperature gradient. In the at-mospheres of many stars, the Ô¨Årst two conditions can occur simultaneously, whereas thethird condition would occur only deep in stellar interiors. In particular, the third conditioncan occur when the highly temperature-dependent CNO cycle or triple alpha processes areoccurring.The Mixing-Length Theory of Superadiabatic ConvectionIt has already been suggested that the temperature gradient must be only slightly superadi-abatic in the deep interior in order for convection to carry most of the energy. We will nowjustify that assertion.The Interiors of Stars

We begin by returning to the fundamental criterion for convection,œÅ(b)f<œÅ(s)f. Sincethe pressure of the bubble and that of its surroundings are always equal, the ideal gas lawimplies thatT(b)f>T(s)f, assuming thermal equilibrium initially.

In this situation, a detailed study of the relative amounts of convective andradiative Ô¨Çux must be considered. This will not be discussed further here.Although the mixing length theory is adequate for many problems, it is incomplete. Forinstance,Œ±andŒ≤arefree parametersthat must be chosen for a particular problem; theymay even vary throughout the star. There are also stellar conditions for which the time-independent mixing length theory is inherently unsatisfactory. As one example, considerstellar pulsations; during a star‚Äôs pulsation cycle the outer layers of the star are oscillatingwith periods comparable to the timescale for convection, given bytc=‚Ñì/vc. In such cases,rapid changes in the physical conditions in the star directly couple to the driving of theconvective bubbles, which in turn alters the structure of the star. Although much effort (andsome progress) has been made in developing a full, time-dependent convection theory forstellar interiors, at present no theory exists that completely describes this complex behavior.Much work remains to be done in understanding the important details of stellar convection.5STELLAR MODEL BUILDINGWe have now derived all of the fundamental differential equations of stellar structure. Theseequations, together with a set of relations describing the physical properties of the stellarmaterial, may be solved to obtain a theoretical stellar model.The Interiors of Stars

A Summary of the Equations of Stellar StructureFor convenience, the basictime-independent(static) stellar structure equations are summa-rized:dPdr=‚àíGMrœÅr2(6)dMrdr=4œÄr2œÅ(7)dLrdr=4œÄr2œÅœµ(36)dTdr=‚àí34acŒ∫œÅT3Lr4œÄr2(radiation)(68)=‚àí‚é©parenleftbigg1‚àí1Œ≥‚é©parenrightbigg¬µmHkGMrr2(adiabatic convection) (89)The last equation assumes that the convective temperature gradient is purely adiabatic andis applied whendlnPdlnT<Œ≥Œ≥‚àí1.(95)If the star is static, as assumed above, thenœµ=œµnuclear. However, if the structure of thestellar model is changing over time, we must include the energy contribution due to gravity,œµ=œµnuclear+œµgravity. The introduction of the gravitational energy term adds an explicit timedependence to the equations that is not present in the purely static case. This can be seen byrealizing that the virial theorem requires that one-half of the gravitational potential energythat is lost must be converted into heat. Therateof energy production (per unit mass) bygravity is thendQ/dt. Thereforeœµgravity=‚àídQ/dt, the minus sign indicating that heat isliberatedfromthe material.EntropyAs a note of interest, it is often useful to express the gravitational energy generation rate interms of the change in theentropyper unit mass (the speciÔ¨Åc entropy), deÔ¨Åned bydS‚â°dQT.(101)Then the energy generation rate is seen to be due to the change in entropy of the material,orœµgravity=‚àíTdSdt.(102)AlthoughdQis an inexact differential, it can be shown that the entropy is a state function.19

If the star is collapsing,œµgravitywill be positive; if it is expanding,œµgravitywill be negative.Thus, as the star contracts, its entropy decreases. This is not a violation of the second lawof thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of aclosedsystem must always remainthe same (reversible process) or increase (irreversible process). Since a star is not a closedsystem, its entropy may decrease locally while the entropy of the remainder of the universeincreases by a greater amount. The entropy is carried out of the star by photons and neutrinos.When changes in the structure of the star are sufÔ¨Åciently rapid that accelerations can nolonger be neglected, Eq. ( 6) must be replaced by the exact expression, Eq. ( 5). Sucha situation can occur during a supernova explosion or during stellar pulsations.The Constitutive RelationsThe basic stellar structure equations [( 6), ( 7), ( 36), ( 68), and ( 89)] requireinformation concerning the physical properties of the matter from which the star is made.The required conditions are the equations of state of the material and are collectively referredto asconstitutive relations. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we need relationships for the pressure, the opacity,and the energy generation rate, in terms of fundamental characteristics of the material: thedensity, temperature, and composition. In general,P=P (œÅ, T,composition)(103)Œ∫=Œ∫(œÅ, T,composition)(104)œµ=œµ(œÅ, T,composition)(105)The pressure equation of state can be quite complex in the deep interiors of certain classesof stars, where the density and temperature can become extremely high. However, in mostsituations, the ideal gas law, combined with the expression for radiation pressure, is a goodÔ¨Årst approximation, particularly when the variation in the mean molecular weight withcomposition and ionization is properly calculated. The pressure equation of state developedearlier (Eq. 20) includes both the ideal gas law and radiation pressure.The opacity of the stellar material cannot be expressed exactly by a single formula.Instead, it is calculated explicitly for various compositions at speciÔ¨Åc densities and temper-atures and presented in tabular form. Stellar structure codes either interpolate in a density‚Äìtemperature grid to obtain the opacity for the speciÔ¨Åed conditions, or, alternatively, use a‚ÄúÔ¨Åtting function‚Äù, based on the tabulated values. A similar situation also occurs for accurateTo calculate the nuclear energy generation rate, we can use formulas such as thosepresented in Section 3 for the pp chain (Eq. 46) and the CNO cycle (Eq. 58).In more sophisticated calculations,reaction networksare employed that yield individualreaction rates for each step of a process and equilibrium abundances for each isotope in themixture.The Interiors of Stars

Boundary ConditionsThe actual solution of the stellar structure equations, including the constitutive relations,requires appropriateboundary conditionsthat specify physical constraints to the math-ematical equations. Boundary conditions play the essential role of deÔ¨Åning the limits ofintegration. The central boundary conditions are fairly obvious‚Äînamely that the interiormass and luminosity must approach zero at the center of the star, orMr‚Üí0Lr‚Üí0‚é©bracerightbiggasr‚Üí0.(106)This simply means that the star is physically realistic and does not contain a hole, a core ofnegative luminosity, or central points of inÔ¨ÅniteœÅorœµ!A second set of boundary conditions is required at the surface of the star. The simplestset of assumptions is that the temperature, pressure, and density all approach zero at somesurface value for the star‚Äôs radius,R‚ãÜ, orT‚Üí0P‚Üí0œÅ‚Üí0‚é´‚é¨‚é≠asr‚ÜíR‚ãÜ.(107)Strictly, the conditions of Eqs. ( 107) will never be obtained in a real star (as is obviouslythe case for the temperature). Therefore, it is often necessary to use more sophisticated sur-face boundary conditions, such as when the star being modeled has an extended atmosphereor is losing mass, as most stars do.The Vogt‚ÄìRussell TheoremGiven the basic stellar structure equations, constitutive relations, and boundary conditions,we can now specify the type of star to be modeled. As can be seen by examination ofEq. ( 6), the pressure gradient at a given radius is dependent on the interior mass and thedensity. Similarly, the radiative temperature gradient (Eq. 36) depends on the local tem-perature, density, opacity, and interior luminosity, while the luminosity gradient is a functionof the density and energy generation rate. The pressure, opacity, and energy generation ratein turn depend explicitly on the density, temperature, and composition at that location. Ifthe interior mass at the surface of the star (i.e., the entire stellar mass) is speciÔ¨Åed, alongwith the composition, surface radius, and luminosity, application of the surface boundaryconditions allows for a determination of the pressure, interior mass, temperature, and inte-rior luminosity at an inÔ¨Ånitesimal distancedrbelow the surface of the star.2Continuingthisnumerical integrationof the stellar structure equations to the center of the star mustresult in agreement with the central boundary conditions (Eq. 106). Since the values2It is also necessary to specify the average density over that distance. SinceœÅis assumed to be zero at the surface,and since it depends explicitly on the pressure and temperature, which are also assumed to be zero at the surfaceand are initially unknown below the surface, an immediate difÔ¨Åculty arises; the right-hand sides of Eqs. ( 6) and00The Interiors of Stars
(68) are zero, so P and T never increase from their surface values! More sophisticated solutions require an itera-tive procedure, continually correcting previous estimates until a self-consistent answer is obtained to within some speciÔ¨Åed level of accuracy.

of the various gradients are directly related to the composition of the star, it is not possi-ble to specify any arbitrary combination of surface radius and luminosity after the massand composition have been selected. This set of constraints is known as theVogt‚ÄìRusselltheorem:The mass and the composition structure throughout a star uniquely determineits radius, luminosity, and internal structure, as well as its subsequent evolution.The dependence of a star‚Äô s evolution on mass and composition is a consequence of thechange in composition due to nuclear burning.21The statement of the V ogt‚ÄìRussell ‚Äútheo-rem‚Äù given here is somewhat misleading since there are other parameters that can inÔ¨Çuencestellar interiors, such as magnetic Ô¨Åelds and rotation. However, these parameters are as-sumed to have little effect in most stars and will not be discussed further.2Numerical Modeling of the Stellar Structure Equationsis accomplished by approximating the differential equations bydifference equations‚ÄîbyreplacingdP/drby‚ÑìDelta1P/‚ÑìDelta1r, for instance. The star is then imagined to be constructed ofspherically symmetricshells, as in Fig. 11, and the ‚Äúintegration‚Äù is carried out fromsome initial radius in Ô¨Ånite steps by specifying some incrementŒ¥r.2It is then possibleto increment each of the fundamental physical parameters through successive applicationsof the difference equations. For instance, if the pressure in zoneiis given byPi, then thepressure in the next deepest zone,Pi+1, is found fromPi+1=Pi+‚ÑìDelta1P‚ÑìDelta1rŒ¥r,whereŒ¥ris negative.The numerical integration of the stellar structure equations may be carried out from thesurface toward the center, from the center toward the surface, or, as is often done, in bothdirections simultaneously. If the integration is carried out in both directions, the solutionswill meet at someÔ¨Åtting pointwhere the variables must vary smoothly from one solutionto the other. This last approach is frequently taken because the most important physicalprocesses in the outer layers of stars generally differ from those in the deep interiors. Thetransfer of radiation through optically thin zones and the ionization of hydrogen and helium21In this sense, Eq. ( 36) does contain an implicit time dependence due to stellar nucleosynthesis.22Even without the complications of magnetic Ô¨Åelds and rotation, the V ogt‚ÄìRussell ‚Äútheorem‚Äù can be violated incertain special circumstances. However, an actual star (as opposed to a theoretical model) would probably adoptone unique structure as a consequence of its evolutionary history. In this sense, the V ogt‚ÄìRussell ‚Äútheorem‚Äù shouldbe considered a general rule rather than a rigorous law.2Codes that treat the radius as an independent variable are calledEuleriancodes.Lagrangiancodes treat themass as an independent variable. In the Lagrangian formulation, the differential equations are rewritten usingEq. ( 7); the hydrostatic equilibrium equation can be written in the formdP/dM, for instance.2

By integratingin both directions, it is possible to decouple these processes somewhat, simplifying theproblem.Simultaneously matching the surface and central boundary conditions for a desired stellarmodel usually requires several iterations before a satisfactory solution is obtained. If thesurface-to-center and center-to-surface integrations do not agree at the Ô¨Åtting point, thestarting conditions must be changed. This is accomplished in a series of attempts, callediterations, where the initial conditions of the next integration are estimated from the outcomeof the previous integration. A process of successive iterations is also necessary if the staris integrated from the surface to the center or from the center to the surface; in these casesthe Ô¨Åtting points are simply the center and surface, respectively.A very simple stellar structure code (calledStatStar)integratesthestellarstructure

Many of the sophisticated numerical techniques present in research codes have been neglected so that the basic elements of stellar model building can be more easily understood, as have the detailed calculations of the pressure equation of state and the opacity. The complex formalism of the mixing-length theory has also been left out in favor of the simplifying assumption of adiabatic convection. Despite these approximations, very reasonable models may be obtained for stars lying on the main sequence of the H‚ÄìR diagram.

situations, it is possible to Ô¨Ånd analytic solutions to a subset of the equations. The Ô¨Årstwork in this area was carried out by J. Homer Lane (1819‚Äì1880), who wrote a paper onthe equilibrium of stellar conÔ¨Ågurations in theAmerican Journal of Sciencein 1869. Thatwork was later extended signiÔ¨Åcantly by Robert Emden (1862‚Äì1940). Today, the famousequation that helps us describe analytical stellar models is referred to as theLane‚ÄìEmdenequation.To understand the motivation of developing the Lane‚ÄìEmden equation, note that carefulinspection of the stellar structure equations shows that the mechanical equations of stellarstructure (Eqs. 6 and 7) could be solved simultaneously without reference to theenergy equations ( 36, and either 68 or 89) if only a simple relationship existedbetween pressure and density. Of course, as we have seen, such a simple relationship doesnot generally exist; normally, temperature and composition must also enter into the pressureequation of state, often in a complicated way. However, under certain circumstances, suchas for an adiabatic gas (see Eq. 86), the pressure can be written explicitly in terms of thedensity alone. Hypothetical stellar models in which the pressure depends on density in theformP=KœÅŒ≥are known aspolytropes. The development of polytropic models is wellworth the effort since their relative simplicity allows us to gain some insight into stellarstructure without all of the complications inherent in full-blown numerical models.To derive the Lane‚ÄìEmden equation, we begin with the equation for hydrostatic equi-librium, Eq. ( 6). Rewriting the equation and taking the radial derivative of both sidesgivesddr‚é©parenleftbiggr2œÅdPdr‚é©parenrightbigg=‚àíGdMrdr.We immediately see that Eq.

( 108) is actually a slightly camou-Ô¨Çaged form of a very well-studied differential equation known asPoisson‚Äô s equation.I ti sleft as an exercise to show that Eq.

To solve Eq. ( 108), we now employ the relationshipP (œÅ)=KœÅŒ≥, whereKandŒ≥>0 are constants. This functional form of the pressure equation is known generally as apolytropic equation of state. Substituting, taking the appropriate derivative, and simplifying,we haveŒ≥Kr2ddr‚é©bracketleftbiggr2œÅŒ≥‚àí2dœÅdr‚é©bracketrightbigg=‚àí4œÄG œÅ.It is customary to rewrite the expression slightly by lettingŒ≥‚â°(n+1)/n, wherenishistorically referred to as thepolytropic index.

In addition, if the idealgas law and radiation pressure are assumed for constant composition (Eq. 20), then thetemperature proÔ¨Åle,T (r), is also obtained.In order to actually solve this second-order differential equation, it is necessary to im-pose two boundary conditions (which effectively specify the two constants of integration).Assuming that the ‚Äúsurface‚Äù of the star is that location where the pressure goes to zero (andcorrespondingly the density of the gas also goes to zero), thenDn(Œæ1)=0 speciÔ¨Åes the surface atŒæ=Œæ1,whereŒæ1is the location of the Ô¨Årst zero of the solution.Next consider the center of the star.

Recall that Eq.

Nevertheless, the Lane‚ÄìEmden equation is capable of givingus some important insights into the structures of stars.There are only three analytic solutions to the Lane‚ÄìEmden equation, namelyn=0, 1,and 5.

Although neither model can be solved analytically, the use of computers andnumerical integration algorithms allow us to explore their structure and behavior relativelyeasily. Careful study of these polytropes can yield important insights into the structures ofmore realistic, although signiÔ¨Åcantly more complex stellar models.6THE MAIN SEQUENCEThe analysis of stellar spectra tells us that the atmospheres of the vast majority of all stars arecomposed primarily of hydrogen, usually about 70% by mass (X‚àº0.7), whereas the massfraction of metals varies from near zero to approximately 3% (0<Z<0.03). Assumingthat the initial composition of a star ishomogeneous(meaning that the composition is thesame throughout), the Ô¨Årst set of nuclear fusion reactions ought to be those that converthydrogen into helium (the pp chains and/or the CNO cycle). Recall that these reactionsoccur at the lowest temperatures because the associated Coulomb barrier is lower thanthat for the burning of more massive nuclei. Consequently, the structure of a homogeneous,hydrogen-rich star ought to be strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by hydrogen nuclear burning deep withinits interior.Because of the predominance of hydrogen that initially exists in the core, and sincehydrogen burning is a relatively slow process, the interior composition and structure of thestar will change slowly. As we saw in Example 3.2, a rough estimate of the hydrogen-burning lifetime of the Sun is 10 billion years. Of course, the surface conditions will not becompletely static. By the V ogt‚ÄìRussell theorem, any change in composition or mass requiresa readjustment of the effective temperature and luminosity;the observational characteristicof the star must change as a consequence of the central nuclear reactions.As long as changesin the core are slow, so are the evolutionary changes in the observed surface features.2Since most stars have similar compositions, the structures of stars ought to vary smoothlywith mass. Recall from Examples 1.1 and 2.1 that as the mass increases, the centralpressure and the central temperature should increase. Therefore, for stars of low mass,the pp chain will dominate since less energy is required to initiate these reactions thanthe reactions of the CNO cycle. For high-mass stars, the CNO cycle will likely dominatebecause of its very strong temperature dependence.25be described by a polytropic index of 32Some short-period surface changes can occur that are essentially decoupled from the long-term variations in thecore. Stellar pulsations require speciÔ¨Åc conditions to exist, but their timescales are usually much shorter than thenuclear timescale.25

At some point, as progressively less massive stars are considered, the central temperaturewill diminish to the point where nuclear reactions are no longer able to stabilize a staragainst gravitational contraction. This has been shown to occur at approximately 0.072 M‚äôfor solar composition (the lower limit is slightly higher, 0.09 M‚äô, for stars with virtually nometal content,Z‚âÉ0). At the other extreme, stars with masses greater than approximately90 M‚äôbecome subject to thermal oscillations in their centers that may produce signiÔ¨Åcantvariations in the nuclear energy generation rates over timescales as short as 8 hours.The Eddington Luminosity LimitAlong with thermal oscillations, the stability of very massive stars is directly affected bytheir extremely high luminosities. As can be seen by Eq. ( 20), if the temperature issufÔ¨Åciently high and the gas density is low enough, it is possible for radiation pressure todominate over the gas pressure in certain regions of the star, a situation that can occur inthe outer layers of very massive stars.CombinedwiththerelationshipbetweenradiantÔ¨Çuxandluminosity,the pressure gradient near the surface may be written asdPdr‚âÉ‚àíŒ∫œÅcL4œÄr2.But hydrostatic equilibrium (Eq. 6) demands that the pressure gradient near the star‚Äôssurface must also be given bydPdr=‚àíGMœÅr2,whereMis the star‚Äôs mass. Combining, and solving for the luminosity, we haveLEd=4œÄGcŒ∫M.(114)LEdis the maximum radiative luminosity that a star can have and still remain in hydrostaticequilibrium. If the luminosity exceedsLEd, mass loss must occur, driven by radiationpressure. This luminosity maximum, known as theEddington limit, appears in a numberof areas of astrophysics, including late stages of stellar evolution, novae, and the structureof accretion disks.For our purposes, it is possible to make an estimate of the Eddington luminosity for starson the upper end of the main sequence. The effective temperatures of these massive starsare in the range of 50,000 K, high enough that most of the hydrogen is ionized in theirphotospheres. Therefore, the major contribution to the opacity is from electron scattering.ForX=0.7, Eq. (114) becomesLEd‚âÉ1.5√ó1031MM‚äôW orLEdL‚äô‚âÉ3.8√ó104MM‚äô.The Interiors of Stars

Effective temperatures are much less dependent on stellar mass. From approximately1700 K for 0.072 M‚äôstars to near 53,000 K for 90 M‚äôstars, the increase in effectivetemperature amounts to a factor of only about 20. However, this variation is still large enoughto dramatically change the stellar spectrum, since the dissociation energies of moleculesand the ionization potentials of most elements lie within this rangeConsequently, by comparison with theoretical models, it is possible to correlatemain-sequence masses with observed spectra.The interior structure of stars along the main sequence also varies with mass, primarilyin the location of convection zones. In the upper portion of the main sequence, whereenergy generation is due to the strongly temperature-dependent CNO cycle, convection isdominant in the core. This occurs because the rate of energy generation changes quicklywith radius, and radiation is not efÔ¨Åcient enough to transport all of the energy being releasedin nuclear reactions. Outside of the hydrogen-burning core, radiation is again capable ofhandling the Ô¨Çux, and convection ceases. As the stellar mass decreases, so does the centraltemperature and the energy output of the CNO cycle until, near 1.2M‚äô, the pp chain beginsto dominate and the core becomes radiative. Meanwhile, near the surface of the star, asof the surface convection zone lowers until the entire star becomes convective near 0.3M‚äô.Through the use of the fundamental physical principles developed thus far in this text,we have been able to build realistic models of main-sequence stars and develop an under-standing of their interiors.

the effective temperature decreases with decreasing mass, the opacity increases, in part because of the location of the zone of hydrogen ionization. The increase in opacity makes convection more efÔ¨Åcient than radiation near the surfaces of stars with masses less than approximately 1.3 M‚äô. This has the effect of creating convection zones near the surfaces of these stars.As we continue to move down the main sequence, the bottomthat do not lie along the main sequence. By considering the changes in stellar structure that occur because of changes in composition due to nuclear burning (the Vogt‚ÄìRussell theorem), it will become possible to explain their existence as well.

1 INTERSTELLAR DUST AND GAS
When we look into the heavens, it appears as though the stars are unchanging, point-like
sources of light that shine steadily. On casual inspection, even our own Sun appears constant.
In fact all stars change. Usually the changes are so gradual and over such long time
intervals when measured in human terms that we do not notice them without very careful
telescopic observation. Occasionally, however, the changes are extremely rapid and dra-
matic, as in the case of a supernova explosion. By invoking the understanding we developed
thus far of the physics of stellar interiors and atmospheres, we can now begin to examine
the processes governing how stars evolve during their lives.
The Interstellar Medium
In some sense the evolution of stars is a cyclic process. A star is born out of gas and dust
that exists between the stars, known as the interstellar medium (ISM). During its lifetime,
depending on the star‚Äôs total mass, much of that material may be returned to the ISM through
stellar winds and explosive events. Subsequent generations of stars can then form from this
processed material. As a result, to understand the evolution of a star, it is important to study
the nature of the ISM.
Understanding the interstellar medium is critical for more than its role in stellar evolution,
however. The ISM is of profound importance in describing the structure, dynamics, and
evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy, as well as galaxies throughout the universe. In addition,
it impacts our observations of everything from relatively nearby stars to the most remote
galaxies and quasars.But this is not the case; sunspots come and go, Ô¨Çares erupt, signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of matter 
are launched into space via coronal mass ejections, the corona itself changes shape, and 
even the Sun‚Äôs luminosity appears to be Ô¨Çuctuating over human timescales, as evidenced 
by the Maunder minimum. Of course, over the 4.57-Gyr lifetime of our Sun, the luminos-
ity, effective temperature, and radius have all changed substantially.

More fundamentally, the ISM is an enormous and complex environment that providesan important laboratory for testing our understanding of astrophysics at many levels. Thedynamics of the ISM involve turbulent gas motions, shocks, and galactic magnetic Ô¨Åeldsthat lace through interstellar space. Thus, modeling the ISM ultimately requires detailedsolutions to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. The dust, molecules, atoms, ions,and free electrons that permeate the ISM challenge our understanding of radiative transfer,thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. Moreover, the production and destruction ofdust grains and complex molecules requires a detailed understanding of chemistry in anenvironment not reproducible in a terrestrial laboratory.As an introduction to astrophysical processes, this text is unable to explore all of thefascinating aspects of the interstellar medium. Consequently, the present section servesonly as a brief introduction to general aspects of the ISM.Interstellar ExtinctionOn a dark night some of thedust cloudsthat populate our Milky Way Galaxy can beseen in the band of stars that is the disk of the Galaxy (see Fig. 1). It is not that thesedark regions are devoid of stars, but rather that the stars located behind intervening dustclouds are obscured. This obscuration, referred to asinterstellar extinction, is due to thesummative effects of scattering and absorption of starlight (as depicted in Fig. 2).Given the effect that extinction can have on the apparent magnitude of a star, the distancemodulusequationmustbemodiÔ¨Åedappropriately.InagivenwavelengthbandcenteredonŒª, we now havemŒª=MŒª+5 log10d‚àí5+AŒª,(1)wheredis the distance in pc andAŒª>0 represents the number of magnitudes of interstellarextinction present along the line of sight. IfAŒªis large enough, a star that would otherwisebe visible to the naked eye or through a telescope could no longer be detected. This is thereason for the dark bands running through the Milky Way.

FIGURE 2An interstellar cloud containing signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of dust along with the gas (a dustcloud) can both scatter and absorb light that passes through it. The amount of scattering and absorptiondepends on the number density of dust grains, the wavelength of the light, and the thickness of thecloud. Since shorter wavelengths are affected more signiÔ¨Åcantly than longer ones, a star lying behindthe cloud appears reddened to observer A. Observer B sees the scattered shorter wavelengths as ablue reÔ¨Çection nebula.ClearlyAŒªmust be related to the optical depth of the material, measured back along theline of sight.he fractional change in the intensity of the light is given byIŒª/IŒª,0=e‚àíœÑŒª,whereIŒª,0is the intensity in the absence of interstellar extinction.e can now relate the optical depth to the change in apparent magnitude due toextinction, givingmŒª‚àímŒª,0=‚àí2.5 log10/parenleftbige‚àíœÑŒª/parenrightbig=2.5œÑŒªlog10e=1.086œÑŒª.But the change in apparent magnitude is justAŒª, soAŒª=1.086œÑŒª.(2)The change in magnitude due to extinction is approximately equal to the optical depth alongthe line of sight.he optical depth through the cloud is given byœÑŒª=/integraldisplays0nd(s‚Ä≤)œÉŒªds‚Ä≤,(3)wherend(s‚Ä≤)is the number density of scattering dust grains andœÉŒªis the scattering crossTW

Thus we seethat the amount of extinction depends on the amount of interstellar dust that the light passesthrough, as one would expect.The Mie TheoryIf we assume for simplicity, as was Ô¨Årst done by Gustav Mie (1868‚Äì1957) in 1908, thatdust particles are spherical and each has a radiusa, then the geometrical cross section that aparticle presents to a passing photon is justœÉg=œÄa2. We may now deÔ¨Åne the dimensionlessextinction coefÔ¨ÅcientQŒªto beQŒª‚â°œÉŒªœÉg,whereQŒªdepends on the composition of the dust grains.Mie was able to show that when the wavelength of the light is on the order of the size ofthe dust grains, thenQŒª‚àºa/Œª, implying thatœÉŒª‚àùa3Œª(Œª/greaterorsimilara).(5)In the limit thatŒªbecomes very large relative toa,QŒªgoes to zero. On the other hand,ifŒªbecomes very small relative toa, it can be shown thatQŒªapproaches a constant,independent ofŒªso thatœÉŒª‚àùa2(Œª‚â™a).(6)These limiting behaviors can be understood by analogy to waves on the surface of a lake.If the wavelength of the waves is much larger than an object in their way, such as a grainof sand, the waves pass by almost completely unaffected (œÉŒª‚àº0). On the other hand, ifthe waves are much smaller than the obstructing object‚Äîfor instance, an island‚Äîthey aresimply blocked; the only waves that continue on are those that miss the island altogether.Similarly, at sufÔ¨Åciently short wavelengths, the only light we detect passing through thedust cloud is the light that travels between the particles.Combining the ideas already discussed, it is clear that the amount of extinction, asmeasured byAŒª, must be wavelength-dependent. Since the longer wavelengths of red lightare not scattered as strongly as blue light, the starlight passing through intervening dustclouds becomes reddened as the blue light is removed. Thisinterstellar reddeningcausesstars to appear redder than their effective temperatures would otherwise imply. Fortunately,it is possible to detect this change by carefully analyzing the absorption and emission linesin the star‚Äôs spectrum.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

Much of the incident blue light is scattered out of its original path and can leave the cloudin virtually any direction. As a result, looking at the cloud in a direction other than along theline of sight to a bright star behind the cloud, an observer will see a bluereÔ¨Çection nebula(recallFig.2)suchasthePleiadesThisprocessisanalogoustoRayleighscattering, which produces a blue sky on Earth. The difference between Mie scattering andRayleigh scattering is that the sizes of the scattering molecules associated with Rayleighscattering are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, leading toœÉŒª‚àùŒª‚àí4.Example 1.1.A certain star, located 0.8 kpc from Earth, is found to be dimmer thanexpected at 550 nm byAV=1.1 magnitudes, whereAVis the amount of extinction asmeasuredthroughthevisual wavelengthÔ¨ÅlterIfQ550=1.5andthedustgrainsareassumedtobesphericalwithradiiof0.2¬µm,estimatetheaveragedensity(n)ofmaterialbetweenthestarandEarth.From Eq.

However, at ultraviolet wavelengths signiÔ¨Åcant devia-tions become apparent, as can be seen by considering the ratio ofAŒª, the extinction in awavelength band centered atŒª, to the extinction in some reference wavelength band, suchasAV. This ratio is often plotted versus reciprocal wavelengthŒª‚àí1, as in Fig. 3. Alter-natively,color excessesare sometimes plotted instead, such as(AŒª‚àíAV)/(AB‚àíAV)orE(B‚àíV)‚â°(B‚àíV)intrinsic‚àí(B‚àíV)observed.At longer wavelengths (the left side of the graph) the data agree well with the Mie theory.For wavelengths shorter than the blue wavelength band (B), however, the curves begin todiverge signiÔ¨Åcantly, deviating from the expected relation,AŒª/AV‚àùŒª‚àí1. Particularly evi-dent is the ‚Äúbump‚Äù in the ultraviolet at 217.5 nm or 4.6¬µm‚àí1. At even shorter wavelengths,the extinction curve tends to rise sharply as the wavelength decreases.The existence of the ‚Äúbump‚Äù in Fig. 3 gives us some hint of the composition of thedust.

These are complex organic planar molecules with multiplebenzene ring-like structures that are probably responsible for a series of molecular bandsthat have been observed in emission in the light from diffuse dust clouds.1The so-calledunidentiÔ¨Åed infrared emission bandsexist in the wavelength range between 3.3¬µm and12¬µm; they appear to be due to vibrations in the C-C and C-H bonds common in PAHs. Justas transitions between atomic energy levels are quantized, so are the energies associatedwith molecular bonds. In the case of molecular bonds, however, the energy levels tend to begrouped in closely spaced bands, producing characteristic broad features in the spectrum ofthe light. The vibration, rotation, and bending of molecular bonds are all quantized, yieldingcomplex spectra that may be difÔ¨Åcult to identify in large molecules.Interstellar dust is composed of other particles as well, as evidenced by the existenceof dark absorption bands at wavelengths of 9.7¬µm and 18¬µm in the near-infrared. Thesefeatures are believed to be the result of the stretching of the Si-O molecular bond and the1The fact that molecules as complex as PAHs can exist in space has also been conÔ¨Årmed by their presence incertain types of meteorites found on Earth, known ascarbonaceous meteorites.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

The existence of these absorption bandsinvolving silicon indicates that silicate grains are also present in the dust clouds and thediffuse dust of the ISM.An important characteristic of the light scattered from interstellar dust is that it tends tobe slightly polarized. The amount of polarization is typically a few percent and dependson wavelength. This necessarily implies that the dust grains cannot be perfectly spherical.Furthermore, they must be at least somewhat aligned along a unique direction since theelectric Ô¨Åeld vectors of the radiation are preferentially oriented in a particular direction.The most likely way to establish such an alignment is for the grains to interact with a weakmagnetic Ô¨Åeld. Because less energy is required, the particles tend to rotate with their longaxes perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld.All of these observations give us some clues to the nature of the dust in the ISM. Ap-parently the dust in the ISM is composed of both graphite and silicate grains ranging insize from several microns down to fractions of a nanometer, the characteristic size of thesmaller PAHs. It appears that many of the features of the interstellar extinction curve canbe reproduced by combining the contributions from all of these components.Hydrogen as the Dominant Component of the ISMAlthough dust produces most of the obscuration that is readily noticeable, the dominantcomponent of the ISM is hydrogen gas in its various forms: neutral hydrogen (H I), ionizedhydrogen (H II), and molecular hydrogen (H2). Hydrogen comprises approximately 70%of the mass of matter in the ISM, and helium makes up most of the remaining mass; metals,such as carbon and silicon, account for only a few percent of the total.Most hydrogen indiffuseinterstellar hydrogen clouds is in the form ofHIi nt h egroundstate. As a result, the H I is generally incapable of producing emission lines by down-ward transitions of electrons from one orbit to another.

state. However, in certain unique circumstances, orbiting observatories have detected ab-sorption lines produced by cold clouds of H I when there are strong UV sources lying behindthem.21-cm Radiation of HydrogenFortunately, it is still generally possible to identify neutral hydrogen in the diffuse ISM. Thisis done by detecting the unique radio-wavelength21-cm line. The 21-cm line is producedby the reversal of the spin of the electron relative to the proton in the atom‚Äôs nucleus.oth electrons and protons possess an inherent spin angular momentum,with thez-component of the spin angular momentum vector having one of two possibleorientations, corresponding to the two allowed values of the spin quantum number,ms=¬±12. Because these particles are also electrically charged, their intrinsic spins endow themwith dipole magnetic Ô¨Åelds, much like those of bar magnets. If the spins of the electronand proton are aligned (e.g., both spin axes are in the same direction), the atom has slightlymore energy than if they are anti-aligned (see Fig. 5). As a result, if the electron‚Äôs spin‚ÄúÔ¨Çips‚Äù from being aligned with the proton to being anti-aligned, energy must be lost fromthe atom. If the spin Ô¨Çip is not due to a collision with another atom, then a photon is emitted.Of course, a photon can also be absorbed, exciting a hydrogen atom into aligning its electronand proton spins. The wavelength of the photon associated with the spin Ô¨Çip is 21.1 cm,corresponding to a frequency of 1420 MHz.The emission of a 21-cm photon from an individual hydrogen atom is extremely rare.Once in the excited state, several million years can pass on average before that atom willemit a photon. Competing with this spontaneous emission are collisions between hydrogenatoms that may result in either excitation or de-excitation. In the low-density environmentof the diffuse ISM, collisions occur on timescales of hundreds of years. Although this isfar shorter than the spontaneous emission timescale, statistically some atoms are still ableto make the necessary spontaneous transition. In contrast, the best vacuums produced inProtonElectronAligned

Earth-based laboratories have densities much greater than those found in the ISM, meaningthat collision rates are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in laboratory environments and virtually all of theatoms in the laboratory are de-excited before they can emit 21-cm radiation. The existenceof 21-cm radiation was predicted in the early 1940s and Ô¨Årst detected in 1951. Since thenit has become an important tool in mapping the location and density of H I, measuringradial velocities using the Doppler effect, and estimating magnetic Ô¨Åelds using the Zeemaneffect. 21-cm radiation is particularly valuable in determining the structure and kinematicproperties of galaxies, including our own.Although H I is quite abundant, the rarity of 21-cm emission (or absorption) from individ-ual atoms means that the center of this line can remain optically thin over large interstellardistances. Assuming that the line proÔ¨Åle is a Gaussian, like the shape of the Doppler lineproÔ¨Åle the optical depth of the line center is given byœÑH=5.2√ó10‚àí15NHT‚ÑìDelta1 v,(7)whereNHis the column density of H I (in units of m‚àí2),Tis the temperature of the gas (inkelvins), and‚ÑìDelta1vis the full width of the line at half maximum (in km s‚àí1). [Note that sincethe line width is due primarily to the Doppler effect‚ÑìDelta1vis expressed in units ofvelocity,ratherthaninwavelengthunits;typically‚ÑìDelta1v‚àº10 km s‚àí1.]As long as the 21-cm hydrogen line is optically thin (i.e., on the linear part of the curve ofgrowththeopticaldepthisproportionaltotheneutralhydrogencolumndensity.Studies ofdiffuse H I cloudsindicate temperatures of 30 to 80 K, number densities in therange of 1√ó108m‚àí3to 8√ó108m‚àí3, and masses on the order of 1‚Äì100 M‚äô.ComparingœÑHwithAValong the same line of sight shows thatNHis generally pro-portional toNd(the column density of dust) whenAV<1. This observation suggests thatdust and gas are distributed together throughout the ISM. However, whenAV>1, thiscorrelation breaks down; the column density of H I no longer increases as rapidly as thecolumn density of dust. Apparently, other physical processes are involved when the dustbecomes optically thick.Optically thick dust clouds shield hydrogen from sources of ultraviolet radiation. Oneconsequence of this shielding is that molecular hydrogen can exist without the threat ofundergoing dissociation by UV photon absorption. Dust can also enhance the H2formationrate beyond what would be expected by random collisions of hydrogen atoms. This en-hancement occurs for two reasons: (1) A dust grain can provide asiteon the surface of thegrain where the hydrogen atoms can meet, rather than requiring chance encounters in theISM, and (2) the dust provides asinkfor the binding energy that must be liberated if a stablemolecule is to form. The liberated energy goes into heating the grain and ejecting the H2molecule from the formation site. If the column density of atomic hydrogen is sufÔ¨Åcientlylarge (NHon the order of 1025m‚àí2), it can also shield H2from UV photodissociation.Consequently,molecular cloudsare surrounded by shells of H I.Molecular Tracers of H2Since the structure of H2differs greatly from that of atomic hydrogen, the H2molecule doesnot emit 21-cm radiation. This explains whyNHandAVare poorly correlated in molecular,,),The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

clouds whenAV>1; the number density of atomic hydrogen decreases signiÔ¨Åcantly as thehydrogen becomes locked up in its molecular form.Unfortunately, H2is very difÔ¨Åcult to observe directly because the molecule does nothave any emission or absorption lines in the visible or radio portions of the electromagneticspectrum at the cool temperatures typical of the ISM. In special circumstances whenT>2000 K, it is possible to detect rotational and vibrational bands (known collectively asrovibrational bands) associated with the molecular bond. However, in most instances itbecomes necessary to use other molecules astracersof H2by making the assumptionthat their abundances are proportional to the abundance of H2. Because of its relativelyhigh abundance (approximately 10‚àí4that of H2), the most commonly investigated tracer iscarbon monoxide, CO, although other molecules have also been used, including CH, OH,CS, C3H2, HCO+, and N2H+. It is also possible to useisotopomersof the molecules, suchas13CO or C18O, to further reÔ¨Åne studies of molecular clouds. Given that molecules havemoments of inertia that affect their spectra, different isotopes in molecules result in differentspectral wavelengths(Note that when the speciÔ¨Åc isotopeisnotindicated,itisassumedthatthemostabundantisotopeisimplied;thusCOimplies12C16O.)During collisions the tracer molecules become excited (or de-excited) and spontaneoustransitions from excited states result in the emission of photons in wavelength regions thatare more easily observed than those associated with H2, such as the 2.6-mm transition ofCO. Since collision rates depend on both the gas temperature (or thermal kinetic energy)and the number densities of the species, molecular tracers can provide information aboutthe environment within a molecular cloud. In fact, an estimate of atomic and molecularcollision rates can be made in a way completely analogous to the approach used to obtainthe nuclear reaction rate equation.The ClassiÔ¨Åcation of Interstellar CloudsThe results of these studies show that conditions within molecular clouds can vary widely.Consequently, any effort to specify a discrete classiÔ¨Åcation scheme is destined to fail becausethe delineation between types is blurred at best. However, even with that caveat, a broadclassiÔ¨Åcation scheme is still useful for distinguishing the general characteristics of speciÔ¨Åcenvironments.In clouds where the hydrogen gas is primarily atomic and the interstellar extinctionis roughly 1<AV<5, molecular hydrogen may be found in regions of higher columndensity. Such clouds are sometimes referred to asdiffuse molecular clouds, or alternativelyastranslucent molecular clouds. Conditions in diffuse molecular clouds are typical ofdiffuse H I clouds but with somewhat higher masses; they have temperatures of 15 to 50 K,n‚àº5√ó108to 5√ó109m‚àí3,M‚àº3 to 100 M‚äô, and they measure several parsecs across.Both H I clouds and diffuse molecular clouds tend to be irregularly shaped.Giant molecular clouds(GMCs) are enormous complexes of dust and gas wheretemperatures are typicallyT‚àº15 K, number densities are in the rangen‚àº1√ó108to3√ó108m‚àí3, masses are typically 105M‚äôbut may reach 106M‚äô, and typical sizes are onthe order of 50 pc across.

Based onobservations from infrared telescopes such as NASA‚Äôs Spitzer Space Telescope and theEuropean Space Agency‚Äôs Infrared Space Observatory, hot cores appear to have massive,young O and B stars embedded within them, suggesting strongly that these are regions ofrecent star formation.Located outside of larger molecular complexes are the almost spherical clouds known asBok globules(see, for example, Fig. 7).2These globules are characterized by large visualextinctions (AV‚àº10), low temperatures (T‚àº10 K), relatively large number densities(n>1010m‚àí3), low masses (M‚àº1 to 1000 M‚äô), and small sizes of typically less than1 pc.

As of June 2005, radio observations have resulted in the positive identiÔ¨Å-cation of 125 molecules (not including isotopomers), ranging in complexity from diatomicmolecules such as H2and CO, and triatomic molecules such as H2O and H+3, to fairly longorganic strings, including HC11N.Given the complex nature of the molecules present in the interstellar medium, it is evidentthat the chemistry of the ISM is also quite complex. The speciÔ¨Åc processes in operation ina given molecular cloud depend on the density and temperature of the gas, as well as itscomposition and the presence of dust grains. We notedthat dust grains must bepresent for the formation of molecular hydrogen, H , the dominant constituent in molecular2clouds. It is also likely that dust grains can help facilitate the formation of numerous othermolecules as well, including CH, NH, OH, CH2, CO, CO2, and H2O. In fact, in sufÔ¨Åcientlydense clouds, the formation of molecules on the surfaces of grains can actually lead to thedevelopment of icy mantles on the grains. Absorption signatures of solid CO, CO2,H2O,CH4,C H3OH, NH3, and other ices have been measured in combination with the infraredspectra of silicate dust grains.In addition to the chemistry that can occur on grain surfaces, it is also possible formolecules to form in the gas phase. For example, the hydroxyl molecule (OH) can formthrough a series of reactions involving atomic and molecular ions, including the ionic waterearlier The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

You may have noticed that diffuse molecular clouds have higher gas temperaturesthan giant molecular clouds, and the dense cores of GMCs are even cooler yet. On the otherhand, the hot cores of GMCs have signiÔ¨Åcantly greater temperatures. What are the physicalcauses of these observational trends?Much of the heating of the interstellar medium comes fromcosmic rays, charged particlesthat travel through space with sometimes astonishing amounts of energy. A single protonmay possess an energy ranging anywhere from 10 to 1014MeV.3The highest energy cosmicrays are extremely rare, but energies in the range 103to 108MeV are common. The sourcesof cosmic rays include stellar Ô¨Çares and supernova explosionsHeating by cosmic rays comes primarily through the ionization of hydrogen atoms andmolecules as a result of collisions with cosmic ray protons;p++H‚ÜíH++e‚àí+p+p++H2‚ÜíH+2+e‚àí+p+.When an atom or molecule is ionized, an electron is ejected that carries some of the originalkinetic energy of the proton with it. It is this ejected electron that interacts with the ISM toincrease the average kinetic energy of the ISM‚Äôs constituents via collisions with molecules(see, for example, Eqs. 8 and 9). Those molecules then collide with other molecules31014MeV is roughly the kinetic energy of a tennis ball of mass 0.057 kg traveling at 100 km h‚àí1(approximately60 mph)..The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

in the gas, distributing thermal kinetic energy throughout the cloud, thereby raising thetemperature of the cloud.Other sources of heating in molecular clouds include the ionization of carbon atomsby ultraviolet starlight resulting in ejected electrons, the photoelectric ejection of electronsfrom dust grains by ultraviolet starlight, the absorption of light energy into the lattice ofdust grains, and the ionization of hydrogen by stellar X-rays. Shocks from supernovae orstrong stellar winds can also produce some heating of molecular clouds in special cases.To balance the heating processes, cooling mechanisms must also be in operation. Theprimary mechanism for cooling is based on the emission of infrared photons. RecallingMie scattering (Eq. 5), when photon wavelengths are on the order of, or longer than,the size of dust grains, they are less likely to be scattered. IR photons can pass more easilythrough the molecular cloud than can shorter-wavelength photons, allowing the IR photonsto transport energy out of the cloud.IR photons are produced in molecular clouds through collisions between ions, atoms,molecules, and dust grains. Typically a collision between ions, atoms, or molecules resultsin one of the species being left in an excited state; the energy of the excited state comesfrom the kinetic energy of the collision. The species in the excited state then decays backto the ground state through the emission of an IR photon. For example,O+H‚ÜíO‚àó+H(10)O‚àó‚ÜíO+Œ≥.(11)Here O‚àórepresents an excited state of the oxygen atom. The collisional kinetic energy(thermal energy) is thus transformed into an IR photon that escapes the cloud. Collisionalexcitations of C+and CO by H and H2, respectively, are also signiÔ¨Åcant contributors tocooling of molecular clouds.Collisions involving dust grains can also result in cooling of molecular clouds. Thisprocess is similar to ionic, atomic, and molecular collisions in that the lattice of a dust graincan be left with excess thermal energy after the collision. The grain then emits infraredenergy that is able to escape from the cloud.The Sources of Dust GrainsIt is apparent that even though dust grains make up only about one percent of the mass of amolecular cloud, they are important constituents in determining its chemistry and physics.The question of the source of these grains then naturally arises. Although observationsindicate that dust grains can be formed in the envelopes of very cool stars, aided by theenhanced density in those environments relative to molecular clouds, grains can also beeasily destroyed by UV and X-ray photons. Dust grains are also formed as a product ofsupernova explosions and stellar winds. However, none of these sources appear to be able toprovide the abundance of massive grains found in molecular clouds. Rather, it appears thatgrains probably grow by a process of coagulation within the molecular clouds themselves.Dust grain formation represents just one of many areas of active research into the nature ofthe ISM.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

2THE FORMATION OF PROTOSTARSOur understanding of stellar evolution has developed signiÔ¨Åcantly since the 1960s, reachingthe point where much of the life history of a star is well determined. This success has beendue to advances in observational techniques, improvements in our knowledge of the physicalprocesses important in stars, and increases in computational power. In the remainder of thischapterwe will present an overview of the lives of stars,leavingdetaileddiscussionsofsomespecialphasesofevolutionuntillater,speciÔ¨Åcallystellarpulsation,supernovae,andcompactobjects(stellarcorpses).The Jeans CriterionDespite many successes, important questions remain concerning how stars change duringtheir lifetimes. One area where the picture is far from complete is in the earliest stage of evo-lution, the formation of pre-nuclear-burning objects known asprotostarsfrom interstellarmolecular clouds.If globules and cores in molecular clouds are the sites of star formation, what conditionsmust exist for collapse to occur? Sir James Jeans (1877‚Äì1946) Ô¨Årst investigated this prob-lem in 1902 by considering the effects of small deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium.Although several simplifying assumptions are made in the analysis, such as neglecting ef-fects due to rotation, turbulence, and galactic magnetic Ô¨Åelds, it provides important insightsinto the development of protostars.The virial theorem2K+U=0,describes the condition of equilibrium for a stable, gravitationally bound system.4We havealready seen that the virial theorem arises naturally in the discussion of orbital motion, andwe have also invoked it in estimating the amount of gravitational energy contained withina starThevirialtheoremmayalsobeusedtoestimatetheconditionsnecessaryforprotostellarcollapse.If twice the total internal kinetic energy of a molecular cloud (2K) exceeds the absolutevalue of the gravitational potential energy (|U|), the force due to the gas pressure willdominate the force of gravity and the cloud will expand. On the other hand, if the internalkinetic energy is too low, the cloud will collapse. The boundary between these two casesdescribes the critical condition for stability when rotation, turbulence, and magnetic Ô¨Åeldsare neglected.Assuming a spherical cloud of constant density, the gravitational potential energy isapproximatelyU‚àº‚àí35GM2cRc,whereMcandRcare the mass and radius of the cloud, respectively. We may also estimate4We have implicitly assumed that the kinetic and potential energy terms are averaged over time.,

The smaller constant for the Bonnor‚ÄìEbertmass is to be expected since an external compression force due toP0is being exerted onthe cloud.5Example 2.1.For a typical diffuse hydrogen cloud,T=50 K andn=5√ó108m‚àí3.I fwe assume that the cloud is entirely composed of H I,œÅ0=mHnH=8.4√ó10‚àí19kg m‚àí3.Taking¬µ=1 and using Eq.

However, this value signiÔ¨Åcantlyexceeds the estimated 1 to 100 M‚äôbelieved to be contained in H I clouds. Hence diffusehydrogen clouds are stable against gravitational collapse.On the other hand, for a dense core of a giant molecular cloud, typical temperatures andnumber densities areT=10 K andnH2=1010m‚àí3. Since dense clouds are predominantlymolecular hydrogen,œÅ0=2mHnH2=3√ó10‚àí17kg m‚àí3and¬µ‚âÉ2. In this case the Jeansmass isMJ‚àº8M‚äô, characteristic of the masses of dense cores being on the order of 10 M‚äô.Apparently the dense cores of GMCs are unstable to gravitational collapse, consistent withbeing sites of star formation.If the Bonnor‚ÄìEbert mass (Eq. 17) is used as the critical collapse condition, then therequired mass reduces to approximately 2 M‚äô.Homologous CollapseIn the case that the criterion for gravitational collapse has been satisÔ¨Åed in the absence ofrotation, turbulence, or magnetic Ô¨Åelds, the molecular cloud will collapse. If we make thesimplifying (and possibly unrealistic) assumption that any existing pressure gradients aretoo small to inÔ¨Çuence the motion appreciably, then the cloud is essentially in free-fall duringthe Ô¨Årst part of its evolution. Furthermore, throughout the free-fall phase, the temperature5You may be interested to know that the derivation of Eq. ( 17) involves theisothermal Lane‚ÄìEmden equationT

This is trueas long as the cloud remains optically thin and the gravitational potential energy releasedduring the collapse can be efÔ¨Åciently radiated away.

After canceling the density on both sides of the expression, wehaved2rdt2=‚àíGMrr2.(19)Of course, the right-hand side of Eq.

As usual, the mass of the sphere interior tothe radiusris denoted byMr.To describe the behavior of the surface of a sphere of radiusrwithin the collapsing cloudas a function of time, Eq. ( 19) must be integrated over time. Since we are interested onlyin the surface that enclosesMr, the mass interior torwill remain a constant during thatcollapse. As a result, we may replaceMrby the product of the initial densityœÅ0and theinitial spherical volume, 4œÄr30/3. Then, if we multiply both sides of Eq. ( 19) by thevelocity of the surface of the sphere, we arrive at the expressiondrdtd2rdt2=‚àí/parenleftbigg4œÄ3GœÅ0r30/parenrightbigg1r2drdt,which can be integrated once with respect to time to give12/parenleftbiggdrdt/parenrightbigg2=/parenleftbigg4œÄ3GœÅ0r30/parenrightbigg1r+C1.The integration constant,C1, can be evaluated by requiring that the velocity of the sphere‚Äôssurface be zero at the beginning of the collapse, ordr/dt=0 whenr=r0.

which leads to the differential equationdŒ∏dt=‚àíœá/parenleftbigg1Œ∏‚àí1/parenrightbigg1/2.(21)Making yet another substitution,Œ∏‚â°cos2Œæ,(22)and after some manipulation, Eq.

Doing so requires thatr=r0whent=0, which implies thatŒ∏=1, orŒæ=0 at the beginning of the collapse. Therefore,C2=0.We have Ô¨Ånally arrived at the equation of motion for the gravitational collapse of thecloud, given in parameterized form byŒæ+12sin 2Œæ=œát.(25)Our task now is to extract the behavior of the collapsing cloud from this equation. FromEq. ( 25), it is possible to calculate thefree-fall timescalefor a cloud that has satisÔ¨Åedthe Jeans criterion.

Consequently, as long as the original density of the spherical molecular cloudwas uniform, all parts of the cloud will take the same amount of time to collapse, and thedensity will increase at the same rate everywhere. This behavior is known as ahomologouscollapse.6This is obviously an unphysical Ô¨Ånal condition, since it implies inÔ¨Ånite density. Ifr0‚â´rÔ¨Ånal, however, thenrÔ¨Ånal‚âÉ0 is a reasonable approximation for our purposes here.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

However, if the cloud is somewhat centrally condensed when the collapse begins, thefree-fall time will be shorter for material near the center than for material farther out. Thus,as the collapse progresses, the density will increase more rapidly near the center than inother regions. In this case the collapse is referred to as aninside-out collapse.Example 2.2.Using data given in Example 2.1 for a dense core of a giant molecularcloud, we may estimate the amount of time required for the collapse. Assuming a densityofœÅ0=3√ó10‚àí17kg m‚àí3that is constant throughout the core, Eq. ( 26) givestff=3.8√ó105yr.To investigate the actual behavior of the collapse in our simpliÔ¨Åed model, we mustÔ¨Årst solve Eq. ( 25) forŒæ, given a value fort, and then use Eq. ( 22) to Ô¨ÅndŒ∏=r/r0. However, Eq. ( 25) cannot be solved explicitly, so numerical techniques must beemployed. The numerical solution of the homologous collapse of the molecular cloud isshown in Fig. 8. Notice that the collapse is quite slow initially and accelerates quicklyastffis approached. At the same time, the density increases very rapidly during the Ô¨Ånalstages of collapse.The Fragmentation of Collapsing CloudsSince the masses of fairly large molecular clouds could exceed the Jeans limit, fromEq. ( 14) our simple analysis seems to imply that stars can form with very large masses,possibly up to the initial mass of the cloud. However, observations show that this doesnot happen. Furthermore, it appears that stars frequently (perhaps even preferentially) tendto form in groups, ranging from binary star systems to clusters that contain hundreds ofthousands of members.The process offragmentationthat segments a collapsing cloud is an aspect of starformation that is under signiÔ¨Åcant investigation.

some mechanism(s), refer again to the equation for the Jeans mass (Eq. 14).An importantconsequence of the collapse of a molecular cloud is that the density of the cloud increases bymany orders of magnitude during free-fall (Fig. 8). Consequently, sinceTremains nearlyconstant throughout much of the collapse, it appears that the Jeans mass must decrease.Aftercollapse has begun, any initial inhomogeneities in density will cause individual sectionsof the cloud to satisfy the Jeans mass limit independently and begin to collapse locally,producing smaller features within the original cloud. This cascading collapse could lead tothe formation of large numbers of smaller objects.It is important to point out that one challenge with the overly simpliÔ¨Åed scenario describedhere is that the process implies that far too many stars would be produced. It is likely thatonly about 1% of the cloud actually forms stars.What is it that stops the fragmentation process? Since we observe a galaxy Ô¨Ålled withstars that have masses on the order of the mass of the Sun, the cascading fragmentationof the cloud cannot proceed without interruption. The answer to the question lies in ourimplicit assumption that the collapse is isothermal, which in turn implies that the onlyterm that changes in Eq. ( 14) is the density. Clearly this cannot be the case since starshave temperatures much higher than 10 to 100 K. If the energy that is released duringa gravitational collapse is radiated away efÔ¨Åciently, the temperature can remain nearlyconstant. At the other extreme, if the energy cannot be transported out of the cloud at all(anadiabaticcollapse), then the temperature must rise. Of course, the real situation mustbe somewhere between these two limits, but by considering each of these special casescarefully, we can begin to understand some of the important features of the problem.If the collapse changes from being essentially isothermal to adiabatic, the associatedtemperature rise would begin to affect the value of the Jeans mass.or an adiabatic process the pressure of the gas is related to its density byŒ≥, the ratio ofspeciÔ¨ÅcheatsUsingtheidealgaslawanadiabaticrelationbetweendensityandtemperaturecanbeobtained,T=K‚Ä≤‚Ä≤œÅŒ≥‚àí1,(27)whereK‚Ä≤‚Ä≤is a constant.

This behavior means that the collapseresults in a minimum value for the mass of the fragments produced. The minimum massdepends on the point when the collapse goes from being predominantly isothermal to adi-abatic.Of course, this transition is not instantaneous or even complete. However, it is possible tomake a crude order-of-magnitude estimate of the lower mass limit of the fragments. As wehave already mentioned, according to the virial theorem, energy must be liberated duringthe collapse of the cloud.he energy released is roughly‚ÑìDelta1Eg‚âÉ310GM2JRJF.,

For in-stance, we have freely used the Jeans criterion during each point in the collapse of thecloud to discuss the process of fragmentation. This cannot be correct, since our estimateof the Jeans criterion was based on a perturbation of a static cloud; no consideration wasmade of the initial velocity of the cloud‚Äôs outer layers. We have also neglected the detailsWThe Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

of radiation transport through the cloud, as well as vaporization of the dust grains, disso-ciation of molecules, and ionization of the atoms. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that asunsophisticated as the preceding analysis was, it did illustrate important aspects of the fun-damental problem and left us with a result that is reasonable. Such preliminary approachesto understanding complex physical systems are powerful tools in our study of nature.7Moresophisticated estimates of the complex process of cessation of fragmentation place the limitan order of magnitude lower than determined above, at about 0.01 M‚äô.Perhaps just as important to the problem of the collapse process are the possible effects ofrotation (angular momentum), the deviation from spherical symmetry, turbulent motions inthe gas, and the presence of magnetic Ô¨Åelds. For example, an appreciable amount of angularmomentum present in the original cloud is likely to result in a disk-like structure for at leasta part of the original material, since collapse will proceed at a more rapid rate along theaxis of rotation relative to collapse along the equatorIt is also apparent from careful investigations of molecular clouds that magnetic Ô¨Åeldsmust also play a crucial role and, in fact, are likely to control the onset of collapse. Thatmechanisms other than gravity must be involved becomes clear in simply considering thefree-fall time of the dense core discussed in Example 2.2. From that calculation, thecollapse of the dense core should occur on a timescale on the order of 105yr. While thismay seem long by human standards, it is quite short on stellar evolution timescales. Thiswould imply that almost as soon as a dense core forms, it begins producing stars. This wouldalso imply that dense cores should be very rare; however, many dense cores are observablethroughout our Galaxy.Zeeman measurements of various molecular clouds indicate the presence of magneticÔ¨Åelds with strengths typically on the order of magnitude of 1 to 100 nT. If the magneticÔ¨Åeld of a cloud is ‚Äúfrozen in,‚Äù and the cloud is compressed, the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength willincrease, leading to an increase in the magnetic pressure and resistance to the compression.In fact, if the cloud is stable to collapse because of magnetic pressure, it will remain so aslong as the magnetic Ô¨Åeld does not decayDuring the derivation of the Jeans criterion, the virial theorem was invoked using abalance between gravitational potential energy and the cloud‚Äôs internal (thermal) kineticenergy. Absent from that calculation was the inclusion of energy due to the presence ofmagnetic Ô¨Åelds. When magnetic Ô¨Åelds are included, the critical mass can be expressed asMB=cBœÄR2BG1/2,(29)wherecB=380 N1/2m‚àí1T‚àí1for a magnetic Ô¨Åeld permeating a spherical, uniform cloud.IfBis expressed in nT andRin units of pc, then Eq.

Extensive use of ‚Äúback-of-the-envelope‚Äù calculations is made throughoutthis text to illustrate the effects of key physical processes..

If the mass of the cloud is less thanMB, the cloud is said to bemagnetically subcriticalandstable against collapse, but if the mass of the cloud exceedsMB, the cloud ismagneticallysupercriticaland the force due to gravity will overwhelm the ability of the magnetic Ô¨Åeldto resist collapse.Example 2.3.For the dense core considered in Examples 2.1 and 2.2, if thedense core has a magnetic Ô¨Åeld of 100 nT threading through it, and if it has a radius of0.1 pc, the magnetic critical mass would beMB‚âÉ70 M‚äô, implying that a dense core ofmass 10 M‚äôwould be stable against collapse. However, ifB=1n T ,t h e nMB‚âÉ0.7M‚äôand collapse would occur.Ambipolar DiffusionThe last example hints at another possibility for triggering the collapse of a dense core. Ifa core that was originally subcritical were to become supercritical, collapse could ensue.This could happen in one of two ways: a group of subcritical clouds could combine to forma supercritical cloud, or the magnetic Ô¨Åeld could be rearranged so that the Ô¨Åeld strength islessened in a portion of the cloud. It appears that both processes may occur, although thelatter process seems to dominate the pre-collapse evolution of most molecular clouds.Recall that only charged particles such as electrons or ions are tied to magnetic Ô¨Åeldlines; neutrals are not affected directly. Given that dense molecular cores are dominated byneutrals, how can magnetic Ô¨Åelds have any substantial effect on the collapse? The answerlies in the collisions between neutrals and the ions (electrons do not signiÔ¨Åcantly affectneutral atoms or molecules through collisions). As neutrals try to drift across magnetic Ô¨Åeldlines, they collide with the ‚Äúfrozen-in‚Äù ions, and the motions of the neutrals are inhibited.However, if there is a net deÔ¨Åned direction for the motion of neutrals due to gravitationalforces, they will still tend to migrate slowly in that direction. This slow migration processis known asambipolar diffusion.To determine the relative impact of ambipolar diffusion, we need to estimate a character-istic timescale for the diffusion process. This is done by comparing the size of the molecularcloud to the time it takes for a neutral to drift across the cloud. It can be shown that thetimescale for ambipolar diffusion is approximatelytAD‚âÉ2Rvdrift‚âÉ10 Gyr/parenleftBignH21010m‚àí3/parenrightBig/parenleftbiggB1 nT/parenrightbigg‚àí2/parenleftbiggR1 pc/parenrightbigg2.(31)Once collapse begins, magnetic Ô¨Åelds can be further altered by undergoing reconnectionevents similar to those of solar Ô¨Çares.Example 2.4.Returning to the dense core we used in previous examples, ifB=1 nTandR=0.1 pc, we Ô¨Ånd from Eq. ( 31) that the timescale for ambipolar diffusion is100 Myr. This is several hundred times longer than the free-fall timescale determined inExample 2.2. Clearly the ambipolar diffusion process can control the evolution of adense core for a long time before free-fall collapse begins.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

Numerical Simulations of Protostellar EvolutionTo investigate the nature of the gravitational collapse of a cloud in detail, we must solve themagnetohydrodynamic equations numerically. Unfortunately, limits in computing powerand numerical methods still necessitate making numerous and signiÔ¨Åcant simplifying as-sumptions. These numerical models do exhibit many of the characteristics that were illus-trated by our crude analytical studies, but other important aspects of the collapse becomeapparent that were not contained in the physics that has already been discussed.8Consider a spherical cloud of approximately 1 M‚äôand solar composition that is super-critical. Initially the early stages of the free-fall collapse are nearly isothermal because lightnear the center of the collapse can travel signiÔ¨Åcant distances before being absorbed by dust.Owing to an initial slight increase in density toward the center of the cloud, the free-falltimescale is shorter near the center and the density increases more rapidly there (inside-outcollapse). When the density of the material near the center of the collapse region reachesapproximately 10‚àí10kg m‚àí3, the region becomes optically thick and the collapse becomesmore adiabatic. The opacity of the cloud at this point is primarily due to the presence of dust.The increased pressure that occurs when the collapse becomes adiabatic substantiallyslows the rate of collapse near the core.At this point the central region is nearly in hydrostaticequilibrium with a radius of approximately 5 AU. It is this central object that is referred toas a protostar.One observable consequence of the cloud becoming optically thick is that the gravita-tional potential energy being released during the collapse is converted into heat and thenradiated away in the infrared as blackbody radiation. By computing the rate of energy re-lease (the luminosity) and the radius of the cloud where the optical depth isœÑ=2/3, theeffective temperature may be determined usin(At this pointinits evolution,the optical depth is determined by the dust, and so the photosphere is adust photosphere.)With the identiÔ¨Åcation of a photosphere, it becomes possible to plot the location ofthe simulated cloud on the H‚ÄìR diagram as a function of time. Curves that depict thelife histories of stars on the H‚ÄìR diagram are known asevolutionary tracks. Figure 9shows theoretical evolutionary tracks of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 M‚äôclouds computedby one research group through the protostar phase. As the collapse continues to accelerateduring the early stages, the luminosity of the protostar increases along with its effectivetemperature.Above the developing protostellar core, material is still in free-fall. When the infallingmaterial meets the nearly hydrostatic core, a shock wave develops where the speed of thematerial exceeds the local sound speed (the material is supersonic). It is at this shock frontthat the infalling material loses a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of its kinetic energy in the form of heatthat ‚Äúpowers‚Äù the cloud and produces much of its luminosity.When the temperature reaches approximately 1000 K, the dust within the developingprotostar begins to vaporize and the opacity drops. This means that the radius whereœÑ=2/3is substantially reduced, approaching the surface of the hydrostatic core. Since the luminos-ity remains high during this phase, a corresponding increase in the effective temperaturemust occur.8Some of the Ô¨Årst calculations of protostellar collapse were performed by Richard Larson in 1969. His pioneeringwork neglected the complicated physics associated with rotation, turbulence, and magnetic Ô¨Åelds but did includethermodynamics, radiative transfer, and other important physical processes.g the following equation:L=4œÄR2œÉT4e.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

Note that the horizontal axisis plotted with effective temperature increasing to the left, as is characteristic of all H‚ÄìR diagrams.(Figure adapted from Wuchterl and Tscharnuter,Astron. Astrophys.,398, 1081, 2003.)As the overlying material continues to fall onto the hydrostatic core, the temperature ofthe core slowly increases. Eventually the temperature becomes high enough (approximately2000 K) to cause the molecular hydrogen to dissociate into individual atoms. This processabsorbs energy that would otherwise provide a pressure gradient sufÔ¨Åcient to maintainhydrostatic equilibrium. As a result, the core becomes dynamically unstable and a secondcollapse occurs. After the core radius has decreased to a value about 30% larger than thepresent size of the Sun, hydrostatic equilibrium is re-established. At this point, the coremass is still much less than its Ô¨Ånal value, implying thataccretionis still ongoing.After the core collapse, a second shock front is established as the envelope continuesto accrete infalling material. When the nearly Ô¨Çat, roughly constant luminosity part of theevolutionary track is reached in Fig. 9, accretion has settled into a quasi-steady mainaccretion phase.

effective temperature decreases slightly. The evolution has now reached a quasi-static pre-main-sequence phase that will be discussed in the next section.The theoretical scenario just described leads to the possibility of observational veriÔ¨Åca-tion. Since it is expected that the collapse should occur deep within a molecular cloud, theprotostar itself would likely be shielded from direct view by a cocoon of dust. Consequently,any observational evidence of the collapse would be in the form of small infrared sourcesembedded within dense cores or Bok globules. The detection of protostellar collapse is mademore difÔ¨Åcult by the relatively small value for the free-fall time, meaning that protostarsare fairly short-lived objects.The search for protostars is under way in infrared and millimeter wavelengths, and anumber of strong candidates have been identiÔ¨Åed, including B335, a Bok globule in theconstellation of Aquila, L1527 in Taurus, and numerous objects in the Orion Nebula. B335is probably the best-studied case and is almost a perfect test of the theory of protostellarcollapse since it seems to have very little turbulence or rotation.Some astronomers believe that by studying the details of the infrared spectra of thesesources, they have been able to identify possible spectral signatures of infalling dust andgas around the embedded infrared objects. These tell-tale features involve Doppler-shiftedsub-structures in the proÔ¨Åles of spectral lines. For an optically thick line, a central absorptionfeature is often visible (see Fig. 10). The source of the absorption feature is cool materialbetween the observer and the source of the line (the hotter central region). The broad wingsof the line result from Doppler-shifted light coming from infalling gas. The blueshifted wingis from infalling gas on the far side of the cloud (therefore moving toward the observer),and the redshifted wing is from infalling gas on the near side of the cloud. Infall has beenidentiÔ¨Åed in starless dense cores as well.

3PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE EVOLUTIONAs we discovered in the last section, once the collapse of a molecular cloud has begun, it ischaracterized by the free-fall timescale given by Eq. ( 26). With the formation of a quasi-static protostar, the rate of evolution becomes controlled by the rate at which the star canthermally adjust to the collapse. This is just the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz timescale;thegravita-potentialenergyliberatedbythecollapseisreleasedovertimeandisthesourceoftheobject‚Äôsluminosity.SincetKH‚â´tff, protostellarevolutionproceedsatamuchslowerratethanfree-fallcollapse.Forinstance,a1M‚äôstarrequiresalmost40Myrtocontractquasi-staticallytoitsmain-sequencestructure.The Hayashi TrackWith the steadily increasing effective temperature of the protostar, the opacity of the outerlayers becomes dominated by the H‚àíion, the extra electrons coming from the partial ioniza-tion of some of the heavier elements in the gas that have lower ionization potentials. As withthe envelope of the main-sequence Sun, this large opacity contribution causes the envelopeof a contracting protostar to become convective. In fact, in some cases the convection zoneextends all the way to the center of the star. In 1961, C. Hayashi demonstrated that becauseof the constraints convection puts on the structure of a star, a deep convective envelopelimits its quasi-static evolutionary path to a line that is nearly vertical in the H‚ÄìR diagram.Consequently, as the protostar collapse slows, its luminosity decreases while its effectivetemperature increases slightly. It is this evolution along theHayashi trackthat appears asthe downward turn at the end of the evolutionary tracks shown in Fig. 9.The Hayashi track actually represents a boundary between ‚Äúallowed‚Äù hydrostatic stel-lar models and those that are ‚Äúforbidden.‚Äù To the right of the Hayashi track, there is nomechanism that can adequately transport the luminosity out of the star at those low effec-tive temperatures; hence no stable stars can exist there. To the left of the Hayashi track,convection and/or radiation is responsible for the necessary energy transport. Note that thisdistinction between allowed and forbidden models is not in conÔ¨Çict with the free-fall evo-lution of collapsing gas clouds found to the right of the Hayashi track since those objectsare far from being in hydrostatic equilibrium.Classical Calculations of Pre-Main-Sequence EvolutionIn 1965, before detailed protostellar collapse calculations were performed, Icko Iben, Jr.computed the Ô¨Ånal stages of collapse onto the main sequence for stars of various masses.In each case he started his models on the Hayashi track. All of those models neglected theeffects of rotation, magnetic Ô¨Åelds, and mass loss. Since that time, signiÔ¨Åcant improvementshave been made in our understanding of the physical processes involved in stellar structureand evolution, including reÔ¨Åned nuclear reaction rates, new opacities, and the inclusionof mass loss or accretion. Some modern evolutionary calculations have also included theeffects of rotation.10Thepre-main-sequence evolutionary tracksfor a sequence of masses1Some calculations have also begun considering the effects of magnetic Ô¨Åelds, but the results presented in thistext do not include those recent preliminary results.0The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

At the point of minimum luminosity in the tracks following the descent along the Hayashi track, the existence of the radiative core allows energy to escape into the convective envelope more readily, causing the luminosity of the star to increase again. Also, the effective temperature continues to increase, since the star is still shrinking.

For stars with masses lower than our Sun‚Äôs, the evolution is somewhat different. Forstars with massesM/lessorsimilar0.5M‚äô(not shown in Fig. 11), the upward branch is missingjust before the main sequence. This happens because the central temperature never getshot enough to burn126C efÔ¨Åcientlyprotostarislessthanapproximately0.072M‚äô,thecoreAnother important difference exists between solar-mass stars and stars of lower massthat can reach the main sequence: Temperatures remain cool enough and the opacity stayssufÔ¨Åciently high in low-mass stars that a radiative core never develops. Consequently, thesestars remain fully convective all the way to the main sequence.The Formation of Brown DwarfsBelow about 0.072 M‚äô, some nuclear burning will still occur, but not at a rate necessary toform a main-sequence star. Above about 0.06 M‚äôthe core temperature of the star is greatenough to burn lithium, and above a mass of approximately 0.013 M‚äôdeuterium burningoccurs (0.013 M‚äôis roughly thirteen times the mass of Jupiter). This last value is alsoinagreementwiththecessationoffragmentationdiscussedThe objects inthe range between about 0.013 M‚äôand 0.072 M‚äôare known asbrown dwarfsand havespectraltypesofLandTTheÔ¨ÅrstconÔ¨Årmeddiscoveryofabrowndwarf,Gliese229B,wasannouncedin1995.Sincethattimehundredsofbrowndwarfshavebeendetected thanks to near-infrared all-sky surveys, such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey(2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Given their very low luminosities anddifÔ¨Åculty of detection, the number of objects found to date suggest that brown dwarfs areprevalent throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.Massive Star FormationFor massive stars, the central temperature quickly becomes high enough to burn126Ca swell as convert11H into32He. This means that these stars leave the Hayashi track at higherluminosities and evolve nearly horizontally across the H‚ÄìR diagram. Because of the muchlarger central temperatures, the full CNO cycle becomes the dominant mechanism for hydro-gen burning in these main-sequence stars. Since the CNO cycle is so strongly temperature-dependent, the core remains convective even after the main sequence is reached.Possible ModiÔ¨Åcations to the Classical ModelsThe general pre-main-sequence evolutionary track calculations described above containnumerous approximations, as already discussed. It is likely that rotation plays an importantrole, along with turbulence and magnetic Ô¨Åelds. It is also likely that the initial environmentscontain inhomogeneities in cloud densities, strong stellar winds, and ionizing radiation fromnearby, massive stars..

These classical models also assume initial structures that are very large, with radii that areeffectively inÔ¨Ånitely greater than their Ô¨Ånal values. Given that dense cores have dimensionson the order of 0.1 pc, the initial radii of clouds undergoing protostellar collapse mustbe much smaller than traditionally assumed. In addition, the assumption of pressure-freeprotostellar collapse may also be a poor one; more realistic calculations probably requirean initial contraction that is quasi-static (after all, the dark cores are roughly in hydrostaticequilibrium).To complicate matters further, the more massive stars also interact with infalling materialin such a way that a feedback loop may develop, limiting the amount of mass that they canaccrete via the classical process discussed to this point; recall the discussion of the Eddingtonlimit.In light of these various complications, some astronomers have suggested that signiÔ¨Å-cant modiÔ¨Åcations to the classical pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks may be required.Theoretical evolutionary sequences beginning with smaller initial radii lead to abirth linewhere protostars Ô¨Årst become visible. This birth line places an upper limit on the observedluminosities of protostars.In addition, some observations suggest that stars with masses greater than about 10 M‚äôor so may not form at all by the classical pre-main-sequence process described above. Thisapparent effect could be due to limiting feedback mechanisms, such as the high luminosityof ionizing radiation associated with high effective temperatures. Instead of the collapse ofsingle protostellar clouds, the more massive stars may form by mergers of smaller stars indense protostellar environments. On the other hand, some researchers have argued that theneed for mergers can be avoided because rotation implies that most of the infalling masscollapses to anaccretion diskthat forms around the star. The accretion disk then feedsthe growing massive star, minimizing the impact of high amounts of ionizing radiation onthe infalling gas and dust.The Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS)The diagonal line in the H‚ÄìR diagram where stars of various masses Ô¨Årst reach the mainsequence and begin equilibrium hydrogen burning is known as thezero-age main sequence(ZAMS). Inspection of the classical results given in Table 1 shows that the amount oftime required for stars to collapse onto the ZAMS is inversely related to mass; a 0.8M‚äôstar takes over 68 Myr to reach the ZAMS, whereas a 60 M‚äôstar makes it to the ZAMS inonly 28,000 years!This inverse relationship between star-formation time and stellar mass may also signala problem with classical pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. The reason is that if themost massive stars do indeed form Ô¨Årst in a cluster of stars, the intense radiation that theyproduce would likely disperse the cloud before their low-mass siblings would ever have achance to develop.Clearly much work remains before we can say that pre-main-sequence stellar evolutionis understood.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

The Initial Mass Function (IMF)From observational studies it is apparent that more low-mass than high-mass stars formwhen an interstellar cloud fragments. This implies that the number of stars that form permass interval per unit volume (or per unit area in the Milky Way‚Äôs disk) is strongly mass-dependent. This functional dependence is known as theinitial mass function(IMF). Onetheoretical estimate of the IMF is shown in Fig. 12. However, a particular IMF dependson a variety of factors, including the local environment in which a cluster of stars formsfrom a given cloud complex in the ISM.As a consequence of the process of fragmentation, most stars form with relatively lowmass. Given the disparity in the numbers of stars formed in different mass ranges, combinedwith the very different rates of evolution, it is not surprising that massive stars are extremelyrare, while low-mass stars are found in abundance. Observations also suggest that althoughthe IMF is quite uncertain below about 0.1M‚äô, rather than falling off sharply as indicatedin Fig. 12, the curve may be fairly Ô¨Çat, resulting in large numbers of low-mass stars andbrown dwarfs.

H II RegionsWhen hot, massive stars reach the ZAMS with O or B spectral types, they do so shroudedin a cloak of gas and dust. The bulk of their radiation is emitted in the ultraviolet portion ofthe electromagnetic spectrum. Those photons that are produced with energies in excess of13.6 eV can ionize the ground-state hydrogen gas (H I) in the ISM that still surrounds thenewly formed star. Of course, if theseH II regionsare in equilibrium, the rate of ionizationmust equal the rate of recombination; photons must be absorbed and ions must be producedat the same rate that free electrons and protons recombine to form neutral hydrogen atoms.When recombination occurs, the electron does not necessarily fall directly to the groundstate but can cascade downward, producing a number of lower-energy photons, many ofwhich will be in the visible portion of the spectrum. The dominant visible wavelengthphoton produced in this way results from the transition betweenn=3 andn=2, the redline of the Balmer series (HŒ±). Consequently, because of this energy cascade, H II regionsappear to Ô¨Çuoresce in red light.Theseemission nebulaeare considered by some to be among the most beautiful objectsin the night sky. One of the more famous H II regions is the Orion nebula (M42), found inthe sword of the Orion constellation. M42 is part of the Orion A complex (see Fig. 13),which also contains a giant molecular cloud (OMC 1) and a very young cluster of stars (theTrapezium cluster). The Ô¨Årst protostar candidates were discovered in this region as well.The size of an H II region can be estimated by considering the requirement of equilib-rium.

If this equilibrium condition did notdevelop, the size of the region would continue to grow as the photons traveled ever fartherbefore encountering un-ionized gas.Next, letŒ±nenHbe the number of recombinationsper unit volume per second, whereŒ±is a quantum-mechanical recombination coefÔ¨Åcient that describes the likelihood that anelectron and a proton can form a hydrogen atom, given their number densities (obviously,the more electrons and protons that are present, the greater the chance of recombination;hence the productnenH).1At about 8000 K, a temperature characteristic of H II regions,Œ±=3.1√ó10‚àí19m3s‚àí1.

The Effects of Massive Stars on Gas CloudsAs a massive star forms, the protostar will initially appear as an infrared source embeddedinside the molecular cloud. With the rising temperature, Ô¨Årst the dust will vaporize, thenthe molecules will dissociate, and Ô¨Ånally, as the star reaches the main sequence, the gasimmediately surrounding it will ionize, resulting in the creation of an H II region inside ofan existing H I region.Now, because of the star‚Äôs high luminosity, radiation pressure will begin to drive sig-niÔ¨Åcant amounts of mass loss, which then tends to disperse the remainder of the cloud.If several O and B stars form at the same time, it may be that much of the mass that hasnot yet become gravitationally bound to more slowly forming low-mass protostars willbe driven away, halting any further star formation. Moreover, if the cloud was originallymarginally bound (near the limit of criticality), the loss of mass will diminish the potentialenergy term in the virial theorem, with the result that the newly formed cluster of stars andprotostars will become unbound (i.e., the stars will tend to drift apart). Figure 14 showssuch a process under way in the Carina Nebula, located approximately 3000 pc from Earth.Another famous example of the effects of ionizing radiation of nearby massive stars is theproduction of the pillars in M16, the Eagle Nebula (Fig. 15).OB AssociationsGroups of stars that are dominated by O and B main-sequence stars are referred to asOBassociations. Studies of their individual kinematic velocities and masses generally leadto the conclusion that they cannot remain gravitationally bound to one another as perma-nent stellar clusters. One such example is the Trapezium cluster in the Orion A complex,believed to be less than 10 million years old. It is currently densely populated with stars

The masses of T Tauri stars rangefrom 0.5 to about 2 M‚äô.Many T Tauri stars exhibit strong emission lines from hydrogen (the Balmer series), fromCa II (the H and K lines), and from iron, as well as absorption lines of lithium. Interestingly,forbidden lines of [O I] and [S II] are also present in the spectra of many T Tauri stars. TheThe Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

(Figure adapted from Bertout,Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys.,27, 351, 1989. Reproducedwith permission from theAnnual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, V olume 27, ¬©1989 byAnnual Reviews Inc.)existence of forbidden lines in a spectrum is an indication of extremely low gas densities.(Note that, to distinguish them from ‚Äúallowed‚Äù lines, forbidden lines are usually indicatedby square brackets, e.g., [O I].)Not only can information be gleaned from spectra by determining which lines are presentand with what strengths, but information is also contained in theshapesof those linesas a function of wavelength.1An important example is found in the shapes of some ofthe lines in T Tauri stars. The HŒ±line often exhibits the characteristic shape shown inFig. 17(a). Superimposed on a rather broad emission peak is an absorption trough at theshort-wavelength edge of the line. This unique line shape is known as aP Cygni proÔ¨Åle,after the Ô¨Årst star observed to have emission lines with blueshifted absorption components.1ecall Fig. 10.4

(a)(b)FIGURE 17(a) A spectral line exhibiting a P Cygni proÔ¨Åle is characterized by a broad emissionpeak with a superimposed blueshifted absorption trough. (b) A P Cygni proÔ¨Åle is produced by anexpanding mass shell. The emission peak is due to the outward movement of material perpendicularto the line of sight, whereas the blueshifted absorption feature is caused by the approaching matter inthe shaded region, intercepting photons coming from the central star.The interpretation given for the existence of P Cygni proÔ¨Åles in a star‚Äôs spectrum is that thestarisexperiencingsigniÔ¨Åcantmassloss.RecallfromKirchhoff‚Äôslawsthatemission lines are produced by a hot, diffuse gas when there is little intervening materialbetween the source and the observer. In this case the emission source is that portion ofthe expanding shell of the T Tauri star that is moving nearly perpendicular to the line ofsight, as illustrated by the geometry shown in Fig. 17(b). Absorption lines are the resultof light passing through a cooler, diffuse gas; the shaded portion of the expanding shellabsorbs the photons emitted by the hotter star behind it. Since the shaded part of the shell(A) is moving toward the observer, the absorption is blueshifted relative to the emissioncomponent (typically by 80 km s‚àí1for T Tauri stars). The mass loss rates of T Tauri starsaverage aboutÀôM=10‚àí8M‚äôyr‚àí1.1In some extreme cases, line proÔ¨Åles of T Tauri stars have gone from P Cygni proÔ¨ÅlestoinverseP Cygni proÔ¨Åles (redshifted absorption) on timescales of days, indicating massaccretion rather than mass loss. Mass accretion rates appear to be on the same order as massloss rates. Apparently the environment around a T Tauri star is very unstable.FU Orionis StarsIn some instances, it appears that T Tauri stars have gone through very signiÔ¨Åcant increasesin mass accretion rates, reaching values on the order ofÀôM=10‚àí4M‚äôyr‚àí1. At the sametime the luminosities of the stars increase by four magnitudes or more, with the increaseslasting for decades. The Ô¨Årst star observed to undergo this abrupt increase in accretion1This value is much higher than the Sun‚Äôs current rate of mass loss (10‚àí14M‚äôyr‚àí1).5

was FU Orionis, for which theFU Orionis starsare named. Apparently, instabilities in acircumstellar accretion disk around an FU Orionis star can result in on the order of 0.01 M‚äôbeing dumped onto the central star over the century or so duration of the outburst. Duringthat time the inner disk can outshine the central star by a factor of 100 to 1000, while strong,high-velocity winds in excess of 300 km s‚àí1occur. It has been suggested that T Tauri starsmay go through several FU Orionis events during their lifetimes.Herbig Ae/Be StarsClosely related to the T-Tauri stars areHerbig Ae/Be stars, named for George Herbig.These pre-main-sequence stars are of spectral types A or B and have strong emission lines(hence the Ae/Be designations). Their masses range from 2 to 10 M‚äôand they tend to beenveloped in some remaining dust and gas. He Ae/Be stars are not as thoroughly studied asT-Tauri stars, in large part because of their much shorter lifetimes (recall Table 1) and inpart because fewer intermediate-mass than lower-mass stars form from a cloud (Fig. 12).Herbig‚ÄìHaro ObjectsAlong with expanding shells, mass loss during pre-main-sequence evolution can also occurfromjetsof gas that are ejected in narrow beams in opposite directions.1Herbig‚ÄìHaroobjects, Ô¨Årst discovered in the vicinity of the Orion nebula in the early 1950s by GeorgeHerbig and Guillermo Haro (1913‚Äì1988), are apparently associated with the jets producedby young protostars, such as T Tauri stars. As the jets expand supersonically into the in-terstellar medium, collisions excite the gas, resulting in bright objects with emission-linespectra. Figure 18(a) shows a Hubble Space Telescope image of the Herbig‚ÄìHaro ob-jects HH 1 and HH 2, which were created by material ejected at speeds of several hundredkilometers per second from a star shrouded in a cocoon of dust. The jets associated withanother Herbig‚ÄìHaro object, HH 47, are shown in Fig. 18(b).Continuous emission is also observed in some protostellar objects and is due to thereÔ¨Çection of light from the parent star.Acircumstellar accretion disk is apparent in Fig. 19around HH 30. The surfaces of the disk are illuminated by the central star, which is againhidden from view behind the dust in the disk. Also apparent are jets originating from deepwithin the accretion disk, possibly from the central star itself. These accretion disks seemto be responsible for many of the characteristics associated with the protostellar objects,including emission lines, mass loss, jets, and perhaps even some of the luminosity variations.Unfortunately, details concerning the physical processes involved are not fully understood.An early model of the production of Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects like HH 1 and HH 2 is shown inFig. 20.Young Stars with Circumstellar DisksObservations have revealed that other young stars also possess circumstellar disks of mate-rial orbiting them. Two well-known examples are Vega andŒ≤Pictoris. An infrared image ofŒ≤Pic and its disk is shown in Fig. 21.Œ≤Pic has also been observed in the ultraviolet linesof Fe II by the Hubble Space Telescope. It appears that clumps of material are falling fromstrophysical jets occur in a variety of phenomena over enormous ranges ofenergy and physical size.6

Larger objects may be forming inthe disk as well, possibly protoplanets. It has been suggested that these disks may in factbedebris disksrather than accretion disks, meaning that the observed material is due tocollisions between objects already formed in the disks.

Lett.,377, L49, 1991.)ProplydsShortly after the December 1993 refurbishment mission of the Hubble Space Telescope,HST made observations of the Orion Nebula. The images in Fig. 23 were obtained usingthe emission lines of HŒ±, [N II], and [O III]. Analysis of the data has revealed that 56 ofthe 110 stars brighter thanV=21 mag are surrounded by disks of circumstellar dust andgas. The circumstellar disks, termedproplyds, appear to be protoplanetary disks associatedwith young stars that are less than 1 million years old. Based on observations of the ionizedmaterial in the proplyds, the disks seem to have masses much greater than 2√ó1025kg (forreference, the mass of Earth is 5.974√ó1024kg).Circumstellar Disk FormationApparently, disk formation is fairly common during the collapse of protostellar clouds.Undoubtedly this is due to the spin-up of the cloud as required by the conservation ofangular momentum. As the radius of the protostar decreases, so does its moment of inertia.This implies that in the absence of external torques, the protostar‚Äôs angular velocity mustincrease. It is left as an exercisetoshowthatbyincludingacentripetalaccelerationterminEq.(19)andrequiringconservationofangularmomentum,thecollapseperpendiculartotheaxisofrotationcanbehaltedbeforethecollapsealongtheaxis,resultingindiskformation.A problem immediately arises when the effect of angular momentum is included in thecollapse.

Apparently the angular momentum isAlong with the problems associated with rotation and magneticÔ¨Åelds, mass loss mayalso play an important role in the evolution of pre-main-sequence stars. Although theseproblems are being investigated, much work remains to be done before we can hope tounderstand all of the details of protostellar collapse and pre-main-sequence evolution.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralKnapp, Gillian,‚ÄúThe Stuff Between the Stars,‚ÄùSky and Telescope, May 1995.Nadis, Steve,‚ÄúSearching for the Molecules of Life in Space,‚ÄùSky and Telescope, January2002.Renyolds, Ronald J.,‚ÄúThe Gas Between the Stars,‚ÄùScientiÔ¨Åc American, January 2002.TechnicalAller, Lawrence H.,Atoms, Stars, and Nebulae, Third Edition, Cambridge University Press,Cambridge, 1991.Dickey, John M., and Lockman, Felix J.,‚ÄúH I in the Galaxy,‚ÄùAnnual Review of Astronomyand Astrophysics,28, 215, 1990.The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation
transferred away from the collapsing star. One suggestion is that magnetic Ô¨Åelds, anchored to convection zones within the stars and coupled to ionized stellar winds, slow the rotation by applying torques. Evidence in support of this idea exists in the form of apparent solar-like coronal activity in the outer atmospheres of many T Tauri stars.

of stars.CThe existence of the main sequence is due to the nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen 
into helium in the cores of stars. In this chapter we will follow the lives of stars as they age, 
beginning on the main sequence. This evolutionary process is an inevitable consequence 
of the relentless force of gravity and the change in chemical composition due to nuclear 
reactions.
To maintain their luminosities, stas must tap sources of energy contained within, either 
nuclear or gravitational.1 Pre-main-sequence evolution is characterized by two basic 
timescales: the free-fall timescale and the thermal Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz timescale. Main-
sequence and post-main-sequence evolution are also governed by a third timescale, 
the timescale of nuclear reactions. The nuclear timescale is on the order of 1010 years for 
the Sun, much longer than the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz timescale of roughly 107 years. It is the
main-sequence stars; we are more likely to Ô¨Ånd stars on the main sequence simply  
because that stage of evolution requires the most time; later stages of evolution pro-
ceed more rapidly. However, as a star switches from one nuclear source to the next,

Width of the Main Sequencerelation are due to a number of factors, including observational errors, differing chemicalcompositions of the individual stars in the study, and varying stages of evolution on themain sequence.Low-Mass Main-Sequence Evolutionhave convective cores due to the highly temperature-dependent CNO cycle. On the otherhand, ZAMS stars with masses less than 1.2M‚äôare dominated by the less temperature-dependent pp chain. This implies that ZAMS stars in the range 0.3M‚äôto 1.2M‚äôpossessradiative cores. However, the lowest-mass ZAMS stars again have convective cores becausetheir high surface opacities drive surface convection zones deep into the interior, makingthe entire star convective.
the pp chain nuclear reaction rate goes asœÅX2T46,the increased tempera-ture and density more than offset the decrease in the mass fraction of hydrogen, and theluminosity of the star slowly increases, along with its radius and effective temperature.Main-sequence and post-main-sequence evolutionary tracks of stars of various masseswere Ô¨Årst computed in a pioneering study by Icko Iben, Jr., and published in the mid-1960s.Modern calculations of theoretical evolutionary tracks that include the effects of convectiveovershooting as well as mass lost from stars during their lifetimes are shown in Fig. 1.2According to the calculations, the amount of time required to evolve from the zero-age mainsequence to points indicated in Fig. 1 are as given in Table 1. The locus of points2Convective overshooting takes into consideration the inertia of a convective bubble, which causes it to travelsome distance into an otherwise radiative region of the star.Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar EvolutionCareful study of the main sequence of an observational H‚ÄìR diagram such as the  observational mass‚Äìluminosity relation reveals that these curves are not simply thin lines but have Ô¨Ånite widths. The widths of the main sequence and the mass‚ÄìluminosityIn this section, we will consider the evolution of stars on the main sequence.  Although all stars on the main sequence are converting hydrogen into helium and, as a result, share similar evolutionary characteristics, differences do exist. For  instance, zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars with masses greater than about 1.2M
Inaddition,sinceFirst consider a typical low-mass main-sequence star such as the Sun. The Sun‚Äôs lumi-nosity, radius, and temperature have all increased steadily since it reached the ZAMS 4.57 Gyr ago. This evolution occurs because, as the pp chain converts hydrogen into helium, the mean molecular weight ¬µ of the coreincreases. According to the ideal gas law, unless the density and/or temperature of the core also increases, there will be insufÔ¨Åcient gas pres-sure to support the overlying layers of the star. As a result, the core must be compressed. While the density of the core increases, gravitational potential energy is released, and, as required by the virial theorem, half of the energy is radiated away and half of the energy goes into increasing the thermal energy and hence the temperature of the gas. One conse-quence of this temperature increase is that the region of the star that is hot enough to un-dergo nuclear reactions increases slightly during the main-sequence phase of evolution.‚äô

As the star‚Äôs evolution on the main sequence continues, eventuallythe hydrogen at its center will be completely depleted. Such a situation is illustrated inFig. 3 fora1M‚äôstar approximately 9.8 Gyr after arriving on the ZAMS; this modelroughly corresponds to point 3 in Fig.With the depletion of hydrogen in the core, the generation of energy via the pp chainmust stop. However, by now the core temperature has increased to the point that nuclearfusion continues to generate energy in a thick hydrogen-burning shell around a small,predominantly helium core. This effect can be seen in the luminosity curve in Fig. 3.

FIGURE 3The interior structure ofa1M‚äôstar near point 3 in Fig. 1, as described by thepioneering calculations of Icko Iben. Although speciÔ¨Åc values of quantities in modern models differsomewhat from those given here, state-of-the-art models do not signiÔ¨Åcantly differ qualitativelyfrom these calculations. The maximum ordinate values of the parameters for the Iben model areR=1.2681 R‚äô,P=1.3146√ó1017Nm‚àí2,T=19.097√ó106K,L=2.1283 L‚äô,XH=0.708,X3=5.15√ó10‚àí3,X12=3.61√ó10‚àí3, andX14=1.15√ó10‚àí2. The radius of the star is 1.3526 R‚äô.(Figure adapted from Iben,Ap. J.,47, 624, 1967.)andTis nearly constant. For an isothermal core to support the material above it in hydrostaticequilibrium, the required pressure gradient must be the result of a continuous increase indensity as the center of the star is approached.At this point, the luminosity being generated in the thick shell actually exceeds what wasproduced by the core during the phase of core hydrogen burning.As a result, the evolutionarytrack continues to rise beyond point 3 in Fig. 1, although not all of the energy generatedreaches the surface; some of it goes into a slow expansion of the envelope. Consequently,the effective temperature begins to decrease slightly and the evolutionary track bends to theright. As the hydrogen-burning shell continues to consume its nuclear fuel, the ash fromnuclear burning causes the isothermal helium core to grow in mass while the star movesfarther to the red in the H‚ÄìR diagram.The Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar LimitThis phase of evolution ends when the mass of the isothermal core has become too greatand the core is no longer capable of supporting the material above it. The maximum fractionof a star‚Äôs mass that can exist in an isothermal core and still support the overlying layerswas Ô¨Årst estimated by M. Sch√∂nberg and Chandrasekhar in 1942; it is given by/parenleftbiggMicM/parenrightbiggSC‚âÉ0.37/parenleftbigg¬µenv¬µic/parenrightbigg2,(1)Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

where¬µenvand¬µicare the mean molecular weights of the overlying envelope and the isother-mal core, respectively. TheSch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limitis another consequence ofthe virial theorem. Based on the physical tools we have developed so far, an approximateform of this result can be obtained. The analysis is presented beginning on the facing page.The maximum fraction of the mass of a star that can be contained in an isothermal coreand still maintain hydrostatic equilibrium is a function of the mean molecular weights of thecore and the envelope. When the mass of the isothermal helium core exceeds this limit, thecore collapses on a Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz timescale, and the star evolves very rapidly relativeto the nuclear timescale of main-sequence evolution. This occurs at the points labeled 4 inFig. 1. For stars below about 1.2M‚äô, this deÔ¨Ånes the end of the main-sequence phase.What happens next is the subject of Section 2.Example 1.1.If a star is formed with the initial compositionX=0.68,Y=0.30, andZ=0.02,andifcompleteionizationisassumedatthecore‚Äìenvelopeboundary,weÔ¨Åndthat¬µenv‚âÉ0.63.Assumingthatallofthehydrogenhasbeenconvertedinto helium in the isothermal core,¬µic‚âÉ1.34.

This canoccur if the electrons in the gas start to becomedegenerate. When the density of a gasstacked into progressively higher energy states, beginning with the ground state. In the caseofcomplete degeneracy, the pressure of the gas is due entirely to the resultant nonthermalmotions of the electrons, and therefore it becomes independent of the temperature of thegas.If the electrons are nonrelativistic, the pressure of a completely degenerate electron gasis given byPe=KœÅ5/3,(2)whereKis a constant.3If the degeneracy is only partial, some temperature dependenceremains. The isothermal core ofa1M‚äôstar between points 3 and 4 in Fig. 1 is partiallydegenerate; consequently, the core mass can reach approximately 13% of the entire mass3Note that Eq.

Less massive stars exhibit even higher levels ofdegeneracy on the main sequence and may not exceed the Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limitat all before the next stage of nuclear burning commences.Main-Sequence Evolution of Massive StarsThe evolution of more massive stars on the main sequence is similar to that of theirlower-mass cousins with one important difference: the existence of a convective core. Thethe nuclear timescale. Fora5M‚äôstar, the central convection zone decreases somewhat inmass during core hydrogen burning, leaving behind a slight composition gradient. Movingup the main sequence, as the star evolves the convection zone in the core retreats morerapidly with increasing stellar mass, disappearing entirely before the hydrogen is exhaustedfor those stars with masses greater than about 10 M‚äô.When the mass fraction of hydrogen reaches aboutX=0.05 in the core ofa5M‚äôstar(point 2 in Fig. 1), the entire star begins to contract. With the release of some gravitationalpotential energy, the luminosity increases slightly. Since the radius decreases, the effectivetemperature must also increase. For stars with masses greater than 1.2M‚äô, this stage ofoverall contraction is deÔ¨Åned to be the end of the main-sequence phase of evolution.A Derivation of the Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limitTo estimate the Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limit, begin by dividing the equation of hydro-staticequilibriumbytheequationofmassconservation.ThisgivesdPdMr=‚àíGMr4œÄr4,(3)which is just the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, written with the interior mass as theindependent variable.

To evaluate Eq. ( 5), we will consider each term separately.

The differencelies in the nonzero pressure boundary condition. Thus Eq.

For our purposes here, however, the assumption of an ideal gas gives reasonable results.5

For speciÔ¨Åc valuesofTicandRic, as the core mass increases, the thermal energy tends to increase the pressureat the surface of the core while the gravitational term tends to decrease it. For some valueofMic,Picis maximized, meaning that there exists an upper limit on how much pressurethe isothermal core can exert in order to support the overlying envelope.To determine whenPicis a maximum, we must differentiate Eq. ( 7) with respect toMicand set the derivative equal to zero. It is left as an exercise to show that the radius ofthe isothermal core for whichPicis a maximum is given byRic=25GMic¬µicmHkTic(8)and that the maximum value of the surface pressure that can be produced by an isothermalcore is given byPic,max=37564œÄ1G3M2ic/parenleftbiggkTic¬µicmH/parenrightbigg4.(9)The important feature of Eq. ( 9) is that, as the core mass increases, the maximumpressure at the surface of the coredecreases. At some point, it may no longer be possible forthe core to support the overlying layers of the star‚Äôs envelope. Clearly this critical conditionmust be related to the mass contained in the envelope and therefore to the total mass of thestar.To estimate the mass that can be supported by the isothermal core, we need to determinethe pressure exerted on the core by the overlying envelope. In hydrostatic equilibrium, thispressure must not exceed the maximum possible pressure that may be supported by theisothermal core. To estimate the envelope pressure, we will start again with Eq.

Our result is only slightly larger than the one obtained originally by Sch√∂nberg and Chan-drasekhar (Eq. 1).2LATE STAGES OF STELLAR EVOLUTIONFollowing the completion of the main-sequence phase of stellar evolution, a complicatedsequence of evolutionary stages occurs that may involve nuclear burning in the cores ofstars together with nuclear burning in concentric mass shells. At various times, core burningand/or nuclear burning in a mass shell may cease, accompanied by a readjustment of thestructure of the star. This readjustment may involve expansion or contraction of the coreor envelope and the development of extended convection zones. As the Ô¨Ånal stages ofevolution are approached, extensive mass loss from the surface also plays a critical role indetermining the star‚Äôs ultimate fate.As examples of post-main-sequence stellar evolution, we will continue to explorechanges in the structures over time of alow-mass starof 1 M‚äôand anintermediate-massstarof 5 M‚äô. Detailed depictions of their evolutionary tracks in the H‚ÄìR diagram areshown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.Evolution Off the Main SequenceAs mentioned in Section 1, the end of the main-sequence phase of evolution occurs whenhydrogen burning ceases in the core of the star (in Fig. 1 this corresponds to point 3 forthe 1 M‚äôstar and point 2 for the 5 M‚äôstar). In the case of the 1 M‚äôstar, the core beginsto contract while a thick hydrogen-burning shell continues to consume available fuel. Withthe rising temperature in the shell due to core contraction, the shell actually produces moreenergy than the core did on the main sequence, causing the luminosity to increase, theenvelope to expand slightly, and the effective temperature to decrease.The situation is somewhat different for the 5 M‚äôstar, however. Rather than a thickhydrogen-burning shell immediately producing energy with the cessation of hydrogen burn-ing in the core, the entire star participates in an overall contraction on a Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtztimescale. This contraction phase releases gravitational potential energy, causing the lumi-nosity to increase slightly, the radius of the star to decrease, and the effective temperatureto increase (corresponding to the evolution between points 2 and 3 in Fig. 1). Eventuallythe temperature outside the helium core increases sufÔ¨Åciently to cause a thick shell of hy-drogen to burn (point 3 in Fig. 1). At this point the interior chemical composition of the5M‚äôstar resembles that of Fig. 6. Because the ignition of the shell is quite rapid, theoverlying envelope is forced to expand slightly, absorbing some of the energy released bythe shell. As a result, the luminosity decreases momentarily and the effective temperaturedrops, as can be seen in both Figs. 1 and 5. A sketch of the star‚Äôs structure at this pointis given in Fig. 7.The Subgiant BranchFor both low- and intermediate-mass stars, as the shell continues to consume the hydrogenthat is available at the base of the star‚Äôs envelope, the helium core steadily increases in massMain Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

At points 4 in Fig. 1, the Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekharlimit is reached and the core begins to contract rapidly, causing the evolution to proceedon the much faster Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz timescale. The gravitational energy released by therapidly contracting core again causes the envelope of the star to expand and the effec-tive temperature cools, resulting in redward evolution on the H‚ÄìR diagram. This phase ofevolution is known as thesubgiant branch(SGB).As the core contracts, a nonzero temperature gradient is soon re-established becauseof the release of gravitational potential energy.

The result isthat a convection zone develops near the surface for both low- and intermediate-mass stars.As the evolution continues toward points 5 in Fig. 1, the base of the convection zoneextends deep into the interior of the star. With the nearly adiabatic temperature gradientassociated with convection throughout much of the stellar interior, and the efÔ¨Åciency withwhich the energy is transported to the surface, the star begins to rise rapidly upward alongthered giant branch(RGB) of the H-R diagram. This path is essentially the same onefollowed by pre-main-sequence stars descending the Hayashi track prior to the onset ofcore hydrogen burning.As the star climbs the RGB, its convection zone deepens until the base reaches downinto regions where the chemical composition has been modiÔ¨Åed by nuclear processes.In particular, because of its rather large nuclear reaction cross section, lithium burns viacollisions with protons at relatively cool temperatures (greater than about 2.7√ó106K).This means that because of the evolution of the star to this point, lithium has become nearlyMain Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

When the surface convection zone encountersthis chemically modiÔ¨Åed region, the processed material becomes mixed with the materialabove it. The effect is observable changes in the composition of the photosphere; the amountof lithium at the surface will decrease and the amount of32He will increase. At the sametime, convection transports126C inward and147N outward, decreasing the observable ratio ofX12/X14. Other abundance ratios such asX‚Ä≤13/X12will also be modiÔ¨Åed. This transport ofmaterials from the deep interior to the surface is referred to as theÔ¨Årst dredge-upphase.Nature has provided us with an opportunity to directly observe the products of nuclearreactions deep within stellar interiors.

The result is an abrupt decrease in the luminosity of the star. At the same time,the envelope contracts and the effective temperature begins to increase again.The Helium Core FlashAn interesting difference arises at this point between the evolution of stars with massesgreater than about 1.8M‚äôand those that have masses less than 1.8M‚äô. For stars of lowermass, as the helium core continues to collapse during evolution up to the tip of the red giantbranch, the core becomes strongly electron-degenerate. Furthermore, signiÔ¨Åcant neutrinolosses from the core of the star prior to reaching the tip of the RGB result in a negativetemperature gradient near the center (i.e., a temperature inversion develops); the core isactually refrigerated somewhat because of the energy that is carried away by the easilyescaping neutrinos! When the temperature and density become high enough to initiate thetriple alpha process (approximately 108K and 107kg m‚àí3, respectively), the ensuing energyrelease is almost explosive. The ignition of helium burning occurs initially in a shell aroundthe center of the star, but the entire core quickly becomes involved and the temperatureinversion is lifted. The luminosity generated by the helium-burning core reaches 1011L‚äô,comparable to that of an entire galaxy! However, this tremendous energy release lasts forhe surface abundance of lithium is also lower than expected in the present-daySun.6

only a few seconds, and most of the energy never even reaches the surface. Instead, itis absorbed by the overlying layers of the envelope, possibly causing some mass to belost from the surface of the star. This short-lived phase of evolution of low-mass stars isreferred to as thehelium core Ô¨Çash. The origin of the explosive energy release is in the veryweak temperature dependence of electron degeneracy pressure and the strong temperaturedependence of the triple alpha process. The energy generated must Ô¨Årst go into ‚Äúlifting‚Äù thedegeneracy. Only after this occurs can the energy go into thermal (kinetic) energy requiredto expand the core, which decreases the density, lowers the temperature, and slows thereaction rate.It is because of the very rapid pace of the helium core Ô¨Çash that stellar evolution cal-culations of low-mass stars are often terminated at that point. Given the dramatic changesoccuring deep in the interior of the star, it is very difÔ¨Åcult to follow the evolution adequately;very small time steps are required to model the evolution, meaning that a great deal of com-puter time is needed to follow a star through the helium core Ô¨Çash (in fact, the star evolvesmuch fasterthan the computer can model it). This is why the evolutionary tracks of starswith masses of 1, 1.25, and 1.5M‚äôare not followed past points 6 in Fig. 1. This isalso why the annotated evolutionary track in Fig. 4 immediately following the red gianttip is indicated by a dotted line; the evolution is extremely rapid and the computations areresumed when quiescent helium core burning and hydrogen shell burning are establishedin the star.The Horizontal BranchFor both low- and intermediate-mass stars, as the envelope of the model contracts followingthe red giant tip, the increasing compression of the hydrogen-burning shell eventually causesthe energy output of the shell, and the overall energy output of the stars, to begin to riseagain. With the associated increase in effective temperature, the deep convection zone inthe envelope rises toward the surface, while at the same time, a convective core develops.The appearance of a convective core is due to the high temperature sensitivity of the triplealpha process (just as the convective core of an upper-main-sequence star arises because ofthe temperature dependence of the CNO cycle). This generally horizontal evolution is theblueward portion of thehorizontal branch(HB) loop. The blueward portion of the HB isessentially the helium-burning analog of the hydrogen-burning main sequence, but with amuch shorter timescale.When the evolution of the star reaches its most blueward point (point 8 in Fig. 1 forthe 5 M‚äôstar), the mean molecular weight of the core has increased to the point that thecore begins to contract, accompanied by the expansion and cooling of the star‚Äôs envelope.Shortly after beginning the redward portion of the HB loop, the core helium is exhausted,having been converted to carbon and oxygen. Again the redward evolution proceeds rapidlyas the inert CO core contracts, much like the rapid evolution across the SGB following theextinction of core hydrogen burning.During their passage along the horizontal branch, many stars develop instabilities in theirouter envelopes, leading to periodic pulsations that are readily observable as variations inluminosity, temperature, radius, and surface radial velocity.

sensitively on the internal structure of the star, stellar pulsations provide yet another test ofstellar structure theory.With the increase in core temperature associated with its contraction, a thick helium-burning shell develops outside the CO core. As the core continues to contract, the helium-burning shell narrows and strengthens, forcing the material above the shell to expand andcool. This results in a temporary turn-off of the hydrogen-burning shell.Along with the contraction of the helium-exhausted core, neutrino production increasesto the point that the core cools a bit. As a consequence of the increasing central density anddecreasing temperature, electron degeneracy pressure becomes an important component ofthe total pressure in the carbon‚Äìoxygen core.The Early Asymptotic Giant BranchThe next phase of the evolution illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 is very similar to the evolu-tion following the exhaustion of the hydrogen-burning cores. When the redward evolutionreaches the Hayashi track, the evolutionary track bends upward along a path referred toas theasymptotic giant branch(AGB). (The AGB is so named because the evolutionarytrack approaches the line of the RGB asymptotically from the left. The AGB may be thoughtof as the helium-burning-shell analog to the hydrogen-burning-shell RGB.) At this pointin its evolution the core temperature of the 5 M‚äôstar is approximately 2√ó108K, andits density is on the order of 109kg m‚àí3. A diagram of anearlyAGB(E-AGB) star withtwo shell sources is shown in Fig. 8. Although two shell sources are depicted, it is thehelium-burning shell that dominates the energy output during the E-AGB; the hydrogen-burning shell is nearly inactive at this point. Note that the diagram is not to scale; in orderto visualize the structure from the hydrogen-burning shell inward, that region was enlargedby a factor of 100 relative to the surface of the star.The expanding envelope initially absorbs much of the energy produced by the helium-burning shell. As the effective temperature continues to decrease, the convective envelopedeepens again, this time extending downward to the chemical discontinuity between thehydrogen-rich outer layer and the helium-rich region above the helium-burning shell. Themixing that results during thissecond dredge-upphase increases the helium and nitrogencontent of the envelope. (The increase in nitrogen is due to the previous conversion ofcarbon and oxygen into nitrogen in the intershell region.)The Thermal-Pulse Asymptotic Giant BranchNear the upper portion of the AGB (labeled TP-AGB in Figs. 4 and 5 forthermal-pulseAGB), the dormant hydrogen-burning shell eventually reignites and again dominatesthe energy output of the star. However, during this phase of evolution, the narrowing helium-burning shell begins to turn on and off quasi-periodically. These intermittenthelium shellÔ¨Çashesoccur because the hydrogen-burning shell is dumping helium ash onto the heliumlayer below. As the mass of the helium layer increases, its base becomes slightly degenerate.Then, when the temperature at the base of the helium shell increases sufÔ¨Åciently, a heliumMain Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

Note that relative to the surface radius, the scale of the shellsand core has been increased by a factor of 100 for clarity. (Data from Iben,Ap. J.,143, 483, 1966.)shell Ô¨Çash occurs, analogous to the earlier helium core Ô¨Çashes of low-mass stars (althoughmuch less energetic). This drives the hydrogen-burning shell outward, causing it to cooland turn off for a time. Eventually the burning in the helium shell diminishes, the hydrogen-burning shell recovers, and the process repeats. The period between pulses is a functionof the mass of the star, ranging from thousands of years for stars near 5 M‚äôto hundredsof thousands of years for low-mass stars (0.6M‚äô), with the pulse amplitude growing witheach successive event; see Fig. 9. This phase of periodic activity in the deep interior ofthe star is evident in abrupt changes in luminosity at the surface (see the TP-AGB phasesin Figs. 4 and 5).Details of thermal pulses fora7M‚äôstar are shown in Fig. 10. Following a heliumshell Ô¨Çash, the luminosity arising from the hydrogen-burning shell drops appreciably whilethe energy output from the helium-burning shell increases. This is because the hydrogen-burning shell is pushed outward, causing it to cool. Since the hydrogen-burning shell isresponsible for most of the energy output of the star, the star‚Äôs luminosity abruptly decreaseswhen a helium shell Ô¨Çash occurs. At the same time, the radius of the surface of the star alsodecreases and the star‚Äôs effective temperature increases. After a period of time, the energyoutput of the helium shell diminishes when the degeneracy is lifted, the hydrogen-burningshell moves deeper into the star, and the hydrogen-burning shell once again dominatesthe star‚Äôs total energy output. As a result, the surface radius, luminosity, and effectivetemperature relax back to near their pre-Ô¨Çash values.

The quantities shown are the surface radius (RS), the interior massfractions of the base of the convective envelope (MCE) and the hydrogen‚Äìhelium discontinuity (MXY),the star‚Äôs luminosity and effective temperature (LsandTe, respectively), and the luminosities of thehydrogen- and helium-burning shells (LHandLHe, respectively).

For stars that are massive enough (M>2M‚äô), the convection zones will merge and eventually extend down into regions wherecarbon has been synthesized. In the region between the hydrogen- and helium-burningshells, the abundance of carbon exceeds that of oxygen by a factor of Ô¨Åve to ten. This isin sharp contrast to the general excess of oxygen over carbon in the atmospheres of moststars. During thisthird dredge-upphase, the carbon-rich material is brought to the surface,decreasing the ratio of oxygen to carbon. If there are multiple third dredge-up events arisingfrom repeated helium shell Ô¨Çashes, the oxygen-rich spectrum of a star will transform overtime to a carbon-rich spectrum. This appears to explain the difference, observed spectro-scopically, between oxygen-rich giants where the number density of oxygen atoms in theatmosphere exceeds the number density of carbon atoms (NO>NC) and carbon-rich giants(NC>NO) calledcarbon stars.Carbon stars are designated with a specialC spectral type(overlapping the traditionalK and M types). These stars are distinguished by an abundance of carbon-rich moleculesin their atmospheres, such as SiC, rather than SiO of typical M stars. This occurs becausecarbon monoxide (CO) is a very tightly bound molecule. If the atmosphere of the starcontains more oxygen than carbon, the carbon is almost completely tied up in CO, leavingoxygen to form additional molecules. Conversely, if the atmosphere contains more carbonthan oxygen, the oxygen is tied up in CO, allowing carbon to form in molecules.Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

Intermediate between the M and C spectral types are theS spectral typestars. These starsshow ZrO lines in their atmospheres, having replaced the TiO lines of M stars. S stars havealmost identical abundances of carbon and oxygen in their atmospheres.Of particular interest in the atmospheres of evolved TP-AGB stars is the presence oftechnetium (Tc), an element with no stable isotopes. In particular,9943Tc is the most abundantisotope of technetium found in the atmospheres of TP-AGB stars, yet it has a half-life ofonly 200,000 yr. The existence of technetium in S and C stars strongly suggests that theisotope must have been formed very recently in the star‚Äôs history and dredged up to thesurface from the deep interior.s-Process Nucleosynthesiscollide with nuclei (there is no Coulomb barrier to tunnel through). If the Ô¨Çux of neutronsis not too great, radioactive nuclei produced by the absorption of stray neutrons have timeto decay into other nuclei before they absorb another neutron.9943Tc is one product of thisslows-processnucleosynthesis.Mass Loss and AGB EvolutionAGB stars are known to lose mass at a rapid rate, sometimes as high asÀôM‚àº10‚àí4M‚äôyr‚àí1.The effective temperatures of these stars are also quite cool (around 3000 K).As a result, dustgrains form in the expelled matter. Since silicate grains tend to form in an environment rich inoxygen, and graphite grains will form in a carbon-rich environment, the composition of theISM may be related to the relative numbers of carbon- and oxygen-rich stars. Observationsof ultraviolet extinction curves in the Milky Way and the Large and Small MagellanicClouds support the idea that mass loss from these stars does, in fact, help enrich the ISM.As evolution up the AGB continues, what happens next is strongly dependent on theoriginal mass of the star and the amount of mass loss experienced by that star during itslifetime. It appears that the Ô¨Ånal evolutionary behavior of stars can be separated into twobasic groups: those with ZAMS masses above about 8 M‚äôand those with masses belowthis value. The distinction between the two mass regimes is based on whether or not thecore of the star will undergo signiÔ¨Åcant further nuclear burning. In the remainder of thissection, we will consider the Ô¨Ånal evolution of stars with initial masses less than 8 M‚äôAs stars with initial masses below 8 M‚äôcontinue to evolve up the AGB, the helium-burning shell converts more and more of the helium into carbon and then into oxygen,increasing the mass of the carbon‚Äìoxygen core. At the same time, the core continues tocontract slowly, causing its central density to increase. Depending on the star‚Äôs mass, neu-trino energy losses may decrease the central temperature somewhat during this phase. Inany event, the densities in the core become large enough that electron degeneracy pressureThe LMC and the SMC are small satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, visible in the southern hemisphere.7.

begins to dominate. This situation is very similar to the development of an electron-degenerate helium core in a low-mass star during its rise up the red giant branch.For stars with ZAMS masses less than about 4 M‚äô, the carbon‚Äìoxygen core will neverbecome large enough and hot enough to ignite nuclear burning. On the other hand,if theimportant contribution of mass loss is ignoredfor stars between 4 M‚äôand 8 M‚äô, theorysuggests that the C‚ÄìO core would reach a sufÔ¨Åciently large mass that it could no longerremain in hydrostatic equilibrium, even with the assistance of pressure from the degenerateelectron gas. The outcome of this situation is catastrophic core collapse. The maximumvalue of 1.4M‚äôfor a completely degenerate core is known as theChandrasekhar limit.However, as has already been mentioned, observations of AGB stars do show enormousmass loss rates. When these mass loss rates are included in evolution calculations on theAGB, the situation described in the last paragraph does not actually occur. Instead, forstars between 4 M‚äôand 8 M‚äô, mass loss prevents catastrophic core collapse. Instead ofcollapse, these stars experience additional nucleosynthesis in their cores, leading to corecompositions of oxygen, neon, and magnesium (ONeMg cores) and masses remainingbelow the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4M‚äô.In addition, reactions such as2210Ne+42He‚Üí2512Mg+n2210Ne+42He‚Üí2612Mg+Œ≥also affect the composition of these cores.Unfortunately, our understanding of the mechanism(s) that cause this mass loss is poor.Some astronomers have suggested that the mass loss may be linked to the helium shell Ô¨Çashesor perhaps to the periodic envelope pulsations of LPVs. Other proposed mechanisms stemfrom the high luminosities and low surface gravities of these stars, coupled with radiationpressure on the dust grains, dragging the gas with them. Whatever the cause, its inÔ¨Çuenceon the evolution of AGB stars is signiÔ¨Åcant.As one might expect, the rate of mass loss accelerates with time because the luminosityand radius are increasing while the mass is decreasing during continued evolution up theAGB. The decreasing mass and increasing radius of the star imply that the surface gravityis also decreasing, and the surface material is becoming progressively less tightly bound.Consequently, mass loss becomes increasingly more important asAGB evolution continues.In the latest stages of evolution on the AGB, asuperwinddevelops withÀôM‚àº10‚àí4M‚äôyr‚àí1. Whether shell Ô¨Çashes, envelope pulsations, or some other mechanismis the reason, the observed high mass loss rates seem to be responsible for the existenceof a class of objects known asOH/IR sources. These objects appear to be stars shroudedin optically thick dust clouds that radiate their energy primarily in the infrared part of theelectromagnetic spectrum.The OH part of the OH/IR designation is due to the detection of OH molecules, whichcan be seen via theirmaser emission.

As a result, the cloud appears to glow in visible light.1The bluish-green coloration of many planetary nebulae is due to the 500.68-nm and495.89-nm forbidden lines of [O III] (forbidden lines of [O II] and [Ne III] are also com-mon), and the reddish coloration comes from ionized hydrogen and nitrogen. Characteristictemperatures of these objects are in the range of the ionization temperature of hydrogen,104K.With the advent of high-resolution images of planetary nebulae obtained by telescopessuch as the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have come to realize that the morphologiesof planetary nebulae are often much more complex than might have been expected ofa spherically symmetric parent TP-AGB star. Some planetaries, like the Helix nebula inFig. 13(a), look as though they have a ringlike structure. This is because gas is ejectedpreferentially along the equator of the star due to the presence of angular momentum, andour viewing angle is down the star‚Äôs rotation axis. Suggestions for the surprising array ofstructures include varying viewing angles, multiple ejections of material from the stellarsurface, the presence of one or more companion stars, and magnetic Ô¨Åelds.1This process is reminiscent of the creation of H II regions around newly formed O and B main-sequence stars1

Figure 13(b) shows so-calledcometary knots that are pointed radially away from the central star in the Helix nebula.These clumps of material have dark cores with luminous cusps on the sides facing the star.The expansion velocities of planetaries, as measured by Doppler-shifted spectral lines,show that the gas is typically moving away from the central stars with speeds of between10 and 30 km s‚àí1, although much greater speeds have been measured, as in the case ofMz 3 [Fig. 15(b)]. Combined with characteristic length scales of around 0.3 pc, theirestimated ages are on the order of 10,000 years. After only about 50,000 years, a planetarynebula will dissipate into the ISM. Compared with the entire lifetime of a star, the phase ofplanetary nebula ejection is Ô¨Çeeting indeed.Despite their short lifetimes, roughly 1500 planetary nebulae are known to exist in theMilky Way Galaxy.

Earth, it is estimated that the number of planetaries is probably close to 15,000. If, onaverage, each planetary contains about 0.5M‚äôof material, the ISM is being enriched at therate of roughly one solar mass per year through this process.3STELLAR CLUSTERSOver the past two chapters we have seen a story develop that depicts the lives of stars. Theyare formed from the ISM, only to return most of that material to the ISM through stellarwinds, by the ejection of planetary nebulae, or via supernova explosionsThe matter that is given back, however, has been enriched with heavierelements that were produced through the various sequences of nuclear reactions governinga star‚Äôs life. As a result, when the next generation of stars is formed, it possesses higherconcentrations of these heavy elements than did its ancestors. This cyclic process of starformation, death, and rebirth is evident in the variations in composition between stars.Population I, II, and III StarsThe universe began with the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. At that time hydrogen andhelium were essentially the only elements produced by the nucleosynthesis that occurredduring the initial Ô¨Åreball. Consequently, the Ô¨Årst stars to form did so with virtually no metalcontent;Z=0. The next generation of stars that formed were extremelymetal-poor, havingvery low but non-zero values ofZ. Each succeeding generation of star production resultedin higher and higher proportions of heavier elements, leading to metal-rich stars for whichZmay reach values as high as 0.03. The (thus far hypothetical) original stars that formedimmediately after the Big Bang are referred to asPopulation IIIstars, metal-poor starswithZ/greaterorsimilar0 are referred to asPopulation II, and metal-rich stars are calledPopulation I.The classiÔ¨Åcations of Population II and Population I are due originally to their identi-Ô¨Åcations with kinematically distinct groups of stars within our Galaxy. Population I starshave velocities relative to the Sun that are low compared to Population II stars. Furthermore,Population I stars are found predominantly in the disk of the Milky Way, while Population IIstars can be found well above or below the disk. It was only later that astronomers realizedthat these two groups of stars differed chemically as well. Not only do populations tell ussomething about evolution, but the kinematic characteristics, positions, and compositionsof Population I and Population II stars also provide us with a great deal of information aboutthe formation and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy.Globular Clusters and Galactic (Open) Clustersuring the collapse of a molecular cloud,stellar clusterscanform, ranging in size from tens of stars to hundreds of thousands of stars. Every memberof a given cluster formed from the same cloud, they all formed with essentially identicalcompositions, and they all formed within a relatively short period of time. Thus, excludingsuch effects as rotation, magnetic Ô¨Åelds, and membership in a binary star system, the V ogt‚ÄìRussell theorem suggests that the differences in evolutionary states between the variousstars in the cluster are due solely to their initial masses..

(b) The Pleiades is a galactic clusterfound in the constellation of Taurus, at a distance of 130 pc. (Courtesy of the National OpticalAstronomical Observatories.)Extreme Population II clusters formed when the Galaxy was very young, making themsome of the oldest objects in the Milky Way. They also contain the largest number of mem-bers. Figure 16(a) shows M13, one suchglobular cluster, located in the constellation ofHercules. Population I clusters, such as the Pleiades [Fig. 16(b)], tend to be smaller andyounger. These smaller clusters are called alternatelygalactic clustersoropen clusters.Spectroscopic ParallaxThe H‚ÄìR diagrams of clusters can be constructed in a self-consistent way without knowledgeof the exact distances to them. Since the dimensions of a typical cluster are small relativeto its distance from Earth, little error is introduced by assuming that each member of thecluster has the same distance modulus. As a result, plotting the apparent magnitude ratherthan the absolute magnitude only amounts to shifting the position of each star in the diagramvertically by the same amount. By matching the observational main sequence of the clusterto a main sequence calibrated in absolute magnitude, the distance modulus of the clustercan be determined, giving the cluster‚Äôs distance from the observer. This method of distancedetermination is known asspectroscopic parallax(the method is also often referred to asmain-sequence Ô¨Åtting).Color‚ÄìMagnitude DiagramsRather than attempting to determine the effective temperature of every member of a clusterby undertaking a detailed spectral line analysis of each star (which would be a major projectfor a globular cluster, even assuming that the stars were bright enough to get good spectra),it is much faster to determine their color indices (B‚àíV). With knowledge of the apparentmagnitude and the color index of each star, acolor‚Äìmagnitude diagramcan be constructed.Color‚Äìmagnitude diagrams for M3 (a globular cluster) and h andœáPersei (adoublegalacticcluster) are shown in Figs. 17 and 18, respectively.Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

By computing the evolutionary tracks of stars of variousmasses, all having the same composition as the cluster, it is possible to plot the position ofeach evolving model on the H‚ÄìR diagram when the model reaches the age of the cluster.(The curve connecting these positions is known as anisochrone.) The relative number ofstars at each location on the isochrone depends on the number of stars in each mass rangeAs the cluster ages, beginning with the initial collapse of the molecular cloud, the mostmassive and least abundant stars will arrive on the main sequence Ô¨Årst, evolving rapidly.Before the lowest-mass stars have even reached the main sequence, the most massiveones have already evolved into the red giant region, perhaps even undergoing supernovaexplosions.Since core hydrogen-burning lifetimes are inversely related to mass, continued evolutionof the cluster means that the main-sequenceturn-off point, deÔ¨Åned as the point where starsMain Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

Consequently, it is possible to estimate the age of a cluster by the location ofthe uppermost point of its main sequence. This fundamental technique is an important toolfor determining ages of stars, clusters, our Milky Way Galaxy, and other galaxies withobservable clusters, and even for establishing a lower limit on the age of the universe itself.A composite color‚Äìmagnitude diagram of a number of clusters is shown in Fig. 19.Labeled vertically on the right-hand side is the age of the cluster corresponding to thelocation of the main-sequence turn-off point.The Hertzsprung GapAnother consequence of varying timescales can be seen in the color‚Äìmagnitude diagramof h andœáPersei (Fig. 18). Apparent are red giants, together with low-mass pre-main-sequence stars. Also evident in the diagram is the complete absence of stars between themassive ones that are just leaving the main sequence and the few in the red giant region. It isunlikely that this represents an incomplete survey, since these stars are the brightest membersof the cluster. Rather, it points out the very rapid evolution that occurs just after leaving themain sequence. This feature, known as theHertzsprung gap, is a common characteristic ofthe color‚Äìmagnitude diagrams of young, galactic clusters. The existence of the Hertzsprunggap is due to evolution on a Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz timescale across the SGB, following thepoint when the hydrogen-depleted core exceeds the Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limit.Notice in Fig. 19 that the cluster M67 does not show the existence of the Hertzsprunggap; the same can be said of M3 (Fig. 17).

This is just a consequence of the very rapid pace ofevolution during this phase of heavy mass loss that leads directly to the formation of whitedwarfs.Blue StragglersIt should be pointed out that a group of stars, known asblue stragglers, can be foundabove the turn-off point of M3. Although our understanding of these stars is incomplete, itappears that their tardiness in leaving the main sequence is due to some unusual aspect oftheir evolution.

A Work in ProgressThe successful comparisons between theory and observation that are provided by stellarclusters give strong support to the idea that our picture of stellar evolution is fairly complete,although perhaps in need of some Ô¨Åne-tuning. Continued reÔ¨Ånements in stellar opacities,revisions in nuclear reaction cross sections, and much-needed improvements in the treatmentof convection will probably lead to even better agreement with observations. However, muchfundamental work remains to be done as well, such as developing a better understanding ofthe effects of mass loss, rotation, magnetic Ô¨Åelds, and the presence of a close companion.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralBalick, B., et al., ‚ÄúThe Shaping of Planetary Nebulae,‚ÄùSky and Telescope, February 1987.Harpaz, Amos, ‚ÄúThe Formation of a Planetary Nebula,‚ÄùThe Physics Teacher, May 1991.Kwok, Sun,Cosmic ButterÔ¨Çies: The Colorful Mysteries of Planetary Nebulae, CambridgeUniversity Press, Cambridge, 2001.The Space Telescope Science Institute,http://www.stsci.eduTechnicalAller, Lawrence H.,Atoms, Stars, and Nebulae, Third Edition, Cambridge University Press,Cambridge, 1991.Ashman, Keith M., and Zepf, Stephen E.,Globular Cluster Systems, Cambridge UniversityPress, Cambridge, 1998.Busso, M., Gallino, R., and Wasserburg, G.

6In an attempt to identify the important components of AGB mass loss, various researchers haveproposed parameterizations of the mass loss rate that are based on Ô¨Åtting observed rates for aspeciÔ¨Åed set of stars with some general equation that includes measurable quantities associatedwith the stars in the sample. One of the most popular, developed by D. Reimers, is given byÀôM=‚àí4√ó10‚àí13Œ∑LgRM‚äôyr‚àí1(13)Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution: Problem Set.

(13) in the way they do.(b)Estimate the mass loss rate ofa1M‚äôAGB star that has a luminosity of 7000 L‚äôand atemperature of 3000 K.7 (a)Show that the Reimers mass loss rate, given by Eq. (13) in Problem 6, can also bewritten in the formÀôM=‚àí4√ó10‚àí13Œ∑LRMM‚äôyr‚àí1,whereL,R, andMare all in solar units.(b)Assuming (incorrectly) thatL,R, andŒ∑do not change with time, derive an expression forthe mass of the star as a function of time. LetM=M0when the mass loss phase begins.(c)UsingL=7000 L‚äô,R=310 R‚äô,M0=1M‚äô, andŒ∑=1, make a graph of the star‚Äôsmass as a function of time.(d)How long would it take for a star with an initial mass of 1 M‚äôto be reduced to the massof the degenerate carbon‚Äìoxygen core (0.6M‚äô)?8The Helix nebula is a planetary nebula with an angular diameter of 16‚Ä≤that is located approx-imately 213 pc from Earth.(a)Calculate the diameter of the nebula.(b)Assuming that the nebula is expanding away from the central star at a constant velocity of20 km s‚àí1, estimate its age.9An old version of stellar evolution, popular at the beginning of the twentieth century, maintainedthat stars begin their lives as large, cool spheres of gas, like the giant stars on the H‚ÄìR diagram.They then contract and heat up under the pull of their own gravity to become hot, bright blueO stars. For the remainder of their lives they lose energy, becoming dimmer and redder withage. As they slowly move down the main sequence, they eventually end up as cool, dim redM stars. Explain how observations of stellar clusters, plotted on an H‚ÄìR diagram, contradictthis idea.10 (a)Using data available in the tables below, compare the pre-main sequence evolutionarytime of a 0.8M‚äôstar with the lifetime on the main sequence for a 15 M‚äôstar. How doesthis information help to explain the appearance of a color‚Äìmagnitude diagram such asFig. 18?Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution: Problem Set

Woosley (sometimes also referred to as a hypernova model). Neutron stars have an upper mass limit based on the ability of neutron degeneracy to support the extremely compact star (similar to electron degeneracy pressure). Using sophisticated equations of state for neutrons at very high densities , investigators have estimated that the maximum mass of a nonrotating neutron star is about 2.2 M  . When a core-collapse  supernova occurs, either a neutron star or a black hole will form, depending on the mass, metallicity, and rotation of the progenitor star. Woosley‚Äôs models have suggested that for a progenitor star with sufÔ¨Åciently great mass (possibly a Wolf‚ÄìRayet star), the central object to form will be a black hole with a debris disk surrounding it. The collimating effect of the debris disk and associated magnetic Ô¨Åelds would lead to a jet emanating from the center of the supernova. Since the jet material will be highly relativistic, it will appear to be further collimated. The jet will plow its way through the overlying material of the infalling stellar envelope producing bursts of gamma-rays. One version of Woosley‚Äôs collapsar model is shown in Fig. 21.

17The highest-energy cosmic-ray particle that had been recorded at the time this text was writtenwas measured by the Fly‚Äôs Eye HiRes experiment in the Utah desert in 1991. The energy ofthe particle was 3√ó1020eV.(a)Convert the energy of the particle to joules.(b)If the particle was a baseball of mass 0.143 kg, calculate the speed of the ball.(c)Convert your answer to miles per hour and compare your answer to the speed of a fast ballof the fastest major league pitchers (approximately 100 mph, or 45 m s‚àí1).18Using Eq. ( 16), show that cosmic-ray particles with energies of greater than 1019eV arenot likely to be bound to the Milky Way Galaxy. (A characteristic size scale for the Galaxy isabout 30 kpc.) What about particles with energies in the range of 1016eV to 1019eV?r=Œ≥ mc2qcB=EqcB.19Nonthermal spectra are often represented by power laws of the formF=CE‚àíŒ±.Figure 22 shows a power-law spectrum for cosmic rays.

The Sun will develop a degenerate helium core while on the red giant branch of the H‚ÄìR diagram, leading eventually to a core helium flash. Later, on the asymptotic giant branch, the progenitor of a carbon‚Äìoxygen white dwarf will form in the core to be revealed when the Sun‚Äôs surface layers are ejected as a planetary nebula.

If it suffers a small perturbation, it will return to its equilibrium structure instead of collapsing. However, in the extreme relativistic limit, the electron speed v = c must be used instead of Eq.

that robs them of energy. As a result, photons are normally more efficient carriers of energy to the stellar surface. In a white dwarf, however, the degenerate electrons can travel long distances before losing energy in a collision with a nucleus, since the vast majority of the lower-energy electron states are already occupied. Thus, in a white dwarf, energy is carried by electron conduction rather than by radiation. This is so efficient that the interior of a white dwarf is nearly isothermal, with the temperature dropping significantly only in the nondegenerate surface layers. Figure 8 shows that a white dwarf consists of a nearly constant-temperature interior surrounded by a thin non-degenerate envelope that transfers heat less efficiently, causing the energy to leak out

combination of two fermions (the neutrons) is a boson and so is not subject to the restrictions of the Pauli exclusion principle. Because degenerate bosons can all crowd into the lowest energy state, the fluid of paired neutrons can lose no energy. It is a superfluid that flows without resistance. Any whirlpools or vortices in the fluid will continue to spin forever without stopping.

stellar structure equations. The first quantitative model of a neutron star was calculated by J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904‚Äì1967) and G. M. Volkoff (1914‚Äì2000) at Berkeley in 1939. Figure 11 shows the result of a recent calculation of a 1.4 M   neutron star model. Although the details are sensitive to the equation of state used, this model displays some typical features.

Pulsating stars. White dwarfs oscillate with periods between 100 and 1000 s. The periods of these nonradial g-modes are much longer than the observed pul-sar periods. Of course, it might be imagined that a radial oscillation is involved with the pulsars. However, the period for the radial fundamental mode is a few seconds, too long to explain the faster pulses.

PROBLEM SET1The most easily observed white dwarf in the sky is in the constellation of Eridanus (the RiverEridanus). Three stars make up the 40 Eridani system: 40 Eri A is a 4th-magnitude star similarto the Sun; 40 Eri B is a 10th-magnitude white dwarf; and 40 Eri C is an 11th-magnitude redM5 star. This problem deals only with the latter two stars, which are separated from 40 Eri Aby 400 AU.(a)The period of the 40 Eri B and C system is 247.9 years. The system‚Äôs measured trigono-metric parallax is 0.201‚Ä≤‚Ä≤and the true angular extent of the semimajor axis of the reducedmass is 6.89‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. The ratio of the distances of 40 Eri B and C from the center of mass isaB/aC=0.37. Find the mass of 40 Eri B and C in terms of the mass of the Sun.(b)The absolute bolometric magnitude of 40 Eri B is 9.6. Determine its luminosity in termsof the luminosity of the Sun.(c)The effective temperature of 40 Eri B is 16,900 K. Calculate its radius, and compare youranswer to the radii of the Sun, Earth, and Sirius B.(d)Calculate the average density of 40 Eri B, and compare your result with the average densityof Sirius B. Which is more dense, and why?(e)Calculate the product of the mass and volume of both 40 Eri B and Sirius B. Is there adeparture from the mass‚Äìvolume relation? What might be the cause?2The helium absorption lines seen in the spectra of DB white dwarfs are formed by excited He Iatoms with one electron in the lowest (n=1) orbital and the other in ann=2 orbital. Whitedwarfs of spectral type DB are not observed with temperatures below about 11,000 K. Usingwhat you know about spectral line formation, give aqualitativeexplanation why the heliumlines would not be seen at lower temperatures. As a DB white dwarf cools below 12,000 K,into what spectral type does it change?3Deduce a rough upper limit forX, the mass fraction of hydrogen, in the interior of a whitedwarf.Hint:Use the mass and average density for Sirius B in the equations for the nuclearenergy generation rate, and takeT=107K for the central temperature.

In other words,for what value ofvdoes the Lorentz factor,Œ≥, become equal to 1.1?(b)Estimate the density of the white dwarf for which the speed of a degenerate electron isequal to the value found in part (a).(c)Use the mass‚Äìvolume relation to Ô¨Ånd the approximate mass of a white dwarf with thisaverage density. This is roughly the mass where white dwarfs depart from the mass‚Äìvolumerelation.8Crystallization will occur in a cooling white dwarf when the electrostatic potential energybetween neighboring nuclei,Z2e2/4œÄœµ0r, dominates the characteristic thermal energykT.The ratio of the two is deÔ¨Åned to beŒ¥Gamma‚Ñì,Œ¥Gamma‚Ñì=Z2e24œÄœµ0rkT.In this expression, the distancerbetween neighboring nuclei is customarily (and somewhatawkwardly) deÔ¨Åned to be the radius of a sphere whose volume is equal to the volume pernucleus.

The results indicate a value of aboutŒ¥Gamma‚Ñì=160 for the onset ofcrystallization. Estimate the interior temperature,Tc, at which this occurs.(c)Estimate the luminosity of a pure carbon white dwarf with this interior temperature.AssumecompositionlikethatofExample5.1offorthenondegenerate envelope.(d)For roughly how many years could the white dwarf sustain the luminosity found in part (c),using just the latent heat ofkTper nucleus released upon crystallization?

What will happen to the iron cube? (Hint:Imagine concentrating half of the cube‚Äôs mass on each of its top and bottom surfaces.)What would happen to an iron meteoroid falling toward the surface of a neutron star?12Estimate the neutron degeneracy pressure at the center of a 1.4 M‚äôneutron star (take thecentral density to be 1.5√ó1018kg m‚àí3), and compare this with the estimated pressure at thecenter of Sirius B.13 (a)Assume that at a density just below neutron drip, all of the neutrons are in heavy neutron-rich nuclei such as11836Kr. Estimate the pressure due to relativistic degenerate electrons.(b)Assume (wrongly!) that at a density just above neutron drip, all of the neutrons are free(and not in nuclei). Estimate the speed of the degenerate neutrons and the pressure theywould produce.14Suppose that the Sun were to collapse down to the size of a neutron star (10-km radius).(a)Assuming that no mass is lost in the collapse, Ô¨Ånd the rotation period of the neutron star.(b)Find the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of the neutron star.Even though our Sun will not end its life as a neutron star, this shows that the conservationof angular momentum and magnetic Ô¨Çux can easily produce pulsar-like rotation speeds andmagnetic Ô¨Åelds.The Degenerate Remnants of Stars: Problem Set

1 THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
Gravity, the weakest of the four forces of nature, plays a fundamental role in sculpting the
universe on the largest scale. Newton‚Äôs law of universal gravitation,
F=GMm
r2, (1)
remained an unquestioned cornerstone of astronomers‚Äô understanding of heavenly motions
until the beginning of the twentieth century. Its application had explained the motions of
the known planets and had accurately predicted the existence and position of the planet
Neptune in 1846. The sole blemish on Newtonian gravitation was the inexplicably large
rate of shift in the orientation of Mercury‚Äôs orbit.
The gravitational inÔ¨Çuences of the other planets cause the major axis of Mercury‚Äôs
elliptical orbit to slowly swing around the Sun in a counterclockwise direction relative to
the Ô¨Åxed stars; see Fig. 1. The angular position at which perihelion occurs shifts at a
rate of 574‚Ä≤‚Ä≤per century.1However, Newton‚Äôs law of gravity was unable to explain 43‚Ä≤‚Ä≤per
century of this shift, an inconsistency that led some mid-nineteenth century physicists to
suggest that Eq. ( 1) should be modiÔ¨Åed from an exact inverse-square law. Others thought
that an unseen planet, nicknamed Vulcan, might occupy an orbit inside Mercury‚Äôs.
The Curvature of Spacetime
Between the years 1907 and 1915, Albert Einstein developed a new theory of gravity,
hisgeneral theory of relativity . In addition to resolving the mystery of Mercury‚Äôs orbit,
it predicted many new phenomena that were later conÔ¨Årmed by experiment. In this and
the next section we will describe just enough of the physical content of general relativity
to provide the background needed for future discussions of black holes and cosmology.
1The value of 1 .5‚ó¶per century encountered in some texts includes the very large effect of the precession of Earth‚Äôs
rotation axis on the celestial coordinate system.

FIGURE 1The perihelion shift of Mercury‚Äôs orbit. Both the eccentricity of the orbit and theamount of shift in the location of perihelion in successive orbits have been exaggerated to better showthe effect.Einstein‚Äôs view of the universe provides an exhilarating challenge to the imaginations ofall students of astrophysics. But, before embarking on our study of general relativity, it willbe helpful to take an advanced look at this new gravitational landscape.The general theory of relativity is fundamentally a geometric description of how distances(intervals) in spacetime are measured in the presence of mass. For the moment, the effectson space and time will be considered separately, although you should always keep in mindthat relativity deals with a uniÔ¨Åed spacetime. Near an object, both space and time must bedescribed in a new way.Distances between points in the space surrounding a massive object are altered in away that can be interpreted as space becomingcurvedthrough a fourth spatial dimensionperpendicular toallof the usual three spatial directions. The human mind balks at picturingthis situation, but an analogy is easily found. Imagine four people holding the corners ofa rubber sheet, stretching it tight and Ô¨Çat. This represents the Ô¨Çatness of empty space thatexists in the absence of mass. Also imagine that a polar coordinate system has been paintedon the sheet, with evenly spaced concentric circles spreading out from its center. Nowlay a heavy bowling ball (representing the Sun) at the center of the sheet, and watch theindentation of the sheet as it curves down and stretches in response to the ball‚Äôs weight,as pictured in Fig. 2. Closer to the ball, the sheet‚Äôs curvature increases and the distancebetween points on the circles is stretched more. Just as the sheet curves in a third directionperpendicular to its original Ô¨Çat two-dimensional plane, the space surrounding a massiveobject may be thought of as curving in a fourth spatial dimension perpendicular to the usualthree of ‚ÄúÔ¨Çat space.‚Äù2The fact that mass has an effect on the surrounding space is the Ô¨Årstessential element of general relativity. The curvature of space is just one aspect of the effect2It is important to note that this fourth spatial dimension has nothing at all to do with the role played by time as afourth nonspatialcoordinatein the theory of relativity.General Relativity and Black Holes

In the language of uniÔ¨Åed spacetime,mass acts on spacetime, tellingit how to curve.Now imagine rolling a tennis ball, representing a planet, across the sheet. As it passesnear the bowling ball, the tennis ball‚Äôs path is curved. If the ball were rolled in just theright way under ideal conditions, it could even ‚Äúorbit‚Äù the more massive bowling ball. Ina similar manner, a planet orbits the Sun as it responds to the curved spacetime around it.Thuscurved spacetime acts on mass, telling it how to move.The passage of a ray of light near the Sun can be represented by rolling a ping-pong ballvery rapidly past the bowling ball. Although the analogy with a massless photon is strained,it is reasonable to expect that as the photon moves through the curved space surroundingthe Sun, its path will be deÔ¨Çected from a straight line. The bend of the photon‚Äôs trajectory issmall because the photon‚Äôs speed carries it quickly through the curved space; see Fig. 3.In general relativity, gravity is the result of objects moving through curved spacetime, andeverything that passes through, even massless particles such as photons, is affected.General Relativity and Black Holes

SunActual pathABCFIGURE 4Comparison of two photon paths through curved space between pointsAandB.The projection of the pathACBonto the plane is the straight line depicted in Fig. 3.Figure 3 hints at another aspect of general relativity. Since nothing can move betweentwo points in space faster than light, light must always follow the quickest route betweenany two points.3In Ô¨Çat, empty space, this path is a straight line, but what is the quickestroute through curved space? Suppose we use a series of mirrors to force the light beam totravel between pointsAandBby the apparent ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù indicated by the dashed lines inFigs. 3 and 4. Would the light taking the dashed path outrace the beam free to followits natural route through curved space? The answer is no‚Äîthe curved beam would win therace. This result seems to imply that the beam following the dashed line would slow downalong the way. However, this inference can‚Äôt be correct because, according to the postulatesgeneral relativity, these effects contribute equally to delaying the light beam‚Äôs trip fromAtoBalong the dashed line. The curving light beam actually does travel theshorterpath. Iftwo space travelers were to lay meter sticks end-to-end along the two paths, the dashed pathwould require a greater number of meter sticks because it penetrates farther into curvedspace, as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the curvature of space involves a concomitantslowing down of time, so clocks placed along the dashed path would actuallyrun moreslowly. This is the Ô¨Ånal essential feature of general relativity:Time runs more slowly incurved spacetime.It is important to note that all of the foregoing ideas have been tested experimentallymany times, and in every case the results agree with general relativity. As soon as Einsteincompleted his theory, he applied it to the problem of Mercury‚Äôs unexplained residual per-ihelion shift of 43‚Ä≤‚Ä≤per century. Einstein wrote that his heart raced when his calculationsexactly explained the discrepancy in terms of the planet‚Äôs passage through the curved spacenear the Sun, saying that, ‚ÄúFor a few days, I was beside myself with joyous excitement.‚ÄùAnother triumph came in 1919 when the curving path of starlight passing near the Sunwas Ô¨Årst measured, by Arthur Stanley Eddington, during a total solar eclipse. As shown3Throughout this chapter, light is assumed to be traveling in a vacuum.General Relativity and Black Holes
of relativity, every observer, including one at point C, measures the same value for the speed of light. There are just two possible answers. The distance along the dashed line might actually be longer than the light beam‚Äôs natural path, and/or time might run more slowly along the dashed path; either would retard the beam‚Äôs passage. In fact, according to

Einstein‚Äôs theory predicted that this angulardeÔ¨Çection would be 1.75‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, in good agreement with Eddington‚Äôs observations. General rel-ativity has been tested continuously ever since. For instance, the superior conjunction ofMars that occurred in 1976 led to a spectacular conÔ¨Årmation of Einstein‚Äôs theory. Radiosignals beamed to Earth from the Viking spacecraft on Mars‚Äôs surface were delayed as theytraveled deep into the curved space surrounding the Sun. The time delay agreed with thepredictions of general relativity to within 0.1%.The Principle of EquivalenceIt is now time to retrace our steps and discover how Einstein came to his revolutionaryunderstanding of gravity as geometry. One of the postulates of special relativity states thatthe laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. Accelerating frames ofreference are not inertial frames, because they introduce Ô¨Åctitious forces that depend on theacceleration. For example, an apple at rest on the seat of a car will not remain at rest if thecar suddenly brakes to a halt. However, the acceleration produced by the force of gravityhas a unique aspect. This may be clearly seen by noting a fundamental difference betweenNewton‚Äôs law of gravity and Coulomb‚Äôs law for the electrical force.Consider two objects separated by a distancer, one of massmand chargeq, and theother of massMand chargeQ. The magnitude of the acceleration (ag) of massmdue tothe gravitational forceis found frommag=GmMr2,(2)General Relativity and Black Holes

while the magnitude of the acceleration (ae)due to the electrical forceis found frommae=qQ4œÄœµ0r2.(3)The massmon the left-hand sides is aninertial massand measures the object‚Äôs resistanceto being accelerated (its inertia). On the right-hand sides, the massesmandMand chargesqandQare numbers that couple the masses or charges to their respective forces anddetermine the strength of these forces. The mystery is the appearance ofmon both sides ofthe gravitational formula.Why should a quantity that measures an object‚Äôs inertia (which exists even in the completeabsence of gravity) be the same as the ‚Äúgravitational charge‚Äù that determines the force ofgravity? The answer is that the notation in Eq. ( 2) is Ô¨Çawed, and the expression shouldproperly be written asmiag=GmgMgr2orag=GMgr2mgmi(4)to clearly distinguish between the inertial and gravitational mass of each object. Similarly,for Eq. (3),ae=14œÄœµ0qQr21mi.In this case the only mass that enters the expression is the inertial mass.It is an experimental fact, tested to a precision of 1 part in 1012, thatmg/miin Eq. ( 4)is a constant. For convenience, this constant is chosen to be unity so the two types of masswill be numerically equal; if the gravitational mass were chosen to betwicethe inertial mass,for example, the laws of physics would be unchanged except the gravitational constantGwould be assigned a new value only one-fourth as large. The proportionality of the inertialand gravitational masses means that at a given location, all objects experience thesamegravitational acceleration. The constancy ofmg/miis sometimes referred to as theweakequivalence principle.This distinctive aspect of gravity, that every object falls with the same acceleration, hasbeen known since the time of Galileo. It presented Einstein with both a problem and anopportunity to extend his theory of special relativity. He realized that if an entire laboratorywere in free-fall, with all of its contents falling together, there would then be no way to detectits acceleration. In such a freely falling laboratory, it would be impossible to experimentallydetermine whether the laboratory was Ô¨Çoating in space, far from any massive object, orfalling freely in a gravitational Ô¨Åeld. Similarly, an observer watching an apple falling withan accelerationgtoward the Ô¨Çoor of a laboratory would be unable to tell whether thelaboratory was on Earth or far out in space, accelerating at a rategin the direction of theceiling, as illustrated in Fig. 6. This posed a serious problem for the theory of specialGeneral Relativity and Black Holes

Becausegravity is equivalent to an accelerating laboratory, an inertial reference frame cannot evenbe deÔ¨Åned in the presence of gravity. Einstein had to Ô¨Ånd a way to remove gravity from thelaboratory.In 1907, Einstein had ‚Äúthe happiest thought of my life.‚ÄùI was sitting in a chair in the patent ofÔ¨Åce at Bern when all of a sudden a thoughtoccurred to me: ‚ÄúIf a person falls freely he will not feel his own weight.‚Äù I wasstartled. This simple thought made a deep impression on me. It impelled metoward a theory of gravitation.The way to eliminate gravity in a laboratory is to surrender to it by entering into a state offree-fall; see Fig. 7.4However, there was an obstacle to applying this to special relativitybecause its inertial reference frames areinÔ¨Ånitecollections of meter sticks and synchronizedrealized that he would have to uselocalreference frames, just small enough that the ac-celeration due to gravity would be essentially constant in both magnitude and directioneverywhere inside the reference frame (see Fig. 8). Gravity would then be abolishedinside a local, freely falling reference frame.4Free-fallmeans that there are no nongravitational forces accelerating the laboratory. In his meditation on generalrelativity,A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime(see Suggested Readings), John A. Wheeler prefers the termfree-Ô¨Çoat. Since gravity has been abolished, why should falling even be mentioned?

The Bending of LightWe now move on to two simple thought experiments involving the equivalence principlethat demonstrate the curvature of spacetime. For the Ô¨Årst experiment, imagine a laboratorysuspended above the ground by a cable [see Fig. 9(a)]. Let a photon of light leave ahorizontal Ô¨Çashlight at the same instant the cable holding the lab is severed [Fig. 9(b)].Gravity has been abolished from this freely falling lab, so it is now a local inertial referenceframe. According to the equivalence principle, an observer falling with the lab will measurethe light‚Äôs path across the room as a straight horizontal line, in agreement with all of thelaws of physics. But another observer on the ground sees a lab that is falling under theinÔ¨Çuence of gravity. Because the photon maintains a constant height above the lab‚Äôs Ô¨Çoor,the ground observer must measure a photon that falls with the lab, following a curvedpath. This displays the spacetime curvature represented by the rubber sheet analogy. Thecurved path taken by the photon is the quickest route possible through the curved spacetimesurrounding Earth.The angle of deÔ¨Çection,œÜ, of the photon is very slight, as the following bit of geometryshows.Although the photon does not follow a circular path, we will use thebest-Ô¨Åtting circleof radiusrcto the actual path measured by the ground observer. Referring to Fig. 10,the center of the best-Ô¨Åtting circle is at pointO, and the arc of the circle subtends an angleœÜ(exaggerated in the Ô¨Ågure) between the radiiOAandOB. If the width of the lab is‚Ñì,then the photon crosses the lab in timet=‚Ñì/c. (The difference between the length of thearc and the width of the lab is negligible.) In this amount of time, the lab falls a distance

Nonetheless, the curvature is great enough to producethe circular orbits of satellites, which move slowly through the curved spacetime (slowly,that is, compared to the speed of light).General Relativity and Black Holes

Gravitational Redshift and Time DilationOur second thought experiment also begins with the laboratory suspended above the groundby a cable. This time, monochromatic light of frequencyŒΩ0leaves a vertical Ô¨Çashlight onthe Ô¨Çoor at the same instant the cable holding the lab is severed. The freely falling labis again a local inertial frame where gravity has been abolished, and so the equivalenceprinciple requires that a frequency meter in the lab‚Äôs ceiling record thesamefrequency,ŒΩ0,for the light that it receives. But an observer on the ground sees a lab that is falling underthe inÔ¨Çuence of gravity. As shown in Fig. 11, if the light has traveled upward a heighthtoward the meter in timet=h/c, then the meter has gained a downward speed toward thelight ofv=gt=gh/csince the cable was released. Accordingly, we would expect thatfrom the point of view of the ground observer, the meter should have measured a blueshiftedfrequency greater thanŒΩ0.For the slow free-fall speedsinvolved here, this expectedincreasein frequency is/Delta1ŒΩŒΩ0=vc=ghc2.But in fact, the meter recordedno changein frequency. Therefore there must be anothereffect of the light‚Äôs upward journey through the curved spacetime around Earth that exactlycompensates for this blueshift. This is agravitational redshiftthat tends todecreasethefrequency of the light as it travels upward a distanceh, given by/Delta1ŒΩŒΩ0=‚àívc=‚àíghc2.(6)An outside observer, not in free-fall inside the lab, would measure only this gravitational

redshift. If the light were traveling downward, a corresponding blueshift would be measured.It is left as an exercise to show that this formula remains valid even if the light is travelingat an angle to the vertical, as long ashis taken to be theverticaldistance covered by thelight.Example 1.1.In 1960, a test of the gravitational redshift formula was carried out atHarvard University. A gamma ray was emitted by an unstable isotope of iron,5726Fe, at thebottom of a tower 22.6 m tall, and received at the top of the tower. Using this value forh,the expected decrease in frequency of the gamma ray due to the gravitational redshift is/Delta1ŒΩŒΩ0=‚àíghc2=‚àí2.46√ó10‚àí15,(7)in excellent agreement with the experimental result of/Delta1ŒΩ/ŒΩ0=‚àí(2.57¬±0.26)√ó10‚àí15.More precise experiments carried out since that time have obtained agreement to within0.007%.In actuality, the experiment was performed with both upward- and downward-travelinggamma rays, providing tests of both the gravitational redshift and blueshift.An approximate expression for the total gravitational redshift for a beam of light thatescapes out to inÔ¨Ånity can be calculated by integrating Eq. ( 6) from an initial positionr0to inÔ¨Ånity, usingg=GM/r2(Newtonian gravity) and settinghequal to the differentialradial element,drfor a spherical mass,M, located at the origin. Some care must be takenwhen carrying out the integration, because Eq. ( 7) was derived using alocalinertialreference frame. By integrating, we are really adding up the redshifts obtained for a chainofdifferentframes. The radial coordinatercan be used to measure distances for theseframes only if spacetime is nearly Ô¨Çat [that is, if the radius of curvature given by Eq. ( 5)is very large compared withr0]. In this case, the ‚Äústretching‚Äù of distances seen previouslyin the rubber sheet analogy is not too severe, and we can integrate/integraldisplayŒΩ‚àûŒΩ0dŒΩŒΩ‚âÉ‚àí/integraldisplay‚àûr0GMr2c2dr,whereŒΩ0andŒΩ‚àûare the frequencies atr0and inÔ¨Ånity, respectively.

The time between ticksis then equal to the period of the oscillation of the wave,/Delta1t=1/ŒΩ. Then according toEq.

The gravitational redshift is thereforea consequence of time running at a slower rate near a massive object.In other words, suppose two perfect, identical clocks are initially standing side by side,equally distant from a spherical mass. They are synchronized, and then one is slowly loweredbelow the other and then raised back to its original level. All observers will agree that whenthe clocks are again side by side, the clock that was lowered will be running behind theother because time in its vicinity passed more slowly while it was deeper in the mass‚Äôsgravitational Ô¨Åeld.,General Relativity and Black Holes

On the right is thestress‚Äìenergy tensor,T, which evaluates the effect of a given distributionof mass and energy on the curvature of spacetime, as described mathematically by theEinstein tensor,G(forGravity), on the left.6The appearance of Newton‚Äôs gravitationalconstant,G, and the speed of light symbolizes the extension of relativity theory to includegravity. It is far beyond the scope of this book to delve further into this fascinating equation.We will be content merely to describe the curvature of spacetime around a spherical object ofmassMand radiusR, then demonstrate how an object moves through the curved spacetimeit encounters.Worldlines and Light ConesFigure 12 shows three examples of some paths traced out in spacetime. In thesespacetimediagrams, time is represented on the vertical axis, while space is depicted by the horizontalx‚Äìyplane. The third spatial dimension,z, cannot be shown, so this Ô¨Ågure deals only withmotion that occurs in a plane. The path followed by an object as it moves through spacetimeis called itsworldline. Our task will be to calculate the worldline of a freely falling objectin response to the local curvature of spacetime. The spatial components of such a worldlinedescribe the trajectory of a baseball arcing toward an outÔ¨Åelder, a planet orbiting the Sun,or a photon attempting to escape from a black hole.The worldlines of photons in Ô¨Çat spacetime point the way to an understanding of thegeometry of spacetime.

Therefore the region inside the lightcone represents the possiblefutureof eventA. It consists of all of the events that can possiblybe reached by a traveler initially at eventA‚Äîand therefore all of the events that the travelercould ever inÔ¨Çuence in a causal way.Extending the diverging photon worldlines back through the origin generates a lowerlight cone. Within this lower light cone is the possiblepastof eventA, the collection of allevents from which a traveler could have arrived just as the bulb Ô¨Çashed. In other words, thepossible past consists of the locations in space and time of every event that could possiblyhave caused the Ô¨Çashbulb to go off.Outside the future and past light cones is an unknowableelsewhere, that part of spacetimeof which a traveler at eventAcan have no knowledge and over which he or she can haveno inÔ¨Çuence. It may come as a surprise to realize that vast regions of spacetime are hiddenfrom us. You just can‚Äôt get there from here.In principle, every event in spacetime has a pair of light cones extending from it. Thelight cone divides spacetime into that event‚Äôs future, past, and elsewhere. For any event inthe past to have possibly inÔ¨Çuenced you, that event must lie within your past light cone,just as any event that you can ever possibly affect must lie within your future light cone.Your entire future worldline, yourdestiny, must therefore lie within your future lightcone at every instant. Light cones act as spacetime horizons, separating the knowable fromthe unknowable.Spacetime Intervals, Proper Time, and Proper DistanceMeasuring the progress of an object as it moves along its worldline involves deÔ¨Åning a‚Äúdistance‚Äù for spacetime.

Even the ‚Äústraightest possible worldline‚Äù will be curved. These straightest possibleworldlines are calledgeodesics. In Ô¨Çat spacetime a geodesic is a straight worldline.In curved spacetime, a timelike geodesic between two events has either amaximumor aminimuminterval.

worldlines between the same two events.9In the situations we will encounter in this chapter,the intervals of timelike geodesics will be maxima. A massless particle such as a photonfollows anull geodesic, with/integraltext/radicalbig(ds)2=0.10Einstein‚Äôs key realization was thatthe pathsfollowed by freely falling objects through spacetime are geodesics.We are now prepared to deal with the effect of mass on the geometry of spacetime, basedon the three fundamental features of general relativity:‚Ä¢ Mass acts on spacetime, telling it how to curve.‚Ä¢ Spacetime in turn acts on mass, telling it how to move.‚Ä¢ Any freely falling particle (including a photon) follows the straightest possible world-line, a geodesic, through spacetime. For a massive particle, the geodesic has amaxi-mumor aminimuminterval, while for light, the geodesic has anullinterval.These components of the theory will allow us to describe the curvature of spacetimearound a massive spherical object and to determine how another object will move in re-sponse, whether it is a satellite orbiting Earth or a photon orbiting a black hole. For situationswith spherical symmetry, it will be more convenient to use the familiar spherical coordi-nates(r, Œ∏, œÜ)instead of Cartesian coordinates. The metric between two nearby points inÔ¨Çat space is then(d‚Ñì)2=(dr)2+(r dŒ∏)2+(rsinŒ∏d œÜ )2,(20)and the corresponding expression for the Ô¨Çat spacetime metric is(ds)2=(c dt)2‚àí(dr)2‚àí(r dŒ∏)2‚àí(rsinŒ∏d œÜ )2.(21)Of course, spacetime will not be Ô¨Çat in the vicinity of a massive object. The speciÔ¨Åcsituation to be investigated here is the motion of a particle through the curved spacetimeproduced by a massive sphere. It could be a planet, a star, or a black hole. The Ô¨Årst task is tocalculate how this massive object acts on spacetime, telling it how to curve. This requiresa description of the metric for this curved spacetime that will replace Eq. ( 21) for a Ô¨Çatspacetime.Before presenting this metric, we must emphasize that the variablesr,Œ∏,œÜ, andtthatappear in the expression for the metric are thecoordinatesused by an observer at rest agreat (‚âÉinÔ¨Ånite) distance from the origin. In the absence of a central mass at the origin,rwould be the distance from the origin, and differences inrwould measure the distancebetween points on a radial line. The timetmeasured by clocks scattered throughout thecoordinate system would remain synchronized, advancing everywhere at the same rate.9In fact, a calculation of the intervals of nearby worldlines would show that the interval of a timelike geodesiccorresponds to a maximum, a minimum, or an inÔ¨Çection point. You are referred to Section 13.4 of Misner, Thorne,and Wheeler (1973) for an interesting discussion of geodesics as worldlines of extremal proper time.10The extremal principle for intervals cannot be directly applied to Ô¨Ånd the straightest possible worldline for aphoton, since its interval is always null. However, the straightest possible worldline for a massless particle is thesame as that for a massive particle in the limit of a vanishingly small mass as its velocityv‚Üíc.General Relativity and Black Holes

Now we place a sphere of massMand radiusR(which will be called a ‚Äúplanet‚Äù) at theorigin of our coordinate system. Some care must be taken in laying out the radial coordinate.The origin (which is inside the sphere) should not be used as a point of reference, and so wewill avoid deÔ¨Åningras ‚Äúthe distance from the origin.‚Äù Instead, imagine a series of nestedconcentric spheres centered at the origin. The surface area of a sphere can be measuredwithout approaching the origin, so the coordinaterwill be deÔ¨Åned by the surface of thatsphere having an area 4œÄr2. With this careful approach, we will Ô¨Ånd that these coordinatescan be used with the metric for curved spacetime to measure distances in space and thepassage of time near this massive sphere.As an object moves through this curved spacetime,itscoordinate speedis just the rate at which its spatial coordinates change.At a large distance (r‚âÉ‚àû) from the planet, spacetime is essentially Ô¨Çat, and the gravita-tional time dilation of a photon received from the planet is given by Eq. ( 13). From this,it might be expected that/radicalbig1‚àí2GM/rc2would play a role in the metric for the spacetimesurrounding the planet. Furthermore, recall from Section 1 that the stretching of spaceand the slowing down of time contribute equally to delaying a light beam‚Äôs passage throughcurved spacetime. This provides a hint that the same factor will be involved in the metric‚Äôsradial term. The angular terms are the same as those in Eq. ( 21) for Ô¨Çat spacetime.These effects are indeed present in the metric that describes the curved spacetime sur-rounding a spherical mass,M. In 1916, just two months after Einstein published his generaltheory of relativity, the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild (1873‚Äì1916) solved Ein-stein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations to obtain what is now called theSchwarzschild metric:(ds)2=/parenleftBigcdt/radicalbig1‚àí2GM/rc2/parenrightBig2‚àí/parenleftBiggdr/radicalbig1‚àí2GM/rc2/parenrightBigg2‚àí(r dŒ∏)2‚àí(rsinŒ∏d œÜ )2.(22)There is no other, easier way to obtain the Schwarzschild metric, so we must be contentwith the foregoing heuristic description of its terms.It is important to realize that the Schwarzschild metric is the spherically symmetricvacuum solutionof Einstein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations. That is, it is valid only in the empty spaceoutsidethe object. The mathematical form of the metric is different in the object‚Äôs interior,which is occupied by matter.The Schwarzschild metric contains all of the effects considered in the last section. The‚Äúcurvature of space‚Äù resides in the radial term. The radial distance measured simultaneously(dt=0) between two nearby points on the same radial line (dŒ∏=dœÜ=0) is just the properdistance, Eq. (18),dL=/radicalbig‚àí(ds)2=dr/radicalbig1‚àí2GM/rc2.(23)Thus the spatial distancedLbetween two points on the same radial line isgreaterthan thecoordinate differencedr. This is precisely what is represented by the stretched grid linesin the rubber sheet analogy of the previous section. The factor of 1/slashbig/radicalbig1‚àí2GM/rc2mustbe included in any calculation of spatial distances. This is analogous to using a topographicGeneral Relativity and Black Holes

The rest of this section will be devoted to using general relativity to Ô¨Ånd themotion of a satellite about the planet. All we need is the rule that it will follow the straightestpossible worldline, the worldline with anextremalinterval.11At this point, you may be fondly recalling the simplicity of Newtonian gravity.Accordingto Newton, the motion of a satellite in a circular orbit around Earth is found by simplyequating the centripetal and gravitational accelerations.

This immediately results inv=/radicalbiggGMr.Einstein and Newton must agree in the limiting case of weak gravity, so this result mustbe concealed within the Schwarzschild metric for curved spacetime.12It can be found byusing the Schwarzschild metric to Ô¨Ånd the straightest possible worldline for the satellite‚Äôscircular orbit.Powerful tools are available for calculating the worldline with the maximum intervalbetween two Ô¨Åxed events. If we employed such an approach, the orbit of the satellitewould emerge along with the laws of the conservation of energy, momentum, and angularmomentum because they are built into Einstein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations. However, we will usea simpler strategy and assume from the beginning that the satellite travels above Earth‚Äôsequator (Œ∏=90‚ó¶) in a circular orbit with a speciÔ¨Åed angular speedœâ=v/r. Inserting thesechoices, along withdr=0,dŒ∏=0, anddœÜ=œâdt, into the Schwarzschild metric gives(ds)2=/bracketleftbigg/parenleftBigc/radicalbig1‚àí2GM/rc2/parenrightBig2‚àír2œâ2/bracketrightbiggdt2=/parenleftbiggc2‚àí2GMr‚àír2œâ2/parenrightbiggdt2.Integrating, the spacetime interval for one orbit is just/Delta1s=/integraldisplay2œÄ/œâ0/radicalbiggc2‚àí2GMr‚àír2œâ2dt.(25)When Ô¨Ånding the value ofrfor which the interval is an extremum, we must be certainthat the endpoints of the satellite‚Äôs worldline remain Ô¨Åxed. That is, the satellite‚Äôs orbit mustalways begin and end at the same position,r0, for all of the worldlines. To accommodateorbits of different radii, consider the ‚Äúorbit‚Äù shown in Fig. 17. We start the satellite atr0and then move it (at nearly the speed of light) radially outward to the radiusrof its actualorbit. At the end of the orbit, the satellite returns just as rapidly to its starting point atr0.Fortunately, the quick radial excursions at the beginning and the end of the orbit can bemade with negligible contribution to the integral for the spacetime interval. (At almost thespeed of light, the contribution is nearly null.) The net effect is a purely circular motion, soEq. ( 25) can be used to evaluate the interval.In Eq. ( 25), the limits of integration are constant and the only variable isr. The valueof the radial coordinaterfor the orbit actually followed by the satellite must be the one forwhich/Delta1sis an extremum.

When the radial coordinate of the star‚Äôs surface has collapsed toRS=2GM/c2,(27)called theSchwarzschild radius, the square roots in the metric go to zero. The resultingbehavior of space and time atr=RSis remarkable. For example, according to Eq. ( 17),the proper time measured by a clock at the Schwarzschild radius isdœÑ=0. Time has slowedto a complete stop, as measured from a vantage point that is at rest a great distance away.14From this viewpoint,nothing ever happens at the Schwarzschild radius!This behavior is quite curious; does it imply that even light is frozen in time? The speedof light measured by an observer suspended above the collapsed star must always bec.But from far away, we can determine that light is delayed as it moves through curvedspacetime. (Recall the time delay of radio signals from the Viking lander on Mars describedin Section 1.)

The sphericalsurface atr=RSacts as a barrier and prevents our receiving any information from within.For this reason, a star that has collapsed down within the Schwarzschild radius is called ablack hole.15It is enclosed by theevent horizon, the spherical surface atr=RS. Notethat the event horizon is a mathematical surface and need not coincide with any physicalsurface.Although the interior of a black hole, inside the event horizon, is a region that is foreverhidden from us on the outside, its properties may still be calculated. A nonrotating blackhole has a particularly simple structure. At the center is thesingularity, a point of zerovolume and inÔ¨Ånite density where all of the black hole‚Äôs mass is located.

In fact, there is a hypothesis dubbed the ‚ÄúLaw ofCosmic Censorship‚Äù that forbids anaked singularityfrom appearing unclothed (without anassociated event horizon).A Trip into a Black HoleAn object as bizarre as a black hole deserves closer scrutiny. Imagine an attempt to investi-gate the black hole by starting at a safe distance and reÔ¨Çecting a radio wave from an objectat the event horizon. How much time will it take for a radio photon (or any photon) to reachthe event horizon from a radial coordinater‚â´RSand then return? Since the round trip issymmetric, it is necessary only to Ô¨Ånd the time for either the journey in or out and then dou-ble the answer. It is easiest to integrate the coordinate speed of light in the radial direction,Eq. (28), between two arbitrary values ofr1andr2to obtain the general answer,/Delta1t=/integraldisplayr2r1drdr/dt=/integraldisplayr2r1drc(1‚àíRS/r)=r2‚àír1c+RScln/parenleftbiggr2‚àíRSr1‚àíRS/parenrightbigg,assuming thatr1<r2. Insertingr1=RSfor the photon‚Äôs original position, we Ô¨Ånd that/Delta1t=‚àû. Now, since the trip is symmetric, the same result applies if the photon started atRS. According to the distant observer, the radio photon willneverreach the event horizon.Instead, according to gravitational time dilation, the photon‚Äôs coordinate velocity will slowdown until it Ô¨Ånally stops at the event horizon in the inÔ¨Ånite future. In fact, any object fallingtoward the event horizon will suffer the same fate. Seen from the outside, even the surfaceof the star that collapsed to form the event horizon would be frozen, and so a black hole isin this sense afrozen star.Abrave (andindestructible) astronomer decides to test this remarkable conclusion.

She gradually accelerates as she monitorsher watch and shines a monochromatic Ô¨Çashlight back in our direction once every second.As her fall progresses, the light signals arrive farther and farther apart for several reasons:Subsequent signals must travel a longer distance as she accelerates, and her proper timeœÑis running more slowly than our coordinate timetdue to her location (gravitational timedilation) and her motion (special relativity time dilation). Furthermore, the coordinate speedof light becomes slower as she approaches the black hole, so the signals travel back to usmore slowly. The frequency of the light waves we receive is also increasingly redshifted.This is caused by both her acceleration away from us and the gravitational redshift. Thelight becomes dimmer as well, as the rate at which her Ô¨Çashlight emits photons decreases(seen from our vantage point) and the energy per photon (hc/Œª) also declines. Then whenshe is about 2RSfrom the event horizon, the time between her signals begins to increasewithout limit as the strength of the signals decreases. The light is redshifted and dimmedinto invisibility as time dilation brings her coordinate speed to zero (see Figs. 19 and20).Sheisfrozenintime,heldforeternitylikeaÔ¨Çycaughtinamber.Oursuccessorscould watch for millennia while stars were born, evolved, and died without receiving asingle photon from her.How does all of this appear to the brave astronomer, freely falling toward the blackhole? Because gravity has been abolished in her local inertial frame, initially she does notnotice her approach to the black hole. She monitors her watch (which displays her propertime,œÑ), and she turns on her Ô¨Çashlight once per second. However, as she draws closer,she begins to feel as though she is being stretched in the radial direction and compressedin the perpendicular directions; see Fig. 21. The gravitational pull on her feet (nearerthe black hole) is stronger than on her head, and the variation in the direction of gravity

In other words, the size of her local inertial frame(where gravity has been abolished) becomes increasing smaller as the spatial variation in thegravitational acceleration vector,g, increases. Were she not indestructible, our astronomerwould be torn apart by the tidal force while still several hundred kilometers from the blackhole.In just two milliseconds (proper time), she falls the Ô¨Ånal few hundred kilometers to theevent horizon and crosses it. Her proper time continues normally, and she encounters nofrozen stellar surface since it has fallen through long ago.1However, once inside the eventhorizon, her fate is sealed. It is impossible for any particle to be at rest whenr<RS,a scan be seen from the Schwarzschild metric (Eq. 22).

Thereforeit is impossible to remain at rest wherer<RS. Within the event horizon of a nonrotatingblack hole, all worldlines converge at the singularity. Even photons are pulled in toward thecenter. This means that the astronomer never has an opportunity to glimpse the singularitybecause no photons can reach her from there. She can, however, see the light that falls inbehind her from events in the outside universe, but she does not see the entire history of1The presence or absence of a frozen stellar surface at the event horizon makes no real difference; the Schwarz-schild metric speciÔ¨Åes the same spacetime curvature outside.7

the universe as it unfolds. Although the elapsed coordinate time in the outside world doesbecome inÔ¨Ånite, the light from all of these events does not have time to reach the astronomer.Instead, these events occur in her ‚Äúelsewhere.‚Äù Just 6.6√ó10‚àí5s of proper time after passingthe event horizon, she is inexorably drawn to the singularity.1Mass Ranges of Black HolesBlack holes appear to exist with a range of masses.Stellar-mass black holes, with masses inthe range of 3 to 15 M‚äôor so, may form directly or indirectly as a consequence of the core-the degeneracy pressure to support it, again resulting in a black hole.Intermediate-mass black holes(IMBHs) may exist that range in mass from roughly100 M‚äôto in excess of 1000 M‚äô(or perhaps even greater than 104M‚äô). Evidence forthem exists in the detection of sources known asultraluminous X-ray sources(ULXs)that have been discovered by satellites such as Chandra and XMM-Newton. It is not entirelyclear how these objects might form, although the correlation of IMBHs with the cores ofglobular clusters and low-mass galaxies suggests that they may develop in these densestellar environments either by the mergers of stars to form a supermassive star that thencore-collapses, or by the merger of stellar-mass black holes.Supermassive black holes(SMBH) are known to exist at the centers of many (andprobably most) galaxies. These enormous black holes range in mass from 105M‚äôto 109M‚äô(our own Milky Way Galaxy has a central black hole of massM=3.7¬±0.2√ó106M‚äô).How these behemoths formed remains an open question. One popular suggestion is thatthey formed from collisions between galaxies; another is that they formed as an extensionof the formation process of IMBHs. Whatever the process, SMBHs appear to be closelylinked with some bulk properties of galaxies, implying an important connection betweengalaxy formation and the formation of SMBHs.Black holes may have also been manufactured in the earliest instants of the universe.Presumably, theseprimordial black holeswould have been formed with a wide range ofmasses, from 10‚àí8kg to 105M‚äô. The only criterion for a black hole is that its entire massmust lie within the Schwarzschild radius, so the Schwarzschild metric is valid at the eventhorizon.Example 3.1.If Earth could somehow (miraculously) be compressed sufÔ¨Åciently tobecome a black hole, its radius would only beRS=2GM‚äï/c2=0.009 m. Although aprimordial black hole could be this size, it is almost impossible to imagine packing Earth‚Äôsentire mass into so small a ball.18A thorough description of the Ô¨Ånal view of the falling astronomer may be found in Rothman et al. (1985).You are reminded that the Schwarzschild metric is valid only outside matter. It does not describe the spacetimeinside Earth.8

collapse of a sufÔ¨Åciently massive supergiant star. The direct collapse of the core to a black hole may be responsible for the production of collapsar, whereas a delayed collapse of a rapidly rotating neutron star may result in a supranova. It is also pos-sible that a neutron star in a close binary system may gravitationally strip enough mass from its companion that the neutron star‚Äôs self-gravity exceeds the ability of

Black Holes Have No Hair!Whatever the formation processes of black holes, they are certain to be very complicated. Forexample, the core-collapse of a star is almost certainly not symmetrical. Detailed calcula-tions have demonstrated, however, that any irregularities are radiated away by gravitationalAnother complication is the fact that all stars rotate, and therefore so will the resultingblack hole. Remarkably, however, any black hole can be completely described by just threenumbers: its mass, angular momentum, and electric charge.2Black holes have no otherattributes or adornments, a condition commonly expressed by saying that ‚Äúa black hole hasno hair.‚Äù2There is a Ô¨Årm upper limit for a rotating black hole‚Äôs angular momentum given byLmax=GM2c.(29)If the angular momentum of a rotating black hole were to exceed this limit, there would beno event horizon and a naked singularity would appear, in violation of the Law of CosmicCensorship.Example 3.2.The maximum angular momentum for a solar-mass black hole isLmax=GM2‚äôc=8.81√ó1041kg m2s‚àí1.By comparison, the angular momentum of the Sun (assuming uniform rotation) is 1.63√ó1041kg m2s‚àí1, about 18% ofLmax. We should expect that many stars will have angularmomenta that are comparable toLmax, and so vigorous (if not maximal) rotation ought tobe common for stellar-mass black holes.Spacetime Frame DraggingThe structure of a maximally rotating black hole is shown in Fig. 22.2The rotationhas distorted the central singularity from a point into a Ô¨Çat ring, and the event horizon hasassumed the shape of an ellipsoid. The Ô¨Ågure also shows additional features caused by therotation. As a massive object spins, it induces a rotation in the surrounding spacetime, aphenomenon known asframe dragging. To gain some insight into this effect, recall thebehavior of a pendulum swinging at the north pole of Earth. As Earth rotates, the planeof the pendulum‚Äôs swing remains Ô¨Åxed with respect to the distant stars. The stars deÔ¨Åne20If magnetic monopoles exist, the ‚Äúmagnetic charge‚Äù would also be required for a complete speciÔ¨Åcation. How-ever, both magnetic and electric charge can be safely ignored because stars should be very nearly neutral.21The ‚Äúno hair‚Äù theorem actually applies only to the universe outside the event horizon. Inside, the spacetimegeometry is complicated by the mass distribution of the collapsed star.2TheKerr metricfor a rotating black hole was derived from Einstein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations by a New Zealand mathe-matician, Roy Kerr, in 1963.01

The location of the event horizon at the equator isr=12RS=GM/c2.a nonrotating frame of reference for the universe, and it is relative to this frame that thependulum‚Äôs swing remains planar. However, the rotating spacetime close to a massivespinning object produces a local deviation from the nonrotating frame that describes theuniverse at large. Near a rotating black hole, frame dragging is so severe that there isa nonspherical region outside the event horizon called theergospherewhere any particlemustmove in the same direction that the black hole rotates. Spacetime within the ergosphereis rotating so rapidly that a particle would have to travel faster than the speed of light toremain at the same angular coordinate (e.g., at the same value ofœÜin the coordinate systemused by a distant observer). The outer boundary of the ergosphere is called thestatic limit,so named because once beyond this boundary, a particle can remain at the same coordinateas the effect of frame dragging diminishes.Even Earth‚Äôs rotation produces very weak frame dragging. Detecting the effect of framedragging was the mission of the Stanford Gravity Probe B experiment. The polar-orbitspacecraft was launched in April 2004 and ended data collection in October 2005 when thecryogenic liquid helium was used up. The experiment employed four superconducting gyro-scopes made of precisely shaped spheres of fused quartz 3.8 cm in diameter. The gyroscopeswere so nearly freely rotating that they formed an almost perfect spacetime reference frame.Although the predicted precession rate of the gyroscopes was only 0.042‚Ä≤‚Ä≤yr‚àí1, the effectof frame dragging is cumulative. It is anticipated that frame dragging will be measurableby comparing the changes that occurred in the gyroscopes‚Äô different initial orientations.2At this point, you should be warned that the previous descriptions of a black hole‚Äôsstructure inside the event horizon, such as Fig. 22, are based on vacuum solutions toEinstein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations. These solutions were obtained by ignoring the effects of the massof the collapsing star, so the vacuum solutions do not describe the interior of a real black hole.Furthermore, the present laws of physics, including general relativity, break down under2At the time the text was written, the year-long, painstaking process of data analysis was under way. Results ofthe experiment are expected to be announced in late 2006 (for updates, visit the Stanford Gravity Probe B websiteathttp://einstein.stanford.edu/).3

the extreme conditions found very near the center. The details of the singularity cannot befully described until a theory of quantum gravity is found. The presence of a singularityseems assured, however. In 1965 an English mathematician, Roger Penrose, proved thateverycomplete gravitational collapse must form a singularity.Tunnels in SpacetimeThe possibility of using a black hole as a tunnel connecting one location in spacetime withanother (perhaps in a different universe) has inspired both physicists and science Ô¨Åctionwriters. Most conjectures of spacetime tunnels are based on vacuum solutions to Einstein‚ÄôsÔ¨Åeld equations and as such don‚Äôt apply to the interiors of real black holes. Still, they havebecome part of the popular culture, and we will consider them brieÔ¨Çy here. Figure 23depicts a spacetime tunnel called aSchwarzschild throat(also known as anEinstein‚ÄìRosenbridge), which uses the Schwarzschild geometry of a nonrotating black hole to connect tworegions of spacetime. The width of the throat is a minimum at the event horizon, and the‚Äúmouths‚Äù may be interpreted as opening onto two different locations in spacetime. It istempting to imagine this as a tunnel, and writers of speculative Ô¨Åction have dreamed ofwhite holespouring out mass or serving as passageways for starships. However, it appearsthat any attempt to send a tiny amount of matter or energy (even a stray photon) throughthe throat would cause it to collapse. For a real nonrotating black hole, all worldlines endat the inescapable singularity, where spacetime is inÔ¨Ånitely curved. There is simply no wayto bypass the singularity.The story is somewhat different for a rotating black hole. Although spacetime is stillinÔ¨Ånitely curved at the ring singularity, all worldlines need not converge there. In fact, itis difÔ¨Åcult for an infalling object to hit the singularity in a rotating black hole. Theoristshave calculated worldlines for vacuum solutions that miss the singularity and emerge in thespacetime of another universe. But just as for nonrotating black holes, any attempt to pass
FIGURE 23Depiction of a Schwarzschild throat connecting two different regions of spacetime.Any attempted passage of matter or energy through the throat would cause it to collapse.General Relativity and Black Holes


<<<PAGE 714>>>

the smallest amount of matter or energy along such a route would cause the passageway tocollapse, thereby pinching it off. In summary, it seems extremely unlikely that black holescan provide a stable passageway for any matter or energy, even for idealized cases. Formore realistic situations, any voyager attempting a trip through a black hole would end upbeing torn apart by the singularity.Another possibility is that of awormhole, a hypothetical tunnel between two points inspacetime separated by an arbitrarily great distance.24We will brieÔ¨Çy consider nonrotating,spherically symmetric wormholes. They are described bynonvacuumsolutions to Einstein‚ÄôsÔ¨Åeld equation. In other words, a wormhole must be threaded by some sort ofexotic materialwhose tension prevents the collapse of the wormhole. There is no known mechanism thatwould allow a wormhole to arise naturally; it would have to be constructed by an incrediblyadvanced civilization. However, the theoretical possibilities alone are fascinating. Thesesolutions to Einstein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations have no event horizon (permitting two-way tripsthrough the wormhole) and involve survivable tidal forces. Journey times from one endthrough to the other can be less than one year (traveler‚Äôs proper time), although the ends ofthe wormhole may be separated by interstellar or intergalactic distances.The catch, of course, is the problematic existence of the exotic material needed to stabilizethe wormhole. The unusual nature of the exotic material becomes apparent if we considertwo light rays that converge on the wormhole and enter it, only to diverge when theyexit the other end. This implies that the exotic material must be capable of gravitationallydefocusing light, an ‚Äúantigravity‚Äù effect involving the gravitational repulsion of the light bythe material through which the rays pass. Exotic material meeting this requirement wouldhave a negative energy density (œÅc2<0), at least as experienced by the light rays.Althougha negative energy density arises in certain quantum situations, it may or may not be allowedphysically on macroscopic scales. We will leave wormholes as a fascinating possibility andabandon the discussion at this point, recalling Einstein‚Äôs remark that ‚Äúall our thinking is ofthe nature of a free play with concepts.‚Äù25Stellar-Mass Black Hole CandidatesYou may feel as though much of this section was borrowed from the pages of a science Ô¨Åctionnovel. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, and proof of the mere existence ofblack holes has been difÔ¨Åcult to obtain. The problem lies in detecting an object only a fewtens of kilometers across that emits no radiation directly. The best hope of astronomers hasbeen to Ô¨Ånd a black hole in a close binary system. If the black hole in such a system is ableto pull gas from the envelope of the normal companion star, the angular momentum of theirorbital motion would cause a disk of gas to form around the black hole (see Fig. 24).As the gas spirals down toward the event horizon, it is compressed and heated to millionsof kelvins and emits X-rays. Only the gravity of a neutron star or a black hole can produceX-rays in a close binary system, and in fact the compact object in most X-ray binaries is24The termwormholerecalls the holes eaten in some ancient map books by worms, providing a symbolic shortcutbetween the distant locations portrayed on the maps.2You are referred to Morris and Thorne (1988) and Thorne (1994) for more details and further speculationsconcerning wormholes.5General Relativity and Black Holes

However, if an X-ray binary can be found in which the mass ofthe compact object exceeds 3 M‚äô, then a strong case can be made that the compact objectis a black hole.The Ô¨Årst black hole to be tentatively identiÔ¨Åed in this way is Cygnus X-1, near the brightstarŒ∑Cygni in the middle of the swan‚Äôs neck. Another promising candidate is LMC X-3,an X-ray binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Yet another compelling case involves theX-ray binary A0620‚àí00, also known as V616 Mon.2The orbital velocities along the lineof sight ofbothcomponents of A0620‚àí00 have been determined using Doppler-shiftedspectral lines. A simple application of Kepler‚Äôs laws shows that the mass of the compactobject must beat least3.82¬±0.24 M‚äô, well above the 3 M‚äôupper limit for a neutron star.a companion star of type K0 IV with a radial velocity amplitude of 211¬±4k ms‚àí1and anorbital period of 6.473¬±0.001 d. The best estimate of the mass of the unseen companionto the K0 IV star is 12¬±2M‚äô. As more evidence accumulates, it seems that astronomershave Ô¨Ånally found the extraordinary proof required for the existence of a black hole.Hawking RadiationThe black holes of classical general relativity last forever. A very general result derivedby Stephen Hawking states that the surface area of a black hole‚Äôs event horizon can neverdecrease. If a black hole coalesces with any other object, the result is an even larger black2A0620‚àí00 (V616 Mon) is on the border of the constellations Monoceros and Orion, about one-third of the wayalong a line from Betelgeuse to Sirius.6

hole. In 1974, however, Hawking discovered a loophole in this law when he combinedquantum mechanics with the theory of black holes and found that black holes can slowlyevaporate. The key to this process is pair production, the formation of a particle‚Äìantiparticlepair just outside the event horizon of a black hole. Ordinarily the particles quickly recombineand disappear, but if one of the particles falls into the event horizon while its partner escapes,as shown in Fig. 25, this disappearing act may be thwarted. The black hole‚Äôs gravitationalenergy was used to produce the two particles, and so the escaping particle has carried awaysome of the black hole‚Äôs mass. The net effect as seen by an observer at a great distance isthe emission of particles by the black hole, known asHawking radiation, accompanied bya reduction in the black hole‚Äôs mass.The rate at which energy is carried away by particles in this manner is inversely pro-portional to the square of the black hole‚Äôs mass, or 1/M2. For stellar-mass black holes, theemitted particles are photons and the rate of emission is minuscule. As the black hole‚Äôs massdeclines, however, the rate of emission increases. The Ô¨Ånal stage of a black hole‚Äôs evapora-tion proceeds extremely rapidly, releasing a burst of all types of elementary particles. Thistremendous explosion probably leaves behind only an empty region of Ô¨Çat spacetime.The lifetime of a primordial black hole prior to its evaporation,tevap, is quite long,tevap=2560œÄ2/parenleftbigg2GMc2/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggMh/parenrightbigg(30)‚âà2√ó1067/parenleftbiggMM‚äô/parenrightbigg3yr.Since the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years, this process is of no consequence forblack holes formed by a collapsing star. However, a primordial black hole with a mass of

<<<PAGE 717>>>

roughly 1.7√ó1011kg would evaporate in about 13 billion years. Thus primordial blackholes with this mass should be in the Ô¨Ånal, explosive stage of evaporation right now andcould possibly be detected. The Ô¨Ånal burst of Hawking radiation is thought to release high-energy (‚âà100 MeV) gamma rays at a rate of 1013W, together with electrons, positrons,and many other particles. The subsequent decay of these particles should produce additionalgamma rays that would be observable by Earth-orbiting satellites. To date, measurementsof the cosmic gamma-ray background at this energy have not detected anything that can beidentiÔ¨Åed with the demise of a nearby primordial black hole. Although there is as yet nopositive evidence that primordial black holes exist, this negative result is still important.It implies that on average there cannot be more than 200 primordial black holes with thismass in every cubic light-year of space.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralBegelman, Mitchell, and Rees, Martin,Gravity‚Äôs Fatal Attraction: Black Holes in the Uni-verse, ScientiÔ¨Åc American Library, New York, 1996.Charles, Philip A., and Wagner, R.

At even greater distances, the equipotentialsurfaces assume a ‚Äúdumbbell‚Äù shape surrounding both masses.5These equipotential surfaces arelevel surfacesfor binary stars. In a binary system, asone of the stars evolves, it will expand to Ô¨Åll successively larger equipotential surfaces(somewhat like inÔ¨Çating a balloon). To see this, consider that the effective gravity at eachpoint is alwaysperpendicularto the equipotential surface there.6Hydrostatic equilibriumguarantees that the pressure is constant along a surface of constant/Phi1; there is no componentof gravity parallel to an equipotential surface, and so a pressure difference in that direction5We will not be concerned with the other equipotential contours on Fig. 3 that pass through the LagrangianpointsL3,L4, andL5. However, theTrojan asteroidsthat accumulate at two locations along Jupiter‚Äôs orbit arecollections of interplanetary rubble found at Lagrangian pointsL4andL5.

cannot be balanced and maintained. And because the pressure is due to the weight of theoverlying layers of the star, the density must also be the same along each equipotentialsurface in order to produce a constant pressure there.Classes of Binary Star SystemsThe appearance of a binary star system depends on which equipotential surfaces are Ô¨Ålledby the stars. Binary stars with radii much less than their separation are nearly sphericalIf one star expands enough to Ô¨Åll the ‚ÄúÔ¨Ågure-eight‚Äù contour in Fig. 3, then its atmo-spheric gases can escape through the inner Lagrangian pointL1to be drawn toward itscompanion. The teardrop-shaped regions of space bounded by this particular equipotentialsurface are calledRoche lobes.7The transfer of mass from one star to the other can be-gin when one of the stars has expanded beyond its Roche lobe. Such a system is called asemidetached binary. The star that Ô¨Ålls its Roche lobe and loses mass is usually calledthesecondary star, with massM2, and its companion theprimary starhas massM1. Theprimary star may be either more or less massive than the secondary star.It may happen thatboth starsÔ¨Åll, or even expand beyond, their Roche lobes. In this case,the two stars share a common atmosphere bounded by a dumbbell-shaped equipotentialsurface, such as the one passing through the Lagrangian pointL2. Such a system is calledacontact binary. Figure 4 illustrates the three classes of binary stars.Mass Transfer RateA crude estimate of the rate at which mass is transferred in a semidetached binary maybe obtained for the case of two stars of equal mass. Let the radius of the star that hasexpanded beyond its Roche lobe beR. The equipotential surface at the radius of this starwill be modeled by two spheres of radiusRthat overlap slightly by a distanced, as shownin Fig. 5.

Forcomparison,the solar wind transports mass away from theSunatamuchsmallerrate,approximately3√ó10‚àí14M‚äôyr‚àí1.Before moving on to consider the consequences of the transfer of mass in semidetachedbinaries, it is worthwhile to consider the enormous energy that can be released when matterfalls onto a star, especially onto a compact object such as a white dwarf or a neutron star.Example 1.2.Consider a massm=1 kg that starts at rest inÔ¨Ånitely far from a star ofmassMand radiusR. The initial total mechanical energy of the massmisE=K+U=0.Using conservation of energy, we Ô¨Ånd that the kinetic energy of the mass when it arrives atthe star‚Äôs surface isK=‚àíU=GMmR.This kinetic energy will be converted into heat and light upon impact with the star. If the staris a white dwarf withM=0.85 M‚äôandR=6.6√ó106m=0.0095 R‚äô, then the energyreleased by one kilogram of infalling matter isGMmR=1.71√ó1013J.This is 0.019% of the rest energy (mc2) of one kilogram of material. For comparison, theamount of energy released by the thermonuclear fusion of one kilogram of hydrogen is0.007mc2=6.29√ó1014JClose Binary Star Systems

If the star is a neutron star with massM=1.4M‚äôand radiusR=10 km, then theenergy released is much greater:GMmR=1.86√ó1016J.This is 21% of the rest energy of one kilogram, nearly 30 times greater than the energy thathydrogen fusion could provide! The calculations show that infalling matter is capable ofgenerating immense amounts of energy.Observations of celestial X-ray sources have revealed objects with a steady X-ray lu-minosity of approximately 1030W. If this radiation were produced by gases pulled froma companion star that then fell onto a neutron star‚Äôs surface, the amount of mass per sec-ond transferred between the two stars that would be needed to account for the observedluminosity isÀôM=1030W1.86√ó1016J kg‚àí1=5.38√ó1013kg s‚àí1,which is only about 10‚àí9M‚äôyr‚àí1. This is similar to the mass transfer rate found in theprevious example, a fortuitous agreement becauseÀôMfor semidetached systems can varyby several orders of magnitude.2ACCRETION DISKSThe orbital motion of a semidetached binary can prevent the mass that escapes from theswollen secondary star from falling directly onto the primary star. The primary‚Äôs movementis often enough to keep it out of the path of the gases that spill through the inner Lagrangianpoint. If the radius of the primary star is less than about 5% of the binary separationa, themass stream will miss striking the primary‚Äôs surface. Instead, the mass stream goes into orbitaround the primary to form a thinaccretion diskof hot gas in the orbital plane, as shown inFig.6.8Viscosity,aninternalfrictionthatconvertsthedirectedkineticenergyof bulk mass motion into random thermal motion, causes the orbiting gases to lose energyand slowly spiral inward toward the primary. The physical mechanism responsible for theviscosity in accretion disks is as yet poorly understood. The familiar molecular viscositydue to interparticle forces is far too weak to be effective. Other possibilities involve randommotions of the gas, such as turbulence in the disk material caused by thermal convection or bya magnetohydrodynamic instability in the magnetic Ô¨Åelds that interact with the differentially

This system‚Äôsparameters correspond to those of Z Chamaeleontis, described in Example 4.1.The Temperature ProÔ¨Åle and LuminosityJust as a star may be treated as a blackbody in a rough Ô¨Årst approximation, the assumption ofan optically thick accretion disk radiating as a blackbody provides a simple, useful model.At each radial distance, an optically thick disk emits blackbody radiation with a continuousspectrum corresponding to the local disk temperature at that distance.To estimate the temperature of a model accretion disk at a distancerfrom the center ofthe primary star of massM1and radiusR1, let‚Äôs assume that the inward radial velocity ofthe disk gases is small compared with their orbital velocity. Then, to a good approximation,the gases follow circular Keplerian orbits, and the details of the viscous forces acting withinthe disk may be neglected. Furthermore, since the mass of the disk is very small comparedwith that of the primary, the orbiting material feels only the gravity of the central primary star.Thetotal energy(kinetic plus potential) of a massmof orbiting gas is given by,E=‚àíGM1m2r.As the gas spirals inward, its total energyEbecomes more negative. The lost energymaintains the disk‚Äôs temperature and is ultimately emitted in the form of blackbody radiation.Now consider an annular ring of radiusrand widthdrwithin the disk, as shown inFig. 7. If the rate at which mass is transferred from the secondary to the primary star isa constantÀôM, then in timetthe amount of mass that passes through the outer boundaryof the circular ring shown in Fig. 7 isÀôMt. Assuming asteady-state diskthat does notchange with time, no mass is allowed to build up within the ring. Therefore during this timean amount of massÀôMtmust also leave through the ring‚Äôs inner boundary.Conservation of energy requires that the energydEradiated by the ring in timetbe equalto the difference in the energy that passes through the ring‚Äôs outer and inner boundaries:dE=dEdrdr=ddr‚é°parenleftbigg‚àíGM1m2r‚é°parenrightbiggdr=GM1ÀôMt2r2dr,Close Binary Star Systems

This may be done by considering the angular momentum of a parcelof massmabout the primary star; see Fig. 8.

The time for this migration of the disk material probably ranges from a fewdays to a few weeks. While most of the matter spirals inward, a small amount of the masscarries the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù angular momentum to the outer edge of the disk. From there, theangular momentum may be carried away from the system by wind-driven mass loss. If theaccretion disk extends 80% to 90% of the way out to the inner Lagrangian point, angularmomentum may also be returned to the orbital motion of the two stars by tides raised in theClose Binary Star Systems

Because of this outward migration of mass, we will adoptRdisk‚âà2rcirc(26)as a rough estimate of the outer radius of the accretion disk.Eclipsing, Semidetached Binary SystemsIt is comforting to know that there is evidence, obtained from observingeclipsingsemide-tached binary systems, that the objects described above actually exist. Observations of lightcurves for eclipsing semidetached binaries, such as shown in Fig. 9, indicate the presenceof a hot spot where the mass transfer stream collides with the outer edge of the accretiondisk. The light curve can be interpreted as the result of observing consecutive ‚Äúslices‚Äù ofthe disk as they disappear and then reappear from behind the primary star. In fact, Fig. 9can be used to re-create an image of the disk itself, shown in Fig. 10.12Because thehot spot is on the trailing side of the disk during the eclipse (see Fig. 12), more light isreceived from the disk near the beginning of the eclipse (when the hot spot is still visible)than near the end (when the hot spot is still hidden). This produces the deÔ¨Åcit in intensityon the right-hand side of the light curve in Fig. 9.

Because there is more than one model disk that will reproduce a given light curve, a technique calledmaximum entropyis used to choose the smoothest possible model for the Ô¨Ånal disk image.Close Binary Star Systems

(Figure from Rutten, van Paradijs, and Tinbergen,Astron. Astrophys.,260, 213, 1992.)3A SURVEY OF INTERACTING BINARY SYSTEMSThe life history of a close binary system is quite complicated, with many possible variationsdepending on the initial masses and separation of the two stars involved. As mass passesfrom one star to the other, the mass ratioM2/M1will change. The resulting redistributionof angular momentum affects the orbital period of the system as well as the separation ofthe two stars. The extent of the Roche lobes, given by Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10), depends onboth the separation and the mass ratio of the stars, so it too will vary accordingly.The Effects of Mass TransferThe effects of mass transfer can be illustrated by considering the total angular momentumof the system. The contribution of the stars‚Äô rotation to the total angular momentum issmall and may be neglected. The orbital angular momentum is givenwith aneccentricityofe=0 for a circular orbit,L=¬µ‚àöGMa.In this expression,¬µis the reduced mass (Eq. 2.22),¬µ=M1M2M1+M2,andM=M1+M2is the total mass of the two stars.Assuming (to a Ô¨Årst approximation) thatno mass or angular momentum is removed from the system via stellar winds or gravitationalClose Binary Star Systems

radiation, both the total mass and the angular momentum of the system remain constant asmass is transferred between the two stars.13That is,dM/dt=0 anddL/dt=0.Some useful insights concerning the effect of the transfer of mass on the separation ofthe two stars can be gained by taking a time derivative of the expression for the angularmomentum:dLdt=ddt‚é°parenleftBig¬µ‚àöGMa‚é°parenrightBig0=‚àöGM‚é°parenleftbiggd¬µdt‚àöa+¬µ2‚àöadadt‚é°parenrightbigg1adadt=‚àí2¬µd¬µdt.(27)Remembering that the total mass,M, remains constant, we Ô¨Ånd that the time derivative ofthe reduced mass isd¬µdt=1M‚é°parenleftbiggdM1dtM2+M1dM2dt‚é°parenrightbigg.The mass lost by one star is gained by the other. WritingÀôM‚â°dM/dt, this means thatÀôM1=‚àíÀôM2, and sod¬µdt=ÀôM1M(M2‚àíM1).Inserting this into Eq. (27) achieves our result,1adadt=2ÀôM1M1‚àíM2M1M2.(28)Equation ( 28) describes the consequence of mass transfer on the separation of the binarysystem. The angular frequency of the orbit will also be affected, as shown by using Kepler‚Äôsthird law in the form of Eq. ( 7). SinceM1+M2=constant, Kepler‚Äôs third law statesthatœâ‚àùa‚àí3/2so that1œâdœâdt=‚àí321adadt.(29)As the orbital separation decreases, the angular frequency increases.The Evolution of a Binary SystemThe following description illustrates the probable evolution of a binary system that is des-tined to become a cataclysmic variable. The starting point is a widely separated binarysystem with main-sequence stars having an initial orbital period ranging from a few months13In fact, gravitational radiation, which will be discussed in Section 6, is primarily responsible for the loss ofangular momentum in some short-period binary systems (P<14 hours).Close Binary Star Systems

to a few years.At the start, suppose that Star 1 is more massive than Star 2, soM1‚àíM2>0.Star 1 therefore evolves more rapidly and, depending on its mass, may become a red giantor supergiant before it begins to overÔ¨Çow its Roche lobe. This initiates the transfer of massfrom Star 1 to Star 2 (soÀôM1<0). According to Eqs. ( 28) and ( 29), in this situationda/dtis negative anddœâ/dtis positive; the stars spiral closer together with an increasinglyshorter period.Now, from Eq. ( 9), asadecreases andM2/M1increases, the Roche lobe around Star 1shrinks, as measured by the distance of Star 1 from the inner Lagrangian point. The masstransfer rate accelerates under the positive feedback of a shrinking Roche lobe, eventuallyproducing an extended atmosphere around both stars, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The systemis now a contact binary, with the degenerate core of Star 1 and the main-sequence Star 2sharing a common gaseous envelope. The two stars transfer angular momentum to thisenvelope as they slowly spiral inward to a much smaller separation and shorter period.If the cores of the two stars merge, the result will be single star, which may explain theAfter emerging from their gaseous cocoon, the system is a detached binary; Star 2 (thesecondary) lies inside its Roche lobe as Star 1 (the primary) cools to become a white dwarf.Eventually, the originally less-massive secondary star evolves and Ô¨Ålls its Roche lobe, andmass begins to Ô¨Çow in the opposite direction, withÀôM1>0. In this case a negative feedbackmitigates the mass transfer process, because, as Eq. ( 28) implies, the stars will nowspiral farther apart (assuming thatM1is still greater thanM2) as the Roche lobe aroundthe secondary star expands according to Eq. ( 10). If the mass Ô¨Çow is to persist, eitherthe secondary must expand faster than the Roche lobe grows or the stars must move closertogether as angular momentum is removed from the system, either by torques due to stellarwinds conÔ¨Åned by magnetic Ô¨Åelds or by gravitational radiation. Whatever the mechanism,a steady rate of mass transfer from the secondary to the white dwarf is maintained, and thestage is set for the outbursts of a cataclysmic variable, as will be described in Section 4.As the secondary star continues to evolve, another common envelope stage may occur.Figure 11 shows an example of the life history of a close binary system that beginswith two intermediate-mass stars (between 5 and 9 M‚äô) and culminates with two carbon‚Äìsupernova.11In Section 5, we will Ô¨Ånd that nuclear reactions begin in the core of the white dwarf before the Chandrasekharlimit is reached.44Close Binary Star Systems

The larger, less massive white dwarf overÔ¨Çows its Roche lobe and dissolves into a heavy disk that is accreted by the more massive dwarf. The accumulation of mass pushes the primary white dwarf toward the Chandrasekhar limit, and it explodes as a Type Iaobservations of blue stragglers in stellar clusters. Alternatively, the envelope surrounding the stars may be ejected. In fact, several systems have been observed in which a binary is found at the center of a planetary nebula, possibly the result of the ejection of a common envelope. (For the sake of the following discussion, we will consider the situation where envelope ejection occurs.)

Types of Interacting Binary SystemsThere are many types of close binary systems, too many to discuss in any detail. Thefollowing list1describes the main classes of interacting binaries, together with some of thefeatures that make these systems important for astronomers. Many of the classes are namedafter the prototype object for that class.‚Ä¢Algols. These are two normal stars (main-sequence stars or subgiants) in a semide-tached binary system. They provide checks on stellar properties and evolution, andthey yield information on mass loss and mass exchange.ActiveAlgols (the W Serpensstars) provide laboratories for studying rapid (short-lived) stages of stellar and binarystar evolution. These systems are important for studying accretion processes and ac-cretion disks. Mass loss from Algols may contribute to the chemical enrichment ofthe interstellar medium.‚Ä¢RS Canum VenaticorumandBY Draconis Stars. These stars are chromospher-ically active binaries that are important systems for investigating dynamo-drivenmagnetic activity in cool stars (spectral type F and later). Manifestations of enhancedmagnetic activity include starspots, chromospheres, coronae, and Ô¨Çares. These sys-tems also contribute to our understanding of the magnetic activity of the Sun‚Äîtheso-calledsolar‚Äìstellar connection.‚Ä¢W Ursae Majoris Contact Systems. These short-period (0.2‚Äì0.8 day) contact bina-ries display very high levels of magnetic activity and are important stars for studyingthe stellar dynamo mechanism at extreme levels. The drag of magnetic braking maycause these binaries to coalesce into single stars.‚Ä¢Cataclysmic VariablesandNova-like Binaries. These systems have short periodsand contain white dwarf components together with cool M-type secondaries that Ô¨Ålltheir Roche lobes. They provide valuable information on the Ô¨Ånal stages of stellarevolution. These binaries are also important for studying accretion phenomena andaccretion disk properties.‚Ä¢X-ray Binaries with Neutron Star and Black Hole Components. These systemsare powerful (Lx>1028W) X-ray sources that have neutron star or (more rarely)black hole components. The X-rays are due to the accretion of gas onto the degeneratecomponent of the system from a nondegenerate companion. Observations of neutronstar systems supplement the information on their structure and evolution that comesfrom pulsars (such as masses, radii, rotation, and magnetic Ô¨Åelds). Systems such asV404 Cygni,A0620‚àí00, and Cygnus X-1 provide evidence for the existence of blackholes; see Section 6.‚Ä¢Œ∂Aurigae andVVCephei Systems. These long-period interacting binaries contain alate-type supergiant component and a hot (usually spectral type B) companion.Œ∂-Aur1Quoted with permission from E. F.

systems contain G or K supergiant stars, and VV Cep binaries contain M supergiants.Although not originally interacting binaries, they became so when the more massivestar evolved to become a supergiant. When eclipses occur, the atmosphere and windof the cooler supergiant can be probed as the hotter star passes behind.‚Ä¢Symbiotic Binaries. Symbiotic stars are long-period interacting binaries consistingof an M giant (sometimes a pulsating Mira-type variable) and an accreting com-ponent that can be a white dwarf, subdwarf, or low-mass main-sequence star. Thecommon feature of these systems is the accretion of the cool component‚Äôs wind ontoits hot companion. Orbital periods of symbiotic stars typically range between 200and 1500 days. Several of the symbiotic binaries have the cool component Ô¨Ålling itsRoche lobe, making them symbiotic Algol systems.‚Ä¢Barium and S-Star Binaries. These stars are thought to be long-period binaries in‚Ä¢Post-Common-Envelope Binaries. These binary systems usually contain hot whitedwarf or subdwarf components and cooler secondary stars that have presumablypassed through the common envelope phase of binary star evolution. The binarynuclei of planetary nebulae are examples of post-common-envelope binaries. Thesesystems are important for studying short-lived stages of stellar evolution.4WHITE DWARFS IN SEMIDETACHED BINARIESWhen a white dwarf is the primary component of a semidetached binary system, the resultmay be adwarf nova,aclassical nova,o rasupernova, in order of increasing brilliance.It is somewhat unfortunate that the termnova(Latin for ‚Äúnew‚Äù) appears in each name,because the three types of outbursts employ three very different mechanisms.Cataclysmic VariablesDwarf novae and classical novae belong to the general class ofcataclysmic variables,o fwhich more than one thousand systems are known to exist. They survive their release ofenergy (unlike supernovae), and the outburst process can reoccur. Cataclysmic variables arecharacterized by long quiescent intervals punctuated by outbursts in which the brightnessof the system increases by a factor between 10 (for dwarf novae) and 106(for classicalnovae). The mean mass of the primary star is 0.86 M‚äô, which is larger than the average ofabout 0.58 M‚äôfor isolated white dwarfs. The secondary star is usually a main-sequencestar of spectral type G or later and is less massive than the primary star.The two stars orbit each other with periods ranging from 23 minutes to more than Ô¨Åvedays, although the vast majority have orbital periods of between 78 minutes and 12 hours.Interestingly, a ‚Äúperiod gap‚Äù exists in the orbital periods of cataclysmic variables betweenClose Binary Star Systems

1.5 hours and 3.25 hours; it is probably due to an abrupt change in angular momentumtransfer in the system, associated with a complex interplay of disrupted magnetic braking,gravitational radiation, the changing size of Roche lobes, and the evolution of the stars.The outbursts are believed to be due to a sudden increase in the rate at which mass Ô¨Çowsdown through the disk. As the eclipsed disk emerges from behind the secondary star, theradial variation in the disk‚Äôs temperature can be determined. During an outburst, the diskdoes indeed appear to be optically thick, withT‚àùr‚àí3/4, in agreement with Eq. ( 22).But during quiescence the observations are not consistent with the disk model describedabove, probably because the disk is not completely optically thick when it is cooler andcontains less mass.Additional evidence supporting this view comes from the strong, wide emission lines ofhydrogen and helium that are seen in cataclysmic variables during quiescence. These linesare usually doubly peaked, as shown in Fig. 12. However, during an eclipse a singleemission line is observed, either redshifted or blueshifted. This is what would be expectedfrom a rotating disk of optically thin gas; the Doppler-shifted emission lines produced onthe opposite sides of the disk disappear when one side or the other is hidden behind thesecondary star.The source of the emission lines that appear during a cataclysmic variable‚Äôs quiescentphase is not yet clear. During an outburst, these lines appear in absorption, as would beexpected from an optically thick disk that produces absorption lines in the same manner asan optically thick stellar atmosphere. But during quiescence, the rate at which mass Ô¨Çowsdown through the disk has presumably decreased, making the disk less dense and cooler. Atlarger radii the disk may then be optically thin and so produce emission lines. Alternatively,there may be a thin layer of hot gas above the disk that produces the emission lines.

Dwarf NovaeThe Ô¨Årst observation of a dwarf nova (U Geminorum) was made in 1855. However, the basicnature of these objects remained elusive until 1974, when Brian Warner at the Universityof Cape Town showed that the outburst of an eclipsing dwarf nova, Z Chamaeleontis,was due to a brightening of the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. Since most ofthe light from a dwarf nova comes from the accretion disk around the white dwarf, thesesystems provide astronomers with their best opportunity to study the dynamic structure ofaccretion disks.1Observations of the dwarf nova VW Hydri showed that the outburst atvisible wavelengths preceded the ultraviolet brightening by about a day. This indicates thatthe outburst started in the cooler, outer part of the disk and then spread down to the hottercentral regions. For these reasons, astronomers have concluded that the outbursts of dwarfnovae are caused by a sudden increase in the rate at which mass Ô¨Çows down through theaccretion disk.Example 4.1.Z Chamaeleontis is a dwarf nova. It consists of anM1=0.85 M‚äôwhitedwarf primary with a radius ofR=0.0095 R‚äôand a late M-type main-sequence secondarystar of massM2=0.17 M‚äô. The orbital period of the system isP=0.0745 day. Whatdoes this system look like?From Kepler‚Äôs third law, Eq. (2.37), the separation of the two stars isa=‚é°bracketleftbiggP2G(M1+M2)4œÄ2‚é°bracketrightbigg1/3=5.22√ó108m,about 75% of the radius of the Sun.

For Z Cha,R2‚âà‚Ñì2=a‚àí‚Ñì1=1.78√ó108m,which agrees quite well with the size of an M6 main-sequence star.The value ofrcircfor this system is, from Eq. (25),rcirc=a‚é°parenleftbigg‚Ñì1a‚é°parenrightbigg4‚é°parenleftbigg1+M2M1‚é°parenrightbigg=1.18√ó108m,continued1In some systems, the primary white dwarf has a magnetic Ô¨Åeld that is sufÔ¨Åciently strong (a few thousand teslas)to prevent the formation of an accretion disk. Instead, the accretion takes place through a magnetically controlledcolumn that funnels mass onto one (or both) of the white dwarf‚Äôs magnetic poles. TheseAM Herculis stars(orpolars) will be considered in Section 6.6

and so a crude estimate of the outer radius of the disk isRdisk‚âà2rcirc=2.4√ó108m,(Eq. 26), which is about two-thirds of the way to the inner Lagrangian point. This is ingood agreement with observations that indicate that the Z Cha‚Äôs disk emits very little lightfrom beyond this radius.The mass transfer rate inferred for Z Cha during an outburst is roughlyÀôM=1.3√ó10‚àí9M‚äôyr‚àí1,or 7.9√ó1013kg s‚àí1, which implies a maximum disk temperature ofTmax=0.488‚é°parenleftbigg3GMÀôM8œÄœÉR3‚é°parenrightbigg1/4=4.4√ó104K,using Eq.

FIGURE 15An artist‚Äôs conception of Z Chamaeleontis. [Courtesy of Dale W. Bryner (1935‚Äì1999), Weber State University.]during an outburst. Since the disk luminosity is proportional toÀôM(Eq. 23), this increasein the mass transfer rate by a factor of 10‚Äì100 is consistent with the observed brighteningof the system.1The mystery remaining to be solved by astronomers is the origin of the increased rate ofmass transfer through the disk of a dwarf nova during an outburst. Possible explanationsfocus on either an instability in the mass transfer rate from the secondary to the primarystar or an instability in the accretion disk itself that periodically dams up and releases thegases Ô¨Çowing through it.A modulation of the mass transfer rate must depend on the details of the mass Ô¨Çowthrough the inner Lagrangian point,L1. One possibility is an instability in the outer layersof the secondary star, causing it to periodically overÔ¨Çow its Roche lobe. Such an instabilitycould be powered by the hydrogen partial ionization zone (atT‚âà10,000 K) damming upand releasing energy.1When one kilogram of H II ions recombines with free electrons, asmuch as 1.3√ó109J is released. If the ionization zone occurs close enough to the surfaceof the secondary, this could be sufÔ¨Åcient to propel some of the overlying stellar materialthrough theL1point and initiate a dwarf nova outburst. Recall, however, that the secondarystar is usually a main-sequence star of spectral type G or later, so the ionization zone maywell lie too deep to produce the instability.The alternative explanation involving an instability in the outer part of the accretiondisk also utilizes the hydrogen partial ionization zone. The viscosity of the disk materialgoverns the rate at which mass spirals down through the disk. The lower the viscosity, thelower the resistance to the orbital motion of the disk gases; the inward drift of materialdecreases, and more matter accumulates in the disk. If the viscosity periodically switches17difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness.1This is somewhat reminiscent of theŒ∫-mechanism that is involved in stellar pulsation.7

from a low to a high value, the resulting wave of stored material plunging inward couldproduce the brightening of the disk observed for dwarf novae. Although the source of theviscosity in accretion disks is poorly understood, it has been suggested that the switchbetween low and high viscosity may be produced by an instability involving the periodicionization and recombination of hydrogen in the outer part of the disk whereT‚âà10,000 K.In such a scenario, the viscosity is roughly proportional to the disk temperature, which inturn depends on the opacity of the disk material. Below 104K, a plausible chain of reasoningthen suggestsneutral hydrogen‚Üílow opacity‚ÜíefÔ¨Åcient cooling‚Üílow temperature‚Üílow viscosity‚Üímass retained in the outer disk.On the other hand, above 104K,ionized hydrogen‚Üíhigh opacity‚ÜíinefÔ¨Åcient cooling‚Üíhigh temperature‚Üíhigh viscosity‚Üímass released to fall through the disk.The instability occurs because the accumulation of matter tends to slowly heat the outerdisk, while its release results in a rapid cooling. This mechanism should operate only forlow accretion rates (<1012kg s‚àí1‚âà10‚àí11M‚äôyr‚àí1), so dwarf novae outbursts should notoccur for systems with larger values ofÀôM. This limit is in fact observed and is one reasonwhy most astronomers favor the disk instability explanation of dwarf novae outbursts.Classical NovaeHigher accretion rates are associated with classical novae. The earliest record of a novawas that of CK Vulpeculae, which occurred in 1670. Since then hundreds of others havebeen observed. About 30 novae are detected in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) each year,but only two or three per year can be seen in those regions of our own Milky Way Galaxythat are unobscured by dust. Novae are characterized by a sudden increase in brightnessof between 7 and 20 magnitudes, with an average brightening of about 10‚Äì12 magnitudes.The rise in luminosity is very rapid, taking only a few days, with a brief pause orstandstillwhen the star is about two magnitudes from its maximum brilliance. At its peak, a novamay shine with about 105L‚äôand release roughly 1038J (integrated across all wavelengths)over‚àº100 days.Close Binary Star Systems

The subsequent decline occurs more slowly over several months, and its rate of declinedeÔ¨Ånes thespeed classof a nova. Afast novatakes a few weeks to dim by two mag-nitudes, whereas aslow novamay take nearly 100 days to decline by the same amountfrom maximum; see Figs. 17 and 18.

Fast novae aretypically three magnitudes brighter than slow novae, but in either case a nova falls to nearlyits pre-eruption appearance after a few decades.During the Ô¨Årst few months, the decline in brightness occurs only at visual wavelengths.When observations at infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths are included, the bolometric

The speed of the gases is roughly three times greater for fastnovae, but the total mass ejected is about the same for both speed classes. We will see thatthe changing characteristics of this expanding shell of gas are responsible for the featuresseen in Fig. 19.The average value of the absolute visual magnitude of a nova in its quiescent state isMV=4.5. Assuming that the light from such a system comes primarily from the accretiondisk around the white dwarf, an estimate of the mass transfer rate for a typical nova canbe obtained.

This is in good agreement with the accepted theoretical model of a nova, which incorpo-rates a white dwarf in a semidetached binary system that accretes matter at a rate of about10‚àí8to 10‚àí9M‚äôyr‚àí1. The hydrogen-rich gases accumulate on the surface of the whitedwarf, where they are compressed and heated. At the base of this layer, turbulent mixingenriches the gases with the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen of the white dwarf. (Without thismixing, the ensuing explosion would be too feeble to eject the mass observed for the ex-panding shell of hot gases.) Spectroscopic analysis of the shell shows an enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen by a factor of 10 to 100 times the solar abundance of theseelements.At the base of this enriched layer of hydrogen, the material is supported by electrondegeneracy pressure. When about 10‚àí4to 10‚àí5M‚äôof hydrogen has accumulated and thetemperature at the base reaches a few million kelvins, a shell of CNO-cycle hydrogen burn-ing develops. For highly degenerate matter the pressure is independent of the temperature,so the shell source cannot dampen the reaction rate by expanding and cooling. The result isa runaway thermonuclear reaction, with temperatures reaching 108K before the electronslosetheirdegeneracy.WhentheluminosityexceedstheEddingtonlimitofabout1031Wradiationpressurecanlifttheaccretedmaterialandexpelitintospace.The fast and slow speed classes of novae are likely due to variations in the mass of thewhite dwarf and in the degree of CNO enrichment of the hydrogen surface layer. The briefstandstill that occurs before maximum luminosity is probably an effect of the changingopacity of the ejecta.The energy that would be released in the complete fusion of a hydrogen layer ofm=10‚àí4M‚äôis 0.007mc2‚âà1041J, roughly 103times larger than the energies actually observed.If all of the hydrogen were in fact consumed, the nova would shine for several hundredyears. Most of the accumulated material must therefore be propelled into space by theexplosion. However, the kinetic energy of the ejecta (far from the nova) is much smallerthan the gravitational binding energy of the surface layer, indicating that the total energygiven to the ejecta is just barely enough to allow it to escape from the system.Only about 10% of the hydrogen layer is ejected by the nova explosion. Followingthis initialhydrodynamic ejection phasewhich dominates for fast novae, hydrostaticequilibrium is established and thehydrostatic burning phasebegins. During this prolongedstage of hydrogen burning, which is most important for slow novae, energy is produced at aconstant rate approximately equal to the Eddington luminosity. The layer above the shell ofCNO burning becomes fully convective and expands by a factor of 10 to 100, extending tosome 109m.2At the surface of the convective envelope the effective temperature is about105K, much less than the 4√ó107K in the active CNO shell source below.Finally, the last of the accreted surface layer is ejected, from between a few months toabout a year after the hydrostatic burning phase began. Deprived of fuel, the hydrostaticburning phase ends, and the white dwarf begins to cool. Eventually the binary system revertsto its quiescent conÔ¨Åguration and the accretion process begins anew. For accretion rates ofThis mechanism is similar to the helium core Ô¨Çash.2The white dwarf remnant may overÔ¨Çow its Roche lobe.

10‚àí8to 10‚àí9M‚äôyr‚àí1, it will take some 104to 105years to build up another surface layerof 10‚àí4M‚äô.The physical character of theejected gasespasses through three distinct phases as aconsequence of the nova explosion. During the initialÔ¨Åreball expansion phase, the materialblown off the star in the hydrodynamic ejection phase forms an optically thick ‚ÄúÔ¨Åreball‚Äùthat radiates as a hot blackbody of 6000‚Äì10,000 K. The observed light originates in the‚Äúphotosphere‚Äù of the expanding Ô¨Åreball; at this point, the spectrum of the nova resemblesthat of an A or F supergiant.The expanding model photosphere has a radius that initially increases linearly withtime and then approaches a limiting value ofR‚àû=3Œ∫ÀôMeject8œÄv.(30)If the luminosity,L,o ft h en o v ai sa l s oa s s u m e dt ob ec o n s t a n t ,t h e ntheeffectivetemperatureofthemodelphotosphereapproachesT‚àû=‚é°parenleftbiggL4œÄœÉ‚é°parenrightbigg1/4‚é°parenleftBigg8œÄv3Œ∫ÀôMeject‚é°parenrightBigg1/2.(31)For an opacity ofŒ∫=0.04 m2kg‚àí1am a s se j e c t i o nr a t eo fÀôMeject‚âà1019kgs‚àí1(about10‚àí4M‚äôyr‚àí1), and an ejection speed ofv‚âà1000 km s‚àí1, the Ô¨Åreball‚Äôs photosphere ap-proaches a limiting radius of about 5√ó1010m, or 1/3 AU. TakingLto be the Eddingtonlimit of about 1031W, the effective temperature of the model photosphere approaches avalue of nearly 9000 K.The optically thick Ô¨Åreball phase ends in a few days, at the point of maximum visualbrightness. Then, as the shell of gas thrown off by the nova continues to expand, it becomesless and less dense. The rate of mass ejection,ÀôMeject, has also declined in the hydrostaticburning phase. The result, according to Eqs. ( 30) and ( 31), is that the location of thephotosphere moves inward and its temperature increases slightly. Although these generaltrends are correct, the opacity is in fact very sensitive to the temperature forT<104Kthin phasebegins. The central white dwarf, swollen by its hydrostatic burning phase, nowhas the appearance of a blue horizontal-branch object located just blueward of the RR Lyraestars on the H‚ÄìR diagram. The white dwarf envelope may burn irregularly, resulting in thesubstantial Ô¨Çuctuations in brightness observed for some novae.After a few months, when the temperature of the expanding envelope of gases has fallen toabout 1000 K, carbon in the ejecta can condense to form dust consisting of graphite grains.22The identiÔ¨Åcation of the grain composition comes in part from an infrared emission ‚Äúbump‚Äù at a wavelength of5¬µm.Novae are natural laboratories for testing theories of grain formation.,

The resulting dust shell becomes optically thick inroughly 50% of all novae. The visible light from a nova is undiminished by an optically thinshell, but the formation of an optically thick cocoon of dust obscures or completely hides thecentral white dwarf. In the latter case, the output of visible light suddenly plunges, as seen inFig. 19. The light from the white dwarf is absorbed and re-emitted by the graphite grains,so the optically thick dust shell radiates as a‚àº900 K blackbody at infrared wavelengths.In this way, the nova‚Äôs bolometric luminosity remains constant as long as the white dwarfcontinues to produce energy at roughly the Eddington rate while in its hydrostatic burningphase. Figure 20 shows that the expanding shell may remain visible for years after thehydrostatic burning phase has ended, its gases and dust enriching the interstellar medium.Polars: X-Rays from White Dwarf SystemsAM Herculis stars(also calledpolars), are semidetached binaries containing white dwarfswith magnetic Ô¨Åelds of about 2000 T. The torque produced by the white dwarf‚Äôs Ô¨Åeldinteracting with the secondary star‚Äôs envelope results in a nearly synchronous rotation;the two stars perpetually face each other, connected by a stream of hot gas.2As this gasapproaches the white dwarf, it moves almost straight down toward the surface and formsan accretioncolumna few tens of kilometers across. A shock front occurs above the whitedwarf‚Äôs photosphere, where the gas is decelerated and heated to a temperature of several108K. The hot gas emits hard X-ray photons; some escape, and some are absorbed by thephotosphere and re-emitted at soft X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths.2If the white dwarf has a somewhat weaker Ô¨Åeld (Bs<1000 T), or if the stars are farther apart, an accretion diskmay form, only to be disrupted near the star (as shown in Fig. 22). These systems, calledDQ Herculis stars,orintermediate polars, do not exhibit synchronous rotation.2

The visible light observed from these systems is in the form ofcyclotron radiationemitted by nonrelativistic electrons spiraling along the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines of the accretioncolumn.

However, a small fractionof the energy is emitted at higher harmonics (multiples) ofŒΩcand may be detected at visiblewavelengths by astronomers on Earth. The cyclotron radiation is circularly polarized whenobserved parallel to the direction of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines, and linearly polarized whenviewed perpendicular to the Ô¨Åeld lines.2Thus, as the two stars orbit each other (typicallyevery 1 to 2 hours), the measured polarization changes smoothly between being circularlyand linearly polarized. In fact, it is this strong variable polarization (up to 30%) that givespolars their name.5TYPE IA SUPERNOVAEWe have seen that there are many differences among the characteristics of individual novae.The peak luminosity, the rate of decline, the presence of rapid Ô¨Çuctuations, and/or thecomplete disappearance of the nova at visible wavelengths‚Äîall of these vary greatly fromsystem to system. On the other hand, another type of cataclysmic variable, theType Iasupernova, varies relatively little and in a systematic way. This means that it is possibleto use these exploding stars as calibrated luminosity sources (‚Äústandardizable candles‚Äù),allowing astronomers to establish the distances to the systems in which they are found.ObservationsType Ia supernovae are remarkably consistent in their energy output; at maximum lightmost Type Ia‚Äôs reach an average maximum in the blue and visual wavelength bands of‚ü®MB‚ü©‚âÉ‚ü®MV‚ü©‚âÉ‚àí19.3¬±0.03,with a typical spread of less than about 0.3 magnitudes. As can be seen in Fig. 21, a clearrelationship exists between the peak brightness and the rate of decline in the light curve(the brightest Type Ia‚Äôs decline the slowest), making it possible to accurately determine themaximum luminosity of an individual Type Ia by measuring the rate of decline. Knowingthe luminosity (or absolute magnitude), we can compute the distance to the supernova.Given their tremendous brightness, Type Ia supernovae serve as critically important tools2The electric Ô¨Åeld vector of linearly polarized light oscillates in a single plane, whereas for circularly polarizedlight this plane of polarization rotates about the direction of travel.3

If sufÔ¨Åcientmass falls onto the white dwarf, its mass can be driven to near the Chandrasekhar limit,producing a catastrophic explosion. Still unclear at the time this text was written is the exactmechanism (or mechanisms) that trigger the explosion.Close Binary Star Systems
Type Ia supernovae do not exhibit hydrogen lines in their spectra and,  instead, show the strong presence of Si II lines, along with neutral and ionized lines of O, Mg, S, Ca and Fe. Given that hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, the absence of hydrogen indicates that Type Ia supernovae are

Two general scenarios have been proposed. In one scenario, known asdouble-degeneratemodels, two white dwarf stars exist in a binary orbit. One of the most dramaticpredictions of Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity is the existence ofgravitational waves(orgravitational radiation). According to general relativity, mass acts on spacetime,telling it how to curve. If the distribution of a system‚Äôs mass varies, the resulting changesin the surrounding spacetime curvature may propagate outward as a gravitational wave,carrying energy and angular momentum away from the system. (If the collapse of a star isspherically symmetric, it will not produce gravitational waves; there must be a departurefrom spherical symmetry.) When applied to a close binary system, general relativity showsthat the emission of gravitational radiation will cause the stars to spiral together. If theorbital period is under about 14 hours, the loss of energy via gravitational waves governsthe subsequent evolution of a system with solar-mass components. For example, as a whitedwarf and a neutron star spiral closer together, the white dwarf may break up and donatesome of its mass and angular momentum to its companion. The result could be an isolatedmillisecond pulsar. A system of two neutron stars, known as the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor pulsar, hasconÔ¨Årmed this prediction of general relativity to incredibly high precisionIn the case where two white dwarf stars are spiraling together, the less massive star(which has the larger radius) will eventually spill over its Roche lobe and be completelytorn apart in just a few orbits. The resulting thick disk dumps its C‚ÄìO-rich material ontothe more massive primary. As the mass of the primary grows and nears the Chandrasekharlimit, nuclear reactions begin in the deep interior, eventually destroying the primary whitedwarf (this scenario was illustrated in Fig. 11).Double-degenerate models appear to predict about the right number of mergers, con-sistent with the observed Type Ia supernova rate in galaxies, and they naturally accountfor the lack of hydrogen in the spectra of Type Ia‚Äôs. However, computer simulations ofnuclear burning suggest that the ignition may be off-center, resulting in ultimate collapseto a neutron star, rather than complete disruption of the white dwarf as a supernova. Inaddition, it appears that the production of heavy elements may be inconsistent with therelative abundances observed in supernova spectra.The other general scenario, known assingle-degeneratemodels, involves an evolvingstar in orbit about a white dwarf, much like the models of dwarf novae and novae. However,in this case, the mass falling onto the white dwarf results in complete destruction of thewhite dwarf in a Type Ia supernova. To date, this set of models is generally favored, but thedetails of the eruption are still unclear.One version of single-degenerate models suggests that as the material from the secondaryfalls onto the primary, the helium in the gas will settle on top of the C‚ÄìO white dwarf,becoming degenerate. When enough helium has accumulated, a helium Ô¨Çash will occur.Not only will this cause the helium to burn to carbon and oxygen, but it will also senda shock wave downward into the degenerate C‚ÄìO white dwarf, causing ignition of thedegenerate carbon and oxygen.A second version of the single-degenerate models doesn‚Äôt invoke degenerate heliumburning on the surface but simply has carbon and oxygen igniting in the interior of thewhite dwarf as the star nears the Chandrasekhar limit, at which point the degenerate gas isno longer able to support the mass of the star. As the star approaches the fatal limit, two-.Close Binary Star Systems

and three-dimensional simulations suggest that multiple, independent ignition points mayoccur deep within the core, resulting in nonspherical events.What happens next is also a matter of signiÔ¨Åcant debate and ongoing research. It is as yetunclear if the resulting burning front of carbon and oxygen occurs at subsonic speeds (knownas adeÔ¨Çagrationevent) or if the front accelerates and steepens to become a supersonicburning front (known as adetonation, or a true explosion). Precisely how the burning frontadvances affects the details of the resulting light curve (the maximum luminosity and rate ofdecay following maximum) as well as the relative abundances of the elements produced asobserved in the spectrum. Of course, the question of deÔ¨Çagration versus detonation appliesto successful double-degenerate models as well.In all versions of the single-degenerate scenario, one of the general challenges has beento have just the right rate of accretion from the secondary. If the accretion rate isn‚Äôt appro-priately Ô¨Åne-tuned, the result could be a dwarf nova or a classical nova.It is possible that both double- and single-degenerate mechanisms may be at work innature. It is also possible that some single-degenerate events (if they occur) may invokehelium Ô¨Çashes while others may simply ignite carbon and oxygen in the interior withoutthe helium trigger. Perhaps even deÔ¨Çagration and detonation events occur. In any case, theconsistency of the light curves ultimately arises from the eruption of a C‚ÄìO white dwarfnear 1.4M‚äô. The variations may arise from slight variations in mass and/or variations inmechanisms.Much work remains to be done in understanding Type Ia supernovae, which are socritically important to so many aspects of modern astrophysics.6NEUTRON STARS AND BLACK HOLES IN BINARIESIf one of the stars in a close binary system is sufÔ¨Åciently massive that it explodes as acore-collapse supernova, the result may be either a neutron star or a black hole orbitingthe companion star. In a semidetached system, hot gas can then spill through the innerLagrangian point from the distended atmosphere of the companion star onto the compactobject. A variety of intriguing phenomena are powered by the energy released when thegas falls down the deep gravitational potential well onto the compact object. As will beseen shortly, many of these systems emit copious quantities of X-rays. In fact, thesebinaryX-ray systemsshine most strongly in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.Other systems may consist oftwocompact objects, such as the binary pulsars.Formation of Binaries with Neutron Stars or Black HolesWhether or not a binary system survives the supernova explosion of one of its component

system isEi=12M1v21+12M2v22‚àíGM1M2a=‚àíGM1M22a.(33)The speeds of the two stars are related by Eq. (7.4),M1v1=M2v2. Now suppose that Star 1explodes as a core-collapse supernova, leaving a remnant of massMR. For a sphericallysymmetric explosion, there is no change in the velocity of Star 1. Before the spherical shellof ejecta reaches Star 2, its mass acts gravitationally as though it were still on Star 1So far, the supernova has had no effect on the binary. However, as soonas the shell has swept beyond Star 2, the gravitational inÔ¨Çuence of the ejecta is no longerdetectable.Thus the main consequence of the supernova on the orbital dynamics of the binarysystem arises from the ejection of mass, the removal of some of the gravitational glue thatwas binding the stars together.2Since the velocity of Star 2 is initially unchanged andthe separation of the two stars remains the same, the total energy of the system after theexplosion is nowEf=12MRv21+12M2v22‚àíGMRM2a.(34)If the explosion results in anunboundsystem, thenEf‚â•0. It is left as an exercise to showthat the mass of the remnant must satisfyMRM1+M2‚â§1(2+M2/M1)(1+M2/M1)<12(35)for an unbound system. That is,at leastone-half of the total mass of the binary systemmust be ejected if the supernova explosion of Star 1 is to disrupt the system. If one-halfor more of the system‚Äôs mass is retained, the result will be a neutron star or a black holegravitationally bound to a companion star. For a massive companion star (M2‚â´M1), thisis a likely result.Capturing Isolated Neutron StarsIt is possible that isolated neutron stars, formed by core-collapse supernovae, may be grav-itationally captured during a chance encounter with another star. Because the total energyof two unbound stars is initially greater than zero, some of the excess kinetic energy mustbe removed for a capture to occur.other star, the resulting binary system will have a period ranging from several hours (witha main-sequence star) to several days (with a giant).2The direct impact of the supernova blast on the companion star has been neglected, although this too willcontribute to disrupting the system.5
5.Close Binary Star Systems
If the proximity of the two objects raises a tidal bulge on the nondegenerate star, energy may be dissipated by the damping mechanisms for pulsating stars. The out-come of such a tidal capture depends on the nearness of the passage and the type of star involved. If the neutron star passes between about 1 to 3 times the radius of the

systems containing a neutron star over a period of some 1010years. This is consistent withthe number of X-ray sources observed in globular clusters. (The estimated lifetime of abinary X-ray system is on the order of 109years, so only the most compact globular clusterswould be expected to harbor even one X-ray source at a given time.)An alternative capture mechanism involves three (or more) stars. One of the stars wouldbe gravitationally Ô¨Çung from the system, removing energy and so allowing the capture totake place.Yet another possibility was envisioned by by Kip Thorne and AnnaÀôZytkow of Caltech in1977. Although a direct hit would destroy a main-sequence star, the penetration of a neutronstar into a giant star would bring it close to the star‚Äôs degenerate core. The result could bea neutron star orbiting inside the giant star: a system that is known as aThorne‚ÄìÀôZytkowobject. It is thought that the envelope of the giant star would be quickly expelled, producinga neutron star‚Äìwhite dwarf binary with an orbital period of about 10 minutes. (To date, theseobjects remain hypothetical.)Binary X-Ray PulsarsClose binary systems containing neutron stars were Ô¨Årst identiÔ¨Åed by their energetic emis-sion of X-rays. The Ô¨Årst source of X-rays beyond the Solar System was discovered in1962 in the constellation Scorpius by a Geiger counter arcing above Earth‚Äôs atmospherein a sounding rocket. (X-rays cannot penetrate the atmosphere, so detectors and telescopesdesigned for X-ray wavelengths must make their observations from space.2) This object,called Sco X-1, is now known to be abinary X-ray pulsar(also called simply an X-raypulsar). The periodic eclipse of another X-ray pulsar, Cen X-3 in the constellation Cen-taurus, revealed its binary nature. [It is important to note that the Crab pulsar also emitsX-rays (along with a small number of other isolated pulsars), but the Crab is primarily aradio pulsar that radiates in every region of the electromagnetic spectrum.]X-ray pulsars are powered by the gravitational potential energy released by accretingmatter. Recall from Example 1.2 that when mass falls from a great distance to the surface
X-ray pulsars also emit radio wavelength energy, just like isolated pulsars. However,radio wavelength emissions are easily quelched by the accretion disk in the binary system,and so the radio emissions are not as prominant as they are for isolated pulsars.2The Ô¨Årst X-ray detector was designed to look for X-rays from the lunar surface, produced when solar windparticles cause the lunar soil to Ô¨Çuoresce. The presence of enormously stronger cosmic X-ray sources came as asurprise to astronomers at the time.6
6Close Binary Star SystemsThis tidal capture process is most effective in regions that are extremely densely populated with stars, such as the centers of globular clusters. It is estimated that in a compact globular cluster, tidal capture could produce up to about ten close binary
of a neutron star, about 20% of its rest energy is released, an amount that far exceeds the fraction of a percent that would be produced by fusion. The observed X-ray lu-minosities range up to 1031 W [the Eddington limit]. For a neutron star with a radius of 10 km, the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann equation shows that the temperature associated with this luminosity is about 2 √ó 107 K. According to Wien‚Äôs law, the spectrum of a blackbody with this temperature would peak at an X-ray wavelength of about 0.15 nm.

Example 6.1.Before considering the details of channeled accretion onto a neutronstar, let‚Äôs look at the case of accretion onto the white dwarf considered in Example 2.1,for whichM=0.85 M‚äô,R=0.0095 R‚äô=6.6√ó106m, andÀôM=1013kg s‚àí1(1.6√ó10‚àí10M‚äôyr‚àí1). Assume that its magnetic Ô¨Åeld has a surface strength ofBs=1000 T,about 100 times stronger than the typical value for a white dwarf. Then, from Eq. ( 39),the Alfv√©n radius isrA=6.07√ó108m.This is comparable to the separation of the stars in a cataclysmic variable (see Exam-ple 4.1), so an accretion disk cannot form around a white dwarf with an extremely strongmagnetic Ô¨Åeld. Instead, the mass spilling through the inner Lagrangian point is conÔ¨Ånedto a stream that narrows as it is magnetically directed toward one (or both) of the polesof the white dwarf. In the absence of an accretion disk, all of the accretion energy will bedelivered to the pole(s) of the star, with an accretion luminosity of (Eq. 24)Lacc=GMÀôMR=1.71√ó1026W.A Polar Analog in a Neutron Star SystemExample 6.2.Consider the case of accretion onto the neutron star described in Ex-ample 2.1. For this star,M=1.4M‚äô,R=10 km, andÀôM=1014kg s‚àí1(1.6√ó10‚àí9M‚äôyr‚àí1). Furthermore, take the value of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld at the neutron star‚Äôssurface to beBs=108T. The value of the Alfv√©n radius is then given by Eq. (39),rA=3.09√ó106m.Although 300 times the radius of the neutron star itself, this is much less than the valueofrcirc(Eq. 25) that describes the extent of an accretion disk. Thus an accretion diskwill form around the neutron star but will be disrupted near the neutron star‚Äôs surface asshown in Fig. 22 (unless the magnetic Ô¨Åeld is quite weak, roughly<104T). As theaccreting gas is funneled onto one of the magnetic poles of the neutron star, it forms anaccretion column similar to the one described for polars. In this case, however, the accretionluminosity (Eq. 24) is four orders of magnitude greater,Lacc=GMÀôMR=1.86√ó1030W,close to the Eddington limit of‚àº1031W.AsLaccapproachesLEd,radiationpressureelevatestheshockfronttoheightsreachingr‚àº2R.A sar e s u l t ,X - r a y sa r ee m i t t e doveralargesolidangle.Close Binary Star Systems

You may verify that ifa 0.85 M‚äôwhite dwarf with a radius of 6.6√ó106m andBs=1000 T is used for theaccreting star, rather than a neutron star, thenÀôP /P=‚àí1.03√ó10‚àí5yr‚àí1. The measuredvalue is larger by a factor of 27. A white dwarf is hundreds of times larger than a neutronstar, so it has a much larger moment of inertia and is more difÔ¨Åcult to spin up. The substan-tially better agreement between the neutron star model and the observations obtained forthese systems is compelling evidence that neutron stars are the accreting objects in binaryX-ray pulsars.Close Binary Star Systems

The curve is for the best-Ô¨Åt circular orbit, and the dots about the straightline show the residuals from the best-Ô¨Åt orbit. (Figure adapted from Primini et al.,Ap.

This results in a cyclic variation in the measured pulse period that isanalogous to the Doppler shift of a spectral line observed for a spectroscopic binaryFigure24showstheshiftinpulsearrivaltimesasafunctionoftheorbitalphase for the X-ray pulsar SMC X-1 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The orbit for thissystem is almost perfectly circular, with a radius of 53.5 light-seconds=0.107 AU, lessthan one-third the size of Mercury‚Äôs orbit around the Sun.A complete description of the binary system has been obtained for a small number ofeclipsingX-ray pulsars with visible companions. Such systems are analogous to double-line, eclipsing, spectroscopic binaries. For example, in the SMC X-1 system the mass of thesecondary star is 17.0 M‚äô(with an uncertainty of about 4 M‚äô), and its radius is 16.5 R‚äô(¬±4R‚äô). The masses of the neutron stars have also been determined for these systems. Theresults are consistent with a neutron star mass of 1.4 M‚äô(¬±0.2M‚äô), in good agreementwith the Chandrasekhar limit.X-Ray BurstersIf the magnetic Ô¨Åeld of the neutron star is too weak (‚â™108T) to completely disrupt theaccretion disk and funnel the accreting matter onto its magnetic poles, these gases will settleover the surface of the star. Without an accretion column to produce a hot spot, X-ray pulsescannot be produced by the rotation of the neutron star. Instead, calculations indicate thatwhen a layer of hydrogen a few meters thick accumulates on the surface, a shell of hydrogenslowly begins burning about a meter below the surface, with a shell of helium burning ignitedanother meter below that; see Fig. 25. This fusion of helium is explosive and releases.Close Binary Star Systems

The resulting blackbody spectrum peaksat X-ray wavelengths, and a Ô¨Çood of X-rays is liberated by thisX-ray burster. Some of theX-rays may be absorbed by the accretion disk and re-emitted as visible light, so an opticalÔ¨Çash is sometimes seen a few seconds after the X-ray burst. As the burst luminosity declinesin a matter of seconds, the spectrum matches that of a cooling blackbody with a radius of‚àº10 km, consistent with the presence of a neutron star. After a time that can vary from afew hours to a day or more, another layer of hydrogen accumulates and another X-ray burstis triggered. More than 50 X-ray bursters have been found so far. Most are concentratednear the Galactic plane, toward the center of our Galaxy, with some 20% located in oldglobular clusters.Low-Mass and Massive X-Ray BinariesFrom these and other results, astronomers have identiÔ¨Åed two classes of binary X-raysystems. The more common type consists of those with low-mass secondary stars (latespectral-type stars withM2‚â§2M‚äô). These systems belong to thelow-mass X-ray binaries(LMXBs). LMXBs produce X-ray bursts rather than pulses, indicating that the neutronstar‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld is relatively weak. Because low-mass stars are small, the two starsmust orbit more closely if mass is to be transferred from one star to the other. For thisreason, the LMXBs have short orbital periods, from 33.5 days down to 11.4 minutes. AboutIt is thought that the gases accreting on X-ray pulsars are constantly undergoing fusion. However, recall fromExample 1.2 that the energy released in the accretion column will be about 30 times larger, so the energy fromfusion will be lost in the glare of the accretion energy.28

one-quarter of these systems are found within globular clusters, where the high numberdensity of stars makes the gravitational capture of a neutron star more likely. The neutronstars in LMXBs may also have been formed by the accretion-induced collapse of a whitedwarf.Systems with higher-mass secondaries are referred to asmassive X-ray binaries(MXRBs). About half of the approximately 130 known MXRBs are X-ray pulsars. Withgiant or supergiant O and B stars available to Ô¨Åll their Roche lobes, the separation of thestars can be larger and the orbital periods correspondingly longer, from 0.2 days up to580 days. Even if the secondary star‚Äôs envelope does not overÔ¨Çow its Roche lobe, thevigorous stellar winds of these stars may still provide the mass transfer rate needed tosustain the production of X-rays. The MXRBs are found near the plane of our Galaxy,where there are young massive stars and ongoing star formation. This is consistent with theidea that an MXRB is the product of the normal evolution of a binary system containing amassive star that survived the supernova explosion of its companion.So far, only neutron stars have been considered as the accreting object in binary X-raysystems. However, the gravitational potential well is even deeper for matter falling towarda black hole. In this case, up to about 30% of the rest energy of the falling disk materialblack hole rests on determining that the mass of a compact, X-ray-emitting object exceedsthe approximately 3 M‚äôupper limit for the mass of a rapidly rotating neutron star. Thusthe procedure for detecting a black hole in a binary X-ray system is similar to that used tomeasure the masses of neutron stars in these systems.At present, there are only a handful of X-ray binaries that allow such a dynamical deter-mination of the masses involved. The best cases at the time of this writing are A0620‚àí00,V404 Cygni, Cygnus X-1, and LMC X-3. Since none of these systems exhibit eclipses,the resulting uncertainty about their orbital inclinations means that the masses calculatedof the secondary star allows the measurement of the radial velocity ofboththe accretiondisk and the companion star. The identiÔ¨Åcation of A0620‚àí00 as a 3.82¬±0.24 M‚äôblackThe arguments for the other two systems, although strong, are not as conclusive. Neitherhas a fully developed accretion disk, and so the velocities of both members cannot bedetermined. Cygnus X-1, perhaps the best-known black hole candidate, is a bright MXRB.Because almost all of the light comes from the secondary, Cyg X-1 is essentially a single-line spectroscopic binary. The identiÔ¨Åcation of Cyg X-1 as a black hole therefore dependson the identiÔ¨Åcation of the secondary star (HDE 226868) as a O9.7 Iab supergiant with amass of 17.8M‚äô. The most likely result, making reasonable assumptions about this binarysystem, is that the mass of the compact object in Cyg X-1 is 10.1M‚äô. Even the worst-caseargument results in a secure lower limit of 3.4 M‚äô, providing the evidence that Cyg X-1 isa black hole.Close Binary Star Systems

The secondary star in the LMC X-3 system is a B3 main-sequence star that is orbitingan unseen, more massive companion. Although the lower limit on the mass of the compactcompanion is 3 M‚äô, a more probable mass range is 4‚Äì9 M‚äô‚Äîagain, solid evidence for ablack hole. Other X-ray binary systems may contain black holes, such as Nova Mus 1991 inthe southern constellation Musca (the Fly), LMC X-3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, andCAL 87 (in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud), but the evidence in these cases isnot yet as strong.SS 433One more X-ray binary and possible black hole candidate should be mentioned: SS 433,one of the most bizarre objects known to astronomers. In 1978, it was discovered that thisobject displaysthreesets of emission lines. One set of spectral lines was greatly blueshifted,another set was greatly redshifted, and a third set lacked a signiÔ¨Åcant Doppler shift. Herewas an object with three components: Two were approaching and receding, respectively,at one-quarter the speed of light while the third stayed nearly still! The wavelengths of theshifted lines vary with a period of 164 days, while the wavelengths of the nearly stationarylines show a smaller shift with a 13.1-day period. Furthermore, the position of SS 433 lies atthe center of a diffuse, elongated shell of gas known as W50, which is probably a supernovaremnant.The 13.1-day period of SS 433 describes the orbit of a compact object (most probably aneutron star, but perhaps a black hole) around the primary. The primary is thought to be a10‚Äì20 M‚äôearly-type star with a stellar wind that produces the broad stationary emissionlines.3Surrounding the compact object is an accretion disk that contributes to the visiblelight from the system equally with the secondary. A tidal interaction between the diskand the two stars could be responsible for a precessional wobble of the disk that has a

period of 164 days, analogous to Earth‚Äôs 25,770-year precessional wobble There is broad agreement that the varying Doppler-shifted emission lines, shown in Fig. 26, come from two relativistic jets that expel particles at 0.26c in opposite directions along the axis of the disk. The jets are probably powered by the accretion of matter at a rate exceeding the Eddington limit, generating X-rays at a prodigious rate. This could produce a radiation pressure sufÔ¨Åcient to expel a portion of the accreting gases at relativistic speeds in the direction of least resistance‚Äîperpendicular to the disk. As the disk precesses, two oppo-sitely directed jets sweep out a cone in space every 164 days, resulting in cyclic variations in both the radial velocity of the jets and the observed Doppler shift. The collimation of the jets could be the result of the ionized gases moving along magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines. The axis of the precessional cone makes an angle of 79  with the line of sight; the cone‚Äôs axis is also closely aligned with the long axis of the probable supernova remnant, W50. In fact, there are two regions that have been observed to emit X-rays, presumably.

Figure 27shows the general features of this incredible system.The Fate of Binary X-Ray SystemsWhat is the fate of a binary X-ray system? As it reaches the endpoint of its evolution,the secondary star will end up as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. The effect onthe system depends on the mass of the secondary star. In low-mass systems (LMXBs), thecompanion star will become a white dwarf without disturbing the circular orbit of the system.On the other hand, the higher-mass secondary in a MXRB may explode as a supernova.If more than half of the system‚Äôs mass is retained (Eq. 35), a pair of neutron stars willcircle each other in orbits that probably have been elongated by the blast. Otherwise, thesupernova may disrupt the system and hurl the solitary neutron stars into space. This isconsistent with observations that pulsars (like MXRBs) are concentrated near the plane ofour Galaxy and may have high space velocities that can exceed 1000 km s‚àí1.Millisecond Radio PulsarsThe principal way in which a binary system containing two neutron stars can be detectedis if at least one of them is a pulsar. Astronomers therefore search for cyclic variations inthe measured periods of radio pulsars, analogous to the effect described here for the X-raypulsars. Although half of all stars in the sky are actually multiple systems,noneof the Ô¨Årstone hundred pulsars discovered belonged to a binary. The Ô¨Årst binary pulsar, PSR 1913+16,was discovered in 1974 by American astronomers Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, usingthe Arecibo radio telescope. The search strategy for binary pulsars changed with the 1982Close Binary Star Systems

With a period of 1.558 milliseconds, this pulsar spins 642 times eachsecond.31Although this astounding rotation rate seemed to indicate a young pulsar, the verysmall value of the period derivative (ÀôP=1.051054√ó10‚àí19) implies a weak magnetic Ô¨Åeldfrom the secondary star could have spun up the neutron star to its present rapid rate. Theneutron star‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld may also have been rejuvenated by this process, although thedetails of how this might occur are not yet clear.A likely evolutionary picture has emerged that brings the observations of binary X-raysources and binary pulsars together. In this scenario, there are two classes of binary pulsars.31Middle C on a piano has an audible frequency of 262 Hz.

The age of the pulsar may be estimated as P/ 2 = 235 million years, an order of magnitude older than previously discovered pulsars.32 Although PSR 1937+214 is an isolated pulsar, the paradox of the oldest pulsar also being among the fastest quickly brought astronomers to a surprising conclusion: PSR 1937+214 must once have been a member of a low-mass X-ray  binary system. (Like PSR 1937+214, LMXBs have weak magnetic Ô¨Åelds.) AccretionÀôP
Those with high-mass companions (neutron stars) have shorter periods and eccentric orbits and probably result from the evolution of a massive X-ray binary system. (An

MXRB that managed to retain more than half of its mass following the supernova of thecompanion star would produce such a pair of neutron stars with elongated orbits.) The otherclass of binary pulsars are characterized by low-mass companions (white dwarfs), longerorbital periods, and circular orbits. These are probably the descendants of low-mass X-raybinary systems.Because LMXBs are common in globular clusters, radio astronomers slued their tele-scopes toward these targets and discovered more binary and millisecond pulsars (those withperiods less than approximately 10 ms). Numerous surveys, including one conducted by theChandra X-Ray Observatory, suggest that 47 Tuc may have more than 300 neutron stars, ap-proximately 25 of which are millisecond pulsars. The mounting statistics make it clear thatmost of the globular cluster pulsars are members of binaries and that most (but not all) aremillisecond pulsars. (Conversely, most of the known millisecond pulsars have been foundin globular clusters.) If these pulsars are the evolutionary product of LMXBs, then how canthe absence of a white dwarf companion be explained for a signiÔ¨Åcant minority of them?Black Widow PulsarsAn answer may be found from observations of PSR 1957+20. It is a rarity: a binary mil-lisecond pulsar that eclipses its companion, a meager 0.025 M‚äôwhite dwarf. However, theThe pulsar seems to beevaporatingits white dwarf companion with its energetic beam ofphotons and charged particles. Within a few million years, the white dwarf may disappear,devoured by thisblack widow pulsar; see Fig. 28.

eclipses last for some 10% of the orbit, implying that the light is blocked by an object larger than the Sun. SigniÔ¨Åcantly, the dispersion of the pulsar signal increases just be-fore and after the eclipse, indicating that the white dwarf is surrounded by ionized gas.

<<<PAGE 776>>>

Another example of the ablation of an eclipsing millisecond pulsar‚Äôs companion hasbeen found for PSR 1744‚àí24A in the globular cluster Terzan 5, where the eclipses last forhalf of the orbital period. It is possible that some of the evaporated material may form adisk of gas and dust around the pulsar that could eventually (after a million years or so)condense and form planets around the pulsar. Or, if the evaporation of the companion staris incomplete, a planet-size remnant could be left orbiting the pulsar.Mechanisms such as these may be responsible for the three planets thought to be travelingin circular orbits around PSR 1257+12, some 500 pc away in the constellation Virgo. Asdetermined from a careful analysis of pulse arrival times, the innermost planet has a mass of0.015 M‚äïthat is 0.19 AU from the pulsar, followed by a 3.4 M‚äïobject that is at a distanceof 0.36 AU. The outermost planet‚Äôs mass is 2.8 M‚äï, and it is at a distance of 0.47 AU.As more millisecond pulsars are discovered, it should become clear whether the foregoingevolutionary picture is correct.Double Neutron Star BinariesA small number of detached binary systems are known to exist in which both both membersare neutron stars. As highly relativistic systems with no current mass exchange between thesystem members, thesedouble neutron star binariesare exquisite natural laboratories forthe testing of predictions of the General Theory of Relativity.The Ô¨Årst such system discovered is theHulse‚ÄìTaylor pulsar, PSR 1913+16, with anorbital separation just a little larger than the Sun‚Äôs diameter. A 30-year study of this systemhas conÔ¨Årmed the existence of gravitational waves.3Nearly everything is known about the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor system with incredible precision,as can be seen by inspecting the observational data in Table 1.

As the separation ofthe neutron stars shrinks by about 3 mm per orbit, the system will coalesce some 300 millionyears in the future.Another tremendous natural laboratory for testing general relativity was discovered in2003. This double neutron star system is actually a binary pulsar system. J0737‚Äì3039A hasa pulse period ofPA=0.02269937855615¬±6√ó10‚àí14s, and J0737‚Äì3039B has a pulseperiod ofPB=2.7734607474¬±4√ó10‚àí10s. As with the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor pulsar, this (thusfar) unique system provides a valuable test of orbital precession and gravitational radiation.However, J0737‚Äì3039A/B can also test the prediction of delayed arrival times for signalsfrom one pulsar passing through the gravitational well of the other pulsar.As their signals interact with each other‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld and with the plasma environment,they provide an opportunity to test theories about plasma physics as well. It may also bepossible to measure the moments of inertia of the pulsars, providing important tests of theinterior structure models of neutron stars, including their exotic equations of state.Short‚ÄìHard Gamma Ray Burstsray bursts(<2 s) are the result of the mergers of compact objects, either two neutron starsor a neutron star and a black hole.The Ô¨Årst clear detections of mergers of compact objects in binaries were obtained bythe Swift and HETE-2 spacecraft in 2005. The July 9, 2005, event in particular also pro-duced a visible-light afterglow that allowed astronomers to unambiguously identify the hostgalaxy. Short‚Äìhard gamma ray bursts emit about 1000 times less energy than the long‚Äìsoftevents do.Close Binary Star Systems
What will be the consequence of the merger of the two neutron stars?  Extensive observations have conÔ¨Årmed that long‚Äìsoft gamma ray bursts  (> 2 s) are extreme examples of core-collapse supernovae (collapsars or su-pranovas). On the other hand, it is now believed that short‚Äìhard gamma

1 A BRIEF SURVEY
in some detail, namely our own. We will also consider the growing body of information
regarding extrasolar planets. However, it is beyond the scope of this text to describe all
of the fascinating details of each of the planets in our Solar System and their moons, not
to mention the meteorites, asteroids, comets, .uiper Belt objects, and interplanetary dust
that is left to the many excellent books dedicated to the subject. Rather, we will consider
the basic features of these objects and extrasolar planets in the context of stellar evolution,
together with some of the underlying physical processes that have helped to shape them.
General Characteristics of the Planets
The planets have long been studied from Earth, Ô¨Årstwith the naked eye and later with
telescopes. Since the advent of space Ô¨Çight, we have sent manned and unmanned spacecraft
to our Moon, and, with the exception of Pluto, we have visited (with unmanned probes)
each of the other planets in the Solar System.
Each of the planets (excluding Pluto, 2003 8B313,1and other members of the .uiper
belt) can be thought of as belonging to one of two major groups. The rocky terrestrial
12003 8B313 was discovered in January 200, based on images obtained in 2003. As of May 2006, an
ofÔ¨Åcial classi Ô¨Åcation of 2003 8B313 as a major planet or a minor planet had not yet been made, nor has
a formal name been given to the object. These of Ô¨Åcial designations are made by the International Astronomical
8nion.Based on the observations of protostars and very young stars (e.g., HH 30, 
Vega, Œ≤ Pictoris, and the proplyds in the Orion Nebula), it is evident that a natu-
ral extension of the formation of many stars includes the accompanying forma-
tion of planetary systems that develop within equatorial disks of material that 
 orbit the newborn stars. In fact the Ô¨Årst conÔ¨Årmation of an extrasolar planet 
around a main-sequence star (1 Pegasi) was announced in 199. After that initial 
 announcement, a total of 1 extrasolar planets were discovered in just the next 
ten years alone. We will now study one well-known example of a planetary system

The distances between objects are not to scale.(or Earth-like) planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and thegiantplanets(sometimes calledJovian, or Jupiter-like) include Jupiter, Saturn, 8ranus, and Neptune.The giant planets are also further separated into the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and theice giants (8ranus and Neptune). The two major groups have a number of very strikingdifferences, as can be seen by looking through Table 1. The relative si]es of the planetsand the Sun are illustrated in Fig. 1.Many of the differences noted in Table 1 are directly related to the distances of theplanets from the Sun and their corresponding temperatures. In fact, as we shall see, thistemperature effect profoundlyinÔ¨Çuencedthe evolution of the terrestrial and giant planetsby determining the extent of ice formation in the early solar nebula.Moons of the PlanetsThe number of moons orbiting each planet also variessigniÔ¨Åcantlybetween the terrestrialsand the giants.

However, three of the fourGalilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Ganymede, and Callisto)3and the giant satellite of Saturn(Titan) are physically larger and more massive. In addition, both Ganymede and Titanhave radii that are slightly larger than the planet Mercury‚Äôs even though their masses aresomewhat lower.In some respects, many of the characteristics of the giant moons of the Solar System aresimilar to those of the terrestrial planets, including active volcanoes on Io and the existenceof an atmosphere on Titan. Some of the moons have features unlike anything seen on theplanets, however, including the bi]arre topography on the surface of Miranda (one of themany moons of 8ranus).The Asteroid BeltIn 1766, before the discoveries of 8ranus, Neptune, and Pluto, Johann Titius (1729‚Äì1796)uncovered a simple mathematical sequence representing the orbital distances of the planetsfrom the Sun. The sequence was populari]ed several years later by Johann Elert Bode (1747‚Äì1826) and is now known as theTitius‚ÄìBode rule, or simplyBode‚Äô s rule(see Table 2).When Bode‚Äôs rule was proposed, it was reali]ed that the rule ¬≥predicted¬¥ the existenceof an object at a distance of 2.8 A8, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It was after adeliberate search that an Italian monk, Giuseppe Pia]]i (1746‚Äì1826), discovered theÔ¨ÅrstTABLE 2Predictions of the Titius‚ÄìBode Rule.

asteroidat approximately that location on January 1, 1801, and named it Ceres, for thepatron goddess of Sicily. Today many thousands of asteroids are known, although Ceresis the largest, containing some 30 of the entire mass of the group and having a diameterAlthough Bode‚Äôs rule agrees reasonably well with the orbits of most of the planets, andit did lead to the ¬≥prediction¬¥ of Ceres, it fails miserably for objects beyond 8ranus. It iswidely believed today that Bode‚Äôs rule is not based on any fundamental physical processand is only a mathematical coincidence. Historically, Bode‚Äôs rule has often been referredto as Bode‚Äôslaw, even though astronomers generally believe today that it is not associatedwith any basic ¬≥law of nature.¬¥ It is interesting to note, however, that a variation of Bode‚Äôsrule also works for some of the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and 8ranus.While many of the larger moons were certainly formed with their parent planet, othersare little more than large rocks that may have been caught in the planet‚Äôs gravitationalÔ¨Åeldas they wandered by. Many of these rocks are probably captured asteroids.The Comets and Kuiper Belt ObjectsAnother important class of objects that orbit our Sun are thecomets. Once thought to beatmospheric phenomena, and even harbingers of doom, comets are now known to be dirtysnowballs of ices and dust. Their spectacular, long tails are simply the escaped dust and gasof the evaporating ball of ice, being driven away from the Sun by radiation pressure andthe solar wind. Some comets, like the famous Halley‚Äôs comet, have relatively short orbitalperiods of less than 200 years, whereas the long-period comets can take over one millionyears to orbit the Sun.From their orbital characteristics, it seems very likely that the present-day source of theshort-period comets is theKuiper belt, a collection of icy objects located predominantlynear the plane of the ecliptic and beyond the orbit of Neptune, typically ranging from 30 A8to perhaps 1000A8 or more from the Sun. It is now reali]ed that Pluto and its moon Charon,2003 8B313, Sedna, and 4uaoar are among the largest known members of the family ofKuiper belt objects(.BOs), also referred to asTrans-Neptunian Objects(TNOs). Thelong-period comets apparently originate in theOort cloud, an approximately sphericallysymmetric cloud of cometary nuclei with orbital radii of between 3000 and 100,000 A8.Having spent most of their existence in ¬≥deep free]e¬¥ at the outer reaches of the SolarSystem, comets and .uiper belt objects appear to be ancient remnants of its formation,although perhaps not entirely unaffected by nearly 4.6 billion years of exposure to theenvironment of space.MeteoritesWhen asteroids collide with one another, they can produce small fragments known asmeteoroids. If a meteoroid should happen to enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, the heat generatedPhysical Processes in the Solar Systemof roughly 1000 km. Even though there are important exceptions, most asteroids orbit the Sun near the ecliptic plane at distances between 2 and 3. A8, a region referred to as the asteroid belt.

by friction results in a glowing streak across the sky, referred to as ameteor. If the rocksurvives the trip through the atmosphere and strikes the surface, the remnant is known as ameteorite. By analy]ing the composition of meteorites, we can learn a great deal about theenvironment in which they originated.Another source of meteoritic material is the slow disintegration of comets exposed tothe heat of the inner Solar System. When Earth encounters the debris left in a comet‚Äôsorbit, the result is ameteor showerof micrometeorites raining down through the planet‚Äôsatmosphere.Finally, the dust remaining in orbit about the Sun due to the disintegration of asteroidsand comets produces a faint glow fromreÔ¨Çectedsunlight. 8nfortunately, even the lights ofa small town are sufÔ¨Åcientto obscure thiszodiacal light.Solar System Formation: A Brief OverviewAll of these features of the Solar System can be understood in terms of its initial formationand subsequent evolution. Our present understanding of Solar System evolution is based onthe hypothesis that as the Sun was forming from the gravitational collapse of the originalsolar nebula, the decreasing radius of the cloud resulted in an increasing rate of spin and theaccompanying formation of a disk of material. Within thisaccretion diskthe temperaturevaried with distance from the protosun in such a way that rocks were able to consolidatethroughout the disk while ices (primarily water) were able to develop only at distancesbeyond the outer part of the present-day asteroid belt. As a result, the terrestrial planetsaccreted from collisions of small preplanetary chunks of material, known asplanetesimals,that were composed exclusively of rock, while the much larger giantsbeneÔ¨Åtedfrom theadditional presence of ices in the planetesimals.The higher temperatures in the inner portionsof the disk and the lower masses of the terrestrials also inhibited the capture of lightergases around those planets, while the cooler, more massive giants were able to accumulatesigniÔ¨Åcantand, in the cases of Jupiter and Saturn, very massive primordial atmospheres.Around the newly formed giant planets, smaller local accretion disks were forming someof the moons seen today. Other moons appeared when planetesimals and fragmented aster-oids were captured while wandering through the Solar System. In a different mechanism,it appears that our own Moon was produced when a relatively large planetesimal approxi-mately the si]e of the present-day Mars collided with the young Earth.After the formation ofthe planets and their moons, the ¬≥rain¬¥ of remnant material led to heavy cratering. Althoughthe rate of crater formation has decreasedsigniÔ¨Åcantlysince the time of the early SolarSystem, the process remains ongoing. Evidence of that violent beginning is still readilyapparent on many worlds today.Most of the icy objects that were drifting among the giant worlds without directly collid-ing with or being captured by one of the giant planets had their orbits dramatically alteredthrough gravitational interactions. Some of the cometary nuclei passing near 8ranus orNeptune were catapulted into much larger orbits, characteristic of the present-day Oortcloud, while those that ventured near Jupiter or Saturn were ejected from the Solar Systementirely. Other planetesimals that passed near the giant planets were sent inward to collidewith the terrestrial planets or the Sun. The icy bodies that formed beyond the orbit of Nep-tune remain in that region today, constituting the .uiper belt. Closer to the Sun, just insidePhysical Processes in the Solar System

the region of ice formation, rocky remnants of the Solar System‚Äôs formation still reside inthe asteroid belt.As a direct consequence of tidal and viscous interactions with the accretion disk, alongwith the scattering of planetesimals, Jupiter migrated closer to the Sun than where it initiallybegan forming, whereas Saturn, 8ranus, and particularly Neptune migrated farther fromthe Sun.As the discussion of this section indicates,signiÔ¨Åcantprogress has been made in un-derstanding the makeup and evolution of our local part of the universe.Solar System, togetherwith many of the physical processes that have shaped them.2TIDAL FORCESside of a moon is closer to its parent planet than is the opposite side, the planet‚Äôs gravitationalforce on a small test mass must be greatest on the moon‚Äôs near side. This has the effect ofelongating the instantaneous shape of the moon. According to Newton‚Äôs third law, the samesituation must also apply to the near and far sides of the planet because of the gravitationalinÔ¨Çuenceof its moon. Thisdifferentialforce on an object due to its non-]ero si]e is knownas atidal force. The resulting nonspherical shapes of the planet and its moon can actuallyinÔ¨Çuencetheir rotation rates by creating torques. If this tidal force is sufÔ¨Åcientlygreat, it iseven possible that the smaller world could be disrupted.The existence of tides on Earth‚Äôs surface is well known, particularly for those wholive near an ocean. There are two high tides approximately every 24 hours, 3 minutes,depending on local coastal features. Less well known are the tidal bulges of the solid Earth,which measure only about 10 cm in height. Since Earth issigniÔ¨Åcantlymore massive thanthe Moon (approximately 81 times), the bulges on the Moon are much larger, resulting innearly 20 m of deformation at its surface.The Physics of TidesTo better understand how tides arise on Earth, consider the force on a test massm1locatedwithin the planet at a distancerfrom the Moon‚Äôs center of mass,Fm=GMm1r2,whereMis the mass of the Moon (see Fig. 2). Now consider a second massm2=m1=m, located at a distancedrfromm1along a line connecting Earth and the Moon.

The actual gravitationalforce vectors due to the Moon are directed toward the center of mass of the Moon, but thedifferentialforce vectors act to compress Earth in they-direction and elongate it along theline between their centers of mass, producing tidal bulges. It is the symmetry of the bulgesthat produces two high tides in a 2-hour period as Earth rotates under an orbiting Moon.The Effects of TidesIn reality, Earth‚Äôs tidal bulges are not directly aligned with the Moon. This is because therotation period of Earth is shorter than the Moon‚Äôs orbital period and frictional forces onthe surface of the planet drag the bulge axis ahead of the Earth‚ÄìMoon line. Because frictionis a dissipative force, rotational kinetic energy is constantly being lost and Earth‚Äôs spin rateis continually decreasing. At the present time, Earth‚Äôs rotation period is lengthening at therate of 0.0016 s century‚àí1, which, although slow, is measurable.Physical Processes in the Solar System

BAEarthMoonFIGURE 5Earth‚Äôs bulge A is closer to the Moon than is bulge B, resulting in a net torque onthe planet. Note that the diagram is not to scale.The Moon is also known to be drifting away from Earth by 3 to 4 cm yr‚àí1. The increasingEarth‚ÄìMoon distance is determined by bouncing laser beams off the mirrors left on the Moonby the Apollo astronauts in the early 1970s and measuring the round-trip light-travel time.To see how the decrease in Earth‚Äôs rotation rate and the increase in the Earth‚ÄìMoondistance are related, we need only consider the torque exerted on Earth by the Moon‚Äôsinteraction with Earth‚Äôs tidal bulges. In Fig. , bulge A leads the Moon and is closer to itthan is bulge B. As a result, the force exerted on bulge A by the Moon is greater, resulting ina net torque that is slowing Earth‚Äôs rotation. At the same time, bulge A is pulling the Moonforward, causing the satellite to move farther out. This complementary behavior is just aconsequence of the conservation of angular momentum. Neglecting the dynamicalinÔ¨Çuenceof the Sun and the other planets on the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, no external torques exist toalter its total angular momentum. If Earth‚Äôs rotational angular momentum is decreasing, theorbital angular momentum of the Moon must necessarily increase.Because of tidal effects, given sufÔ¨Åcienttime Earth will slow its rotation enough thatthe same side of the planet will always face the Moon, just as the Moon now keeps thesame ¬≥face¬¥ toward Earth. In the distant future, if inhabitants on Earth‚Äôs far side want totake romantic moonlight walks, they will need to take vacations halfway around the world.Calculations indicate that this will happen when the length of the day is about 47 currentdays long.Synchronous RotationIn the past the Moon was much closer to Earth than it is today, perhaps taking as little as oneweek to orbit the planet. It is also probable that the Moon‚Äôs rotation period was once shorterthan its orbital period. The Moon‚Äôs present1-to-1 synchronous rotationis due to the sametidal dissipation that is occurring on Earth today. Its rotational period became synchroni]edwith its orbital period more rapidly than Earth‚Äôs has, simply because it is much smaller andbecause Earth produces much larger tidal deformations on the Moon than does the Moonon Earth.Synchronous rotation is common throughout the Solar System. The two moons of Mars,the four Galilean moons of Jupiter (along with Amalthea, a small moon inside Io‚Äôs orbit),Some binary star systems are also known to be in synchronous rotation.44Physical Processes in the Solar System

and most of the moons of Saturn are in synchronous rotation, as are many of the othermoons associated with the outer planets. In addition, Pluto and its largest moon, Charon,have reached theÔ¨Ånalstage of tidal evolution they are in mutual synchronous rotation,with the same side of Pluto constantly turned toward the same face of Charon.An interesting and unusual case of tidal evolution is that of Triton, the giant moon ofNeptune. Triton is in synchronous rotation and orbits the planet in a retrograde fashion. Inthis instance, the tidal bulges in Neptune actually work to cause that moon to spiraltowardthe planet rather than away from it. Apparently it will take billions of years before anycatastrophic interaction occurs. On the other hand, Phobos (one of the Martian moons) isin a prograde orbit, but with an orbital period of 7h39mthat isshorterthan the rotationperiod of Mars (24h37m). This means that Phobos is inside the planet‚Äôssynchronous orbit,deÔ¨Ånedto be where the planet‚Äôs rotation period and the satellite‚Äôs orbital period are equal.Consequently, it is ¬≥outrunning¬¥ the tidal bulge axis, and the resulting forces are causingthe moon to spiral inward. Phobos‚Äôs orbit is decaying rapidly enough that if it were to stayintact, it would hit the planet in about 0 million years. The other Martian moon, 'eimos,is outside the synchronous orbital radius and is spiraling outward, just as our Moon is.Additional Tidal Effects from the SunOf course, the Earth‚ÄìMoon system is not in strict isolation. For instance, the Sun alsoproduces tidal forces that act on Earth. When the Sun, Earth, and the Moon are all aligned(at full Moon or new Moon), the differential forces due to the Sun and the Moon add tocreate unusually large tidal bulges on Earth, calledspring tides. AtÔ¨Årstquarter or thirdquarter, the Sun, Earth, and Moon form a right angle. In thisconÔ¨Ågurationthe tides producedby the Sun and the Moon tend to cancel, and unusually lowneap tidesresult.The Roche LimitIt is unlikely that Phobos will actually remain intact long enough to strike the planet.Recall that the differential tidal force is proportional tor‚àí3 as a moon gets closer to itsparent planet, tidal effects become more severe. This means that the shape of a moon insynchronous rotation becomes increasingly elongated. Neglecting any internal cohesionforces (i.e., assuming an ideali]edÔ¨Çuidobject), when the orbital distance has decreasedsufÔ¨Åciently, it becomes no longer possible todeÔ¨Ånea shape for the moon such that theforce of gravity is perpendicular to the surface at every point. As a result, the surface willcontinuallyÔ¨Çowin the direction of the net gravitational force vector. Oscillations will thendevelop in the extended structure, and the moon will come apart. The maximum orbitalradius for which tidal disruption occurs is known as theRoche limit, named for EdouardRoche (1820‚Äì1883), whoÔ¨Årstcarried out the analysis in 180. In his study Roche took intoconsideration orbital and rotational motion, and he assumed aÔ¨Çuid,prolate spheroid (i.e.,a football-shaped moon).To make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the orbital radius at which a moon willbreak apart, assume (incorrectly) that this happens when the differential force exceeds theEarth‚Äôs synchronous orbit is sometimes referred to as geosynchronous orbit.ArtiÔ¨Åcialsatellites placed in geosyn-chronous equatorial orbits remainÔ¨Åxedover the same geographic point on the surface. Communications satellitesare generally placed in such orbits.

In his more careful analysis, Roche found a largervalue for the leading constant offR=2.46. The fact that our result gave too small a valuefor the radiusreÔ¨Çectsthe incorrect assumption that it is the differential force exceeding self-gravity that is ultimately responsible for the disintegration of the satellite. Since oscillationsin the body will develop at greater radii, self-gravity is stillsigniÔ¨Åcantlygreater than thedifferential term at the true Roche limit. (Although not considered in this analysis, self-cohesion of an object that is provided by the electromagnetic force, such as molecularbonds or the formation of a crystal lattice, can also decrease the point at which an objectwill be disrupted.)Example 2.1.The average density of Saturn is 687 kg m‚àí3and its planetary radius is6.03√ó107m. 8sing a value offR=2.46, the Roche limit for a moon having an averagedensity of 1200 kg m‚àí3is 1.23√ó108m. Much of the ring system of Saturn lies within thisorbital radius given by the Roche limit, and all of Saturn‚Äôs large moons are farther out. Thematerial within ring systems may be the result of disintegrating or tidally disrupted moonsthat wandered within the Roche limit.3THE PHYSICS OF ATMOSPHERESOur Solar System today is the result of billions of years of ongoing evolution caused by ahost of physical processes. Subtle differences in initial conditions of neighboring planetshave led to the very different worlds we see today.

For simplicity, we will assume that the planet‚Äôs temperature is uniform over its surfaceand that the planetreÔ¨Çectsa fractionaof the incoming sunlight (ais known as the planet‚Äôsalbedo). From the condition of thermal equilibrium, the sunlight that is notreÔ¨Çectedmustbe absorbed by the planet and subsequently re-emitted as blackbody radiation. Of course,we will also treat the Sun as a spherical blackbody having an effective temperatureT‚äô=Teand radiusR‚äô.

The Chemical Evolution of Planetary AtmospheresThe evolution of a planetary atmosphere is a complex process that depends on the localtemperature of the solar nebula during the time of the planet‚Äôs formation, together with theplanet‚Äôs temperature, gravity, and local chemistry following the formation process. In thecase of the terrestrial planets, outgassing from rocks and volcanos also played a role afterthe development of the initial, primordial atmosphere. On Earth, the development of lifehas also contributedsigniÔ¨Åcantlyto the evolution of its atmosphere. Impacting comets andmeteorites affect planetary atmospheres as well.among gas particles become negligible, particles moving upward will travel only under theinÔ¨Çuenceof gravity, following trajectories described by simple projectile motion. Thoseatoms or molecules that are not moving rapidly enough to escape, or that do not have thecorrect trajectories, will fall back down into the denser layers and undergo collisions withthe gas. On the other hand, particles that are moving upward and have velocities that aresufÔ¨Åcientlygreat will be able to escape the gravitational pull of the planet altogether andmove out into interplanetary space. It is this process that can allow the atmospheres of someplanets (or at leastspeciÔ¨Åcchemical components of those atmospheres) to ¬≥leak off.¬¥ Theregion in an atmosphere where the mean free path of the particles becomes long enough forthem to travel without appreciable collisions is referred to as theexosphere.Because of the high-velocity tail of the Maxwell‚ÄìBolt]mann distribution, and because ofthe amount of time that has elapsed since the Solar System formed, if a particular componentof the atmosphere is going to escape, it is not necessary that the root-mean-square averagevelocity of those particles be greater than the escape speed. It is only necessary that asufÔ¨Åcientlylarge number of particles have speeds greater thanvesc.

temperature is somewhat higher (274 .). In reality, the vertical temperature structure ofEarth‚Äôs atmosphere is very complex and depends on its hydrodynamic motions togetherwith the ability of various atoms and molecules to absorb radiation. Near the top of theatmosphere, the temperature is also strongly dependent on the amount of solar activity.Within the exosphere the characteristic temperature is about 1000 ..Consider Earth‚Äôs ability and the Moon‚Äôs inability to retain molecular nitrogen.

Example 3.3.Equations ( 8) and ( 9) can be used to estimate the amount of timerequired for molecular nitrogen to escape from Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. A rough calculationof the total number of N2molecules in the atmosphere can be made by assuming that thenumber density decreases approximately exponentially with height, just as the pressuredoes if the atmosphere is nearly isothermal. Thenn(z)=n0e‚àíz/HPwheren0is the number density at the surface andHPis the pressure scale height.8sing the ideal gas law (Eq. 10.11) with the mass of the nitrogen molecule(MN2) beingused for¬µmH, the pressure scale height may be written asHP=PœÅg=kTgMN2.(10)Notice that the pressure scale height is different for particles of different masses. 8singcharacteristic values at Earth‚Äôs surface (T=288 . andg=9.80 m s‚àí2),HP=8.7 km formolecular nitrogen.Making the rough assumption that the pressure scale height remains constant with alti-tude, and neglecting the slight change inrrelative to Earth‚Äôs surface, the number densitycan now be integrated over the volume of the atmosphere, givingN=4œÄR2‚äïn0HP.Taking the number density of nitrogen molecules near the surface to ben0=2√ó102m‚àí3,the total number of nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere isN=9√ó1043.From Eq. ( 9) and Fig. 6, the atmospheric escape parameter for nitrogen moleculesfrom Earth‚Äôs exosphere isŒΩ=4√ó10‚àí88ms‚àí1. Also, at the height of the exosphere (ap-proximately 00 km), the mean number density of N2is 2√ó1011m‚àí3. 8sing Eq. ( 8),weÔ¨Åndthat the rate at which nitrogen molecules are escaping Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is ap-proximatelyÀôN=4√ó10‚àí62s‚àí1. 'ividing the total number of available molecules by therate of loss, the time required to dissipate the nitrogen in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is estimatedto betN2=NÀôN=2√ó1010s=6√ó1097yr.It is safe to say that Earth‚Äôs atmospheric nitrogen is not going to escape any time soonThe situation is very different for atomic hydrogen in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, however.Earth‚Äôs atmosphere actually differs appreciably from an isothermal approximation. As a result, the estimate ofn(z)used here would need to bemodiÔ¨Åed signiÔ¨Åcantlyin a more careful analysis. Nevertheless, this ¬≥back-of-the-envelope¬¥ calculation illustrates many of the basic physical principles involved and yields the correct generalconclusion.8

Besides the loss of high-velocity particles from the exponential tail of the Maxwell‚ÄìBolt]mann distribution, other factors also contribute to the dissipation of an atmosphere.Molecularphotodissociation, caused by the absorption of 8V photons in the upper atmo-sphere, breaks down some molecules into atoms or lighter molecules, with the result thatH2+Œ≥‚ÜíH+H.Gravitational Separation of Atmospheric ConstituentsAnother feature of atmospheric physics that can affect the loss of certain components isthegravitational separation(also known aschemical differentiation) of constituents ofan atmosphere by weight. In the absence of the continual mixing caused by convection atlower altitudes, composition differences develop with height in the upper atmosphere. Thiseffect can be understood by referring to the expression for the pressure scale height in theform of Eq. ( 10). For a given temperature, the pressure scale height increases as themass decreases, meaning that the number densities of lighter particles do not diminish asrapidly withz. As a result, lighter particles become relatively more abundant in the upperatmosphere, enhancing the likelihood of their escape.Circulation Patternsregions at high latitudes, where it sinks back down again. The cycle closes when the gasreturns to the warmer regions near the equator. If the warm air were able to migrate all theway from the equator to the poles before sinking, the global pattern illustrated in Fig. 7(a)would occur. This hypothetical circulation pattern is known asHadley circulation.In reality, the warmer air at higher altitudes is undergoing radiative cooling as it migratestoward the poles. At about 30‚ó¶N and S latitude, the air has given up enough heat that itsinks and returns to the equator, where it is reheated again. Similarly, the colder air thatis migrating from the poles toward the equator at lower altitudes heats and rises at about‚ó¶N and S latitude, returning to the poles where it sinks again. This breaks up the globalHadley circulation pattern into three ]onal components, as shown in Fig. 7(b).These general ]onal weather patterns are further complicated by the planet‚Äôs rotation.Since a rotating body does not constitute an inertial reference frame, pseudo-forces, suchas theCoriolis force, are present.Assume for simplicity that Earth is perfectly spherical. At a latitudeL, a point on thesurface is located a distancerLfrom the rotation axis, given byrL=R‚äïcosL.Letting the angular rotation speed of Earth beœâ, the eastward speed of the surface at thePhysical Processes in the Solar System
As is the case with stars, convection in planetary atmospheres is driven largely by steep temperature gradients. Near the equator, where the intensity of the sunlight is great-est, the atmosphere heats up and the warm gas rises. The gas then migrates to coolerthe individual particles have greater speeds. For instance,   The solar wind can also contribute to the loss of particles through collisions in the upper atmosphere, causing direct ejection, or molecular dissociation and subsequent escape. Even heating caused by impacting meteorites and comets can accelerate the loss of atmospheric con-stituents.

However,at a latitude ofL=40‚ó¶, the speed is reduced to 1300 km s‚àí1. As a result, according to anobserver in an inertial reference frame, a person standing still on the surface of Earth atthe equator is moving approximately 370 km h‚àí1faster than someone standing still on thesurface at a latitude of 40‚ó¶. This velocity difference with latitude affects weather circulationpatterns.As an illustration of the effect of the Coriolis force, consider the apparent motion of aprojectileÔ¨Årednearly hori]ontally from the equator northward, as shown in Fig. 8(a).Also assume that the elevation of the projectile above the surface of Earth is essentiallyconstant during itsÔ¨Çight.From the point of view of an observer on Earth‚Äôs surface located atthe origin of the projectile‚Äôs motion, the projectileinitially appearsto be traveling straightnorth since the observer has the same easterly speed as the easterly component of theprojectile‚Äôs velocity vector at the time of launch. However, from the point of view of anobserver in an inertial reference frame far above the planet, the direction of the projectile‚Äôsmotion will be northeast precisely because it has an eastward component to its velocityvector.As the projectile travels north, it will appear to an observer on the ground that the path willdeÔ¨Çecttoward the east due to some undetected ¬≥force¬¥ >Fig. 8(b)@. However, the observerin an inertial frame understands this observation as being due to the velocity difference ofEarth‚Äôs surface with latitude the easterly component of the projectile‚Äôs velocity vector willcause it to ¬≥outrun¬¥ observers at progressively more northerly latitudes on Earth.It can be shown that the value of the Coriolis force as measured in a noninertial referenceframeÔ¨Åxedto the surface of Earth is given byFC=‚àí2mœâ√óv,(11)Physical Processes in the Solar System

The Coriolis force is also responsible for themotions of clouds around high- and low-pressure systems.The Complexities of Weather SystemsAs anyone who has watched weather forecasts knows, weather circulation patterns onEarth are much more complex than has been described above. Effects such as moisturein the atmosphere, the diversity of land forms, the transport of heat by ocean currents,temperature differences between oceans and land, and even frictional effects between theatmosphere and the surface of the planet all contribute to the complexity of Earth‚Äôs weathersystems.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralBeatty, J. .elly, Petersen, Carolyn Collins, and Chaikin, Andrew (eds.),The New SolarSystem, Fourth Edition, Cambridge 8niversity Press and Sky Publishing Corporation,Cambridge, MA, 1999.Physical Processes in the Solar System

The 3-to-2 Spin‚ÄìOrbit Coupling of Mercury
The Ô¨Årst hint that Mercury‚Äôs orbit also exhibits another curious feature came in 1965 when
Rolf B. Dyce and Gordon H. Pettengill successfully bounced radar signals off the planet
using the Arecibo radio telescope. The reÔ¨Çected signals had a spread of wavelengths that
revealed Mercury‚Äôs rotation speed; because of the Doppler effect, radio waves that hit the
approaching limb were blueshifted and those that struck the receding limb were redshifted.
These observations indicated that Mercury‚Äôs rotation period was approximately 59 days.
More precise measurements made by the Mariner 10 spacecraft during its repeated Ô¨Çybys
of the planet in 1974 and 1975 showed that the rotation period was actually 58.6462 days,
exactly two-thirds the length of its sidereal orbital period of 87.95 days.

planets also share many of those same characteristics. In this chapter we shall focus 
our attention on the terrestrial planets and their moons.
The innermost planet, Mercury (Fig.  1), orbits so close to the Sun (0.39 AU) that 
 Kepler‚Äôs laws begin to break down. The reason is that spacetime in the vicinity of 
massive objects is affected in such a way that Newton‚Äôs familiar inversesquare law is 
no longer a completely adequate description of gravity. It was the slow advance of the 
perihelion point of Mercury‚Äôs rather eccentric orbit ( e = 0.2056) that presented one of 
the Ô¨Årst tests of Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity.

As a result, due to the tremendous energy dissipation from friction that accompaniestidal distortions, Mercury‚Äôs spin slowed to the point where the alignment ultimately didoccur at perihelion during each orbit; see Fig. 2.The Surface of the PlanetPictures returned by Mariner 10 revealed a planet that bears a strong superÔ¨Åcial resemblanceto the Moon (compare Figs. 1 and 6). Mercury is a world that is heavily cratered,indicating that it underwent extensive bombardment during its nearly 4.6-billion-year his-tory. Such evidence of violent collisions is commonplace on many worlds, giving us a hintof the Solar System‚Äôs history. One impact (at what is now known as Caloris Basin) was solarge that it created ripples that traveled across the planet and converged on the oppositeside to produce a jumbled collection of hills.A careful comparison of images of the Moon and Mercury shows that Mercury‚Äôs cratersare often separated by regions that are largely devoid of signiÔ¨Åcant cratering.

The atoms that leave the regolith mayhave been liberated by impacting solar wind particles or the vaporization of regolith materialby micrometeorites.Ironically, radar data suggest that this closest planet to the Sun possesses highly reÔ¨Çec-tive volatile material, probably water ice, in permanently shadowed craters near the polarcaps.1Because tidal interactions have forced the planet‚Äôs rotation axis to be almost exactlyperpendicular to its orbital plane, the polar regions never get more than a very small amountof sunlight. Moreover, with virtually no atmosphere to speak of, Mercury cannot efÔ¨Åcientlytransport heat away from the equatorial regions. As a result, temperatures near the polesprobably never exceed 167 K, and in shadows within craters near the poles, temperatures1The NASA 70-m tracking station at Goldstone, California, was used to send the nearly 500-kW signal at awavelength of 3.5 cm, and the VLA received the reÔ¨Çected beam.The Terrestrial Planets

may be as low as 60 K. These temperatures are low enough that any water ice that mayhave been deposited there by a process such as cometary collisions would sublimate onlyover very long time scales.The InteriorMercury‚Äôs relatively high average density (5427 kg m‚àí3), when compared to that of theMoon (3350 kg m‚àí3), indicates that it must have lost most of its lighter elements andundergone enough gravitational separation to create a fairly dense core. Based on computersimulations Ô¨Årst performed in 1987 by Willy Benz, Wayne Slattery, and Alastair G. W.Cameron (1925‚Äì2005), it appears that Mercury may have experienced a major collision witha large planetesimal early in its history. The collision was sufÔ¨Åciently energetic that muchof the outer, lighter silicate material was removed, leaving behind the iron and nickel thathad previously settled to the center of the planet. As a result, after the collision the planet‚Äôsaverage density was substantially increased. Estimates place the mass of the impactor atabout one-Ô¨Åfth Mercury‚Äôs current mass, and the speed of the impact at perhaps 20 km s‚àí1.Prior to the collision, Mercury‚Äôs mass may have been twice its present value. Although thismay seem to be an ad hoc explanation for Mercury‚Äôs unusual density, we will soon learnthat the early Solar System was a violent place and that massive collisions were simply apart of its evolution.Mercury‚Äôs Weak Magnetic FieldMercury‚Äôs rotation, together with its large conducting metallic core, may be responsible forits magnetic Ô¨Åeld. The maximum strength measured by Mariner 10 was about 4√ó10‚àí7Tat an altitude of 330 km, about 100 times weaker than the magnetic Ô¨Åeld measured nearis that aliquid metallicconducting core replaces the ionized gas in stars as the source of theÔ¨Åeld. To date, the details of planetary dynamos are not well understood. In Mercury‚Äôs case,the fact that the rotation is so slow seems to contradict the idea that a magnetic dynamois currently in operation. Furthermore, the relatively small size of the planet suggests thatits core should have cooled to the point that any molten core would be too insigniÔ¨Åcant togenerate a measurable Ô¨Åeld. As a result, opponents of a present-day dynamo mechanismsuggest that Mercury‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld may be a ‚Äúfrozen-in‚Äù remnant of its past, when theplanet may have been rotating faster and when it was warmer.2VENUSVenus, the second planet from the Sun, is sometimes referred to as Earth‚Äôs sister planetbecause its mass (0.815 M‚äï) and radius (0.9488 R‚äï) are comparable to Earth‚Äôs. Despitethese basic similarities, the two planets are markedly different in many of their fundamentalfeatures.The Terrestrial Planets

Retrograde RotationIn the 1960s, one of the many unusual features of Venus was discovered. Astronomerslearned that the atmospheric circulation was retrograde (the direction opposite its orbitalmotion), with speeds near 100 m s‚àí1at the cloud tops close to the equator; see Fig. 3(a).This inference was based initially on observations of the clouds in its atmosphere; it wasconÔ¨Årmed later by measurements of the Doppler shift of spectral lines from sunlight reÔ¨Çectedoff the clouds. Later, Earth-based radar Doppler measurements of the surface (like thosemade of Mercury) revealed that the planet itself also rotates retrograde, but 60 times moreslowly than its upper atmosphere. The sidereal rotation period of Venus is a very sluggish243 days; this compares to its orbital period of 224.7 days.The retrograde rotation of the planet is an interesting puzzle. All of the planets in theSolar System orbit prograde, as do most of their moons. This means that these worlds orbitin a counterclockwise direction as seen from a vantage point above Earth‚Äôs north pole.Furthermore, with the exceptions of Venus, Uranus, and Pluto, all of the other planets andmost of their moons also rotate prograde, just as the Sun does. This agrees with what onewould expect from the development of the Solar System out of a spinning disk of materialthat formed when the Sun did.Based on detailed analytical and numerical studies of the interactions among Venus, theSun, and the other planets in the Solar System, Alexandre Correia and Jacques Laskar wereable to show that Venus‚Äôs retrograde rotation can be explained in terms of gravitationalperturbations. The many perturbations acting on Venus from the other bodies in the Solar

System lead to a chaotic zone in the tilt of the axis between 0‚ó¶and 90‚ó¶. As gravitationalperturbations cause Venus to pass through that zone, the tilt of its rotation axis can varydramatically. Within the Ô¨Årst several million years following the planet‚Äôs formation, its verythick atmosphere develops and also starts to inÔ¨Çuence the outcome of the planet‚Äôs rotation.This occurs because the thick atmosphere can be signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by tidal forces, andthe thick atmosphere can also produce a damping effect. Numerical simulations based onvarious initial conditions for the rotation period and tilt of Venus‚Äôs axis most often led to thevery slow, retrograde rotation of Venus that is observed today. However, the path to this Ô¨Ånalstate could be through either the Ô¨Çipping of the rotation axis to near 180‚ó¶or the slowing ofthe spin rate to zero at an axis tilt of 0‚ó¶, and then tides producing a slow retrograde rotation.the cloud cover circles the planet in just four days, producing the ‚ÄúY‚Äù-shaped cloud patternsevident in Fig. 3(a). Such high-speed motions are common in high-altitude jet streams(narrow rivers of air) but are unusual for the bulk of the atmosphere, particularly with suchslow underlying rotation.The Lack of a Magnetic FieldOne consequence of the planet‚Äôs slow rotation that does agree with expectation is the lack ofany measurable magnetic Ô¨Åeld. The currents within a molten, conducting core are generatedby planetary rotation; therefore, one crucial component of the magnetic dynamo mechanismis absent in Venus. Because there is no magnetic Ô¨Åeld to protect the planet via the Lorentzforce,supersonicionsinthesolarwinddirectlystriketheupperatmosphere,causing collisional ionization and a standing shock wave at the location where the solarwind particles are abruptly slowed to subsonic speeds.The Hot, Thick Atmosphere of VenusAnalysis of the composition of the dense atmosphere, made Ô¨Årst by ground-based telescopesand later by Soviet andAmerican probes, revealed that its chief constituent is carbon dioxide(CO2), which makes up about 96.5% of the total number of atoms or molecules, withmolecular nitrogen (N2) making up most of the remainder (3.5%). Traces of other moleculesare also present, most notably argon (70 ppm),2sulfur dioxide (SO2, 60 ppm) carbonmonoxide (CO, 50 ppm), and water (H2O, 50 ppm). The probes even detected thick cloudsof concentrated sulfuric acid. At the base of the atmosphere the temperature is 740 K,sufÔ¨Åcient to melt lead, and the pressure is 90 atm, equal to the pressure at a depth of over800 m below the surface of Earth‚Äôs oceans.3The very high surface temperature far exceeds what is expected from a simple blackbodyanalysis,suchastheoneperformedinExample3.1.Itisthelargeamountofcarbon2ppm represents parts per million.31 atm=1.013√ó105Nm‚àí2.The Terrestrial Planets
The dynamical behavior of Venus‚Äôs atmosphere is also a puzzle. Probes that entered the atmosphere measured the presence of two large Hadley cells, one in each hemisphere, consistent with the planet‚Äôs slow rotation rate and the cor-responding lack of any signiÔ¨Åcant Coriolis force.

dioxide (a greenhouse gas) in the atmosphere that is responsible for the extreme conditionsat the surface. The atmosphere is so thick that the optical depth at infrared wavelengthsis approximatelyœÑ=70, meaning that the temperature is increased over the blackbodytemperature that would be predicted for anairlessplanet at the location of Venus by a factorof nearly(1+œÑ)(1/4)=2.9.How could Earth‚Äôs sister planet have developed an atmosphere so different from ourown? The formation of terrestrial atmospheres is still not well understood and is an area ofactive research. However, based on the direct evidence we have of outgassing from Earth‚Äôsvolcanoes and the discovery of volcanoes on both Venus and Mars, it seems likely that atleast a portion of a terrestrial planet‚Äôs atmosphere may arise from volcanic activity. It hasalso been suggested that signiÔ¨Åcant fractions of the atmospheres of these planets may havebeen delivered by comets and meteorites. If the later suggestion is true, then understandingthe atmospheric evolution of the terrestrial worlds requires a greater understanding of thecomposition of comets and meteorites, as well as the frequency with which they collidewith the worlds of the inner Solar System.Whatever the source of Venus‚Äôs primordial atmosphere, carbon dioxide is the dominantconstituent today, and very little water is present. Conversely, water is abundant in Earth‚Äôsoceans, but there is very little atmospheric carbon dioxide. What happened to change therelative abundances of those molecules on the two planets? If the two worlds began withsimilar compositions, as seems likely, given that they formed near one another in the solarnebula and have comparable sizes, then water was probably much more abundant on Venusin the past. In fact, since the luminosity of the zero-age main sequence Sun was only about0.677 L‚äô,muchlessthanitistoday,Venusmayhaveevenhadhotwateroceans on its surface early in its history.As the Sun‚Äôs luminosity increased and the planet wasbombarded by planetesimals, the surface temperature began to rise and the oceans started toevaporate. The addition of more infrared-absorbing water vapor in the atmosphere triggeredarunaway greenhouse effect, causing the surface temperature to climb to near 1800 K, hotenough to vaporize the remainder of the water and even melt rock. At the same time, theatmospheric pressure at the surface reached 300 atm. Since H2O is lighter than CO2, thewater migrated to the top of the atmosphere where it was dissociated by solar ultravioletradiation through the reaction H2O+Œ≥‚ÜíH+OH. This UV photodissociation processliberated the lighter hydrogen atoms, allowing most of them to escape from the planet. Sincethe carbon dioxide remained, it became the dominant species in the atmosphere of Venus.As is true of any viable scientiÔ¨Åc theory, it is important that the theory make testablepredictions. In the evolutionary scenario for the atmosphere of Venus just described, thephotodissociation of water should have left behind altered isotope ratios of hydrogen. Hy-drogen has two stable isotopes,11H (or simply hydrogen, H) and21H (deuterium, D), whichare chemically identical but differ in mass by a factor of two. On Earth the ratio of thenumbers of deuterium atoms to hydrogen atoms is D/H=1.57√ó10‚àí4. However, withinthe atmosphere of Venus the ratio is closer to D/H=0.016. The factor-of-100 increasein the atmospheric D/H ratio for Venus relative to Earth is due to the more massive iso-tope‚Äôs slower rate of escape.Apparently our understanding ofthe runaway greenhouse effect on Venus is essentially correct.The Terrestrial Planets

Studying the SurfaceBecause of the thick cloud cover and inhospitable climate, it has been a difÔ¨Åcult job gatheringinformation about the surface of Venus. The SovietVeneramissions in the late 1960sthrough early 1980s were able to descend into the atmosphere of the planet and in somecases land on the surface, operating for short periods of time before succumbing to theenvironment found there. While on the surface, they returned pictures of their immediatevicinity. The landers also sampled the composition of the atmosphere and surroundingrock, conÔ¨Årming the presence of sulfur in the atmosphere and Ô¨Ånding rock of volcanicorigin on the surface. Variations in sulfur dioxide content over timescales of decades and thedetection of radio bursts characteristic of lightning in the atmosphere support the suggestionof recent volcanic activity. In particular, observations by various spacecraft and ground-based telescopes indicate that the sulfur dioxide content in the atmosphere of Venus hasdecreased by more than an order of magnitude, with some intermittent Ô¨Çuctuations since thelate 1970s. Since ultraviolet radiation converts SO2to sulfuric acid in the upper atmosphere,the observed decrease in the sulfur dioxide concentration has led some scientists to suggestthat a major eruption may have occurred sometime during the 1970s, with a smaller eventoccuring around 1992.By far the greatest amount of information about the surface of Venus has come fromradar imaging, because radio signals can easily penetrate the atmosphere even though vis-ible and ultraviolet light cannot. Radar studies have been carried out using Earth-basedtelescopes such as Arecibo, and from orbiters, including the Venera andPioneerseries,and most recently from theMagellanspacecraft. Launched from the Space ShuttleAtlantisin 1989, Magellan‚Äôs very successful mission lasted until 1994, when it was intentionallysent diving into the atmosphere to gather information about the density structure of theplanet‚Äôs atmosphere. During Magellan‚Äôs operational lifetime, it mapped 98% of the surfaceat resolutions of between 75 m and 120 m. A Magellan mosaic of one hemisphere of Venusis shown in Fig. 3(b).During roughly one-half of its mission, Magellan sent back a continuous radio signalto Earth so that scientists could monitor the variation in the signal‚Äôs wavelength caused bythe Doppler effect. As Magellan passed over regions of higher average density, the localgravitational pull would speed up the spacecraft slightly and the wavelength of the signalreceived at Earth would change. In this way, Magellan was used to generate a detailedgravity map of the planet, covering approximately 95% of its surface.4By combining images of a given region made from two different locations, together withgravity information, scientists have been able to produce detailed three-dimensional imagesof much of the planet‚Äôs surface. Figure 4 shows Maat Mons, a volcano 8 km high located0.9 degrees north of the equator. In this image the vertical relief has been exaggerated bya factor of 22.5 to bring out important features. Based on changes in surface reÔ¨Çectivity,variations in rock characteristics become evident. Apparent in the image of Maat Mons arelava Ô¨Çows that extend for hundreds of kilometers from the volcano. Estimates place the ageof the surface rock around Maat Mons at less than 10 million years, and it may be muchyounger.4To increase the resolution of the gravity data, Ô¨Çight controllers lowered Magellan‚Äôs orbit using the previouslyuntried technique of aerobraking; Magellan dipped down into the atmosphere slightly, causing the spacecraft tolose orbital energy via atmospheric drag.The Terrestrial Planets

FIGURE 4Maat Mons is believed to be the tallest volcano on Venus, measuring 8 km in height.The vertical scale has been increased over the horizontal scale by a factor of 22.5. (Courtesy ofNASA/JPL.)It appears that the entire surface of the planet may have been refreshed relatively recentlycompared to the age of the Solar System. This estimate comes from the number of impactcraters found on the surface (e.g., see Fig. 5). If we assume that Venus has been struck byimpacts at about the same rate as other worlds in the inner Solar System (such as Mercury orour Moon), then from the relatively low number of craters found on the surface of Venus wecan conclude that large-scale lava Ô¨Çows must have occurred about 500 million years ago.5In support of this conclusion, nearly one thousand volcanic features have been identiÔ¨Åedon the surface of the planet.3EARTHThe planet for which we have the greatest amount of information by far is of course ourEarth (see Fig. 6). We have studied its atmosphere, its oceans, and its active geology witha great deal of speciÔ¨Åcity. We have been able to carefully investigate its extensive biology,from the smallest microbes to the largest plants and animals, and to study the evolutionaryprocesses that have led to our planet‚Äôs great biodiversity. We have also been able to extendour knowledge by developing follow-up experiments based on information gained fromprevious studies. This makes investigating our own planet signiÔ¨Åcantly more robust andinteractive than investigating other bodies in our Solar System to date.65Absolute age estimates of the Moon will be discussed in detail in Section 4.6However, as we will see when we discuss Mars in Section 5, humans have begun to conduct extensive roboticstudies of that planet based directly on information returned from previous and ongoing missions.The Terrestrial Planets

The present-day atmosphere of Earth is made up of (by number) 78% N2, 21% O2,1% H2O, and traces of Ar, CO2, and other constituents. The atmosphere owes its currentcomposition in part to the development of life on the planet. For instance, plants processcarbon dioxide into oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.The Greenhouse Effect and Global WarmingSerious concern now exists over the effects of artiÔ¨Åcially introducing carbon dioxide andother greenhouse gases into Earth‚Äôs atmosphere by industrial means. To complicate matters,we are simultaneously destroying vast regions of vegetation, such as theAmazon rain forests,that could recycle CO2. The commonly used technique of slash-and-burn clearing of therain forests also releases tremendous quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.To illustrate the problem, recent changes in the abundance of carbon dioxide over MaunaLoa, Hawaii, are shown in Fig. 7; the oscillations are due to the annual growing season.

However, it is also important to know that the Sun was signiÔ¨Åcantly less luminous in the early Solar System than it is today. This implies that Earth‚Äôs surface would have been cooler in the past and its water should have been in the form of ice, even as recently as 2 billion years ago. However, geologic evidence, including fossil records, suggests that Earth‚Äôs oceans were liquid as early as 3.8 billion years ago. This puzzle has become known as the faint ancient Sun paradox. The resolution of this paradox probably lies in details of the greenhouse effect and a different atmospheric composition than exists at the present time.

The deviations are measured from a 25-year average between 1951 and 1975. (Datafrom K.M. Lugina, P.Ya. Groisman, K.Ya. Vinnikov, V.V. Koknaeva, and N.A. Speranskaya, 2004.In Trends Online: A Compendium of Data on Global Change.Carbon Dioxide Information AnalysisCenter, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, U.S.A.)Because of the nonlinear behavior of the greenhouse effect and the very complicated physics,chemistry, and meteorology that are involved, accurate computer models are only slowlybecoming available. However, despite current limitations in the predictive power of thesemodels, the basic effects of greenhouse gases are understood. As we have learned fromVenus, increasing the content of greenhouse gases in an atmosphere will raise its averagetemperature. The questions are by how much the temperature will increase, and how rapidlyit will occur.Figure 8 shows the average temperature deviations in the Northern Hemisphere ofEarth between 1881 and 2003 with respect to a 25-yr average of temperatures computedfrom 1951 through 1975. Evident is a consistently upward trend in the average temperaturesince about 1970. Whether this upward trend is the start of a long-term steady increase ora fairly short-term Ô¨Çuctuation has been a matter of some debate. However, it is clear thata signiÔ¨Åcant upward trend is currently under way; in fact, seven of the ten hottest years inthe twentieth century occurred in the 1990s.Associated with the effects ofglobal warmingis evidence that Earth‚Äôs glaciers arereceding world wide. In addition, the Arctic ice cap has thinned signiÔ¨Åcantly since 1970and Earth‚Äôs ocean levels have risen. Also supporting the conclusion that human-drivenglobal warming is occurring is the increase in the average ocean surface temperature byapproximately 0.5‚ó¶C since the late 1960s, with warming extending down to depths ofseveral hundred meters. Since the oceans eventually absorb some 84% of the excess heatin the atmosphere, the observation of this temperature increase is signiÔ¨Åcant. The oceantemperature increase also agrees with computer modeling of global climate changes thatinclude the inÔ¨Çuence of increased greenhouse gas emissions.The Terrestrial Planets

Another environmental concern about human activity is the release of chloroÔ¨Çuorocar-bons into the atmosphere. These molecules migrate into the upper atmosphere above theNorth and South Poles, where they are destroying the ozone (O3). Ozone is known to be amajor absorber of ultraviolet radiation, and as such, it plays an important role in protectinglife on Earth‚Äôs surface.Much more research is necessary before we can hope to understand the magnitude of theenvironmental consequences of human behavior. Unfortunately, by the time more detailedpredictions are available, it may not be possible to reverse the trend.In recognition of the importance of global warming to the inhabitants of our planet, theÔ¨Årst-ever ‚ÄúEarth Summit‚Äù was held in 1992, involving most of the nations of the world.OfÔ¨Åcially known as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development,its purpose was to discuss global environmental concerns. The treaty that came from thatsummit is the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Then, in December 1997, morethan 160 nations met in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate binding limitations on greenhouse gasesfor the developed nations. After much debate and compromise, resolutions regarding suchthings as the emissions of greenhouse gases were Ô¨Ånally agreed on. The Kyoto Protocolcame into force on February 16, 2005, after being ratiÔ¨Åed by 157 countries. However,the United States, the world‚Äôs largest producer of greenhouse gases at the time the KyotoProtocol went into effect, did not ratify the agreement, citing concerns over its impact onthe nation‚Äôs economy.Seismology and Earth‚Äôs InteriorThe structure of Earth‚Äôs interior can be derived by analyzing the seismic waves generated byearthquakes. Two principal types of waves are produced by earthquakes:P waves(pressureorprimary) are longitudinal waves capable of traveling through both liquids and solids, andS waves(shear orsecondary) are transverse waves that are restricted to traveling throughsolids only (see Fig. 9). Since the velocities and paths of both P and S waves dependon the medium through which they are moving, their detection around the world enablesgeologists to deduce the structure of our planet.7For instance, in regions where only Pwavesare measured, the absence of S waves implies that there must have been intervening liquidin the path of the wave (see Fig. 10). Furthermore, because of the refraction that occursat boundary interfaces (much like the refraction of light rays at the boundaries betweenmedia of differing indices of refraction),shadow zonesexist where neither type of wavecan be detected. Thus, using the data from P and S waves, geologists can map the interiorof the planet. Such maps yield information about the depth of the surfacecrustand revealthe existence of a solidinner core, a moltenouter core, and a thickmantle.The behavior of P waves in the outer core implies that its composition is predomi-nantly iron and nickel. This also agrees with the fact that the average density of Earth is5515 kg m‚àí3, greater than the density of surface rocks (typically 3000 kg m‚àí3) and water(1000 kg m‚àí3).8It is the combination of high temperature (>4000 K) and compositionthat results in aliquid outer core. The transition back to asolid inner coreoccurs becauseof the extreme pressures found there.7An analogous procedure is used to study the interiors of many stars.8Gravitational compression also contributes to the higher value for the average density, relative to surface material.The Terrestrial Planets

Earth‚Äôssurface layer, known as thelithosphere, encompasses both the oceanic and continental crustas well as the outer portion of the mantle. The lithosphere is fractured intocrustal platesThe Terrestrial Planets

CrustMantleOutercoreInnercoreLithosphereAsthenosphere
FIGURE 11The interior structure of Earth is composed of an inner solid core, an outer liquidcore, a mantle, and surface crust. The crust and the outer portion of the mantle make up the lithosphere(containing the surface plates) and the underlying convective asthenosphere. The diagram is not toscale.(see Fig. 12) and rides on the convective, somewhat plasticasthenosphere, which isalso part of the mantle. As the plates move across the surface of the planet, they crash intoor grind against one another, carrying the continents with them.9Because of these motions,the Atlantic Ocean is widening at the rate of approximately 3 cm yr‚àí1, spreading away froman underwater mountain range that runs the length of the ocean Ô¨Çoor. This mid-Atlanticridge is the location where material from the interior rises to the surface, generating newsea Ô¨Çoor as the continents separate (see Fig. 13).Extrapolating the motions of the plates backward in time, geologists believe that therewas once one giant supercontinent, known as Pangaea, that broke apart some 200 millionyears ago into two smaller supercontinents, Laurasia and Gondwanaland. Gondwanaland inturn separated into South America and Africa, and Laurasia divided into Eurasia and NorthAmerica.Earth‚Äôs plate boundaries are generally the sites of active volcanism, mountain building,and frequent earthquakes. For example, when two plates collide, the lighter continentalcrust overrides the heavier oceanic crust and asubduction zonedevelops, as illustrated inFig. 13. One such location is along the coast of Japan, where its volcanic islands werecreated as a result of the heat generated by friction as the oceanic crust descended into theinterior of Earth. It is at the location of these subduction zones that deep oceanic trenchesalso develop. If two plates collide that contain continental crust, neither plate will overrunthe other; instead, buckling occurs and a mountain range such as the Himalayas is generated.9For example, the PaciÔ¨Åc and North American plates are currently sliding past one another. The famous SanAndreas fault is located on the boundary between these two plates.The Terrestrial Planets

The existence of Earth‚Äôsmagnetic Ô¨Åeld serves to protect the planet from incoming charged particles in the solar wind,as well as other ionized cosmic rays. Instead of striking the surface, these particles becometrapped in the dipole Ô¨Åeld and bounce back and forth between the North and South poles(Fig. 14). Three regions of trapped particles have been identiÔ¨Åed and are known as theVan Allen radiation belts. The innermost belt is composed of protons and is at a height ofroughly 4000 km above Earth‚Äôs surface. Overlapping a portion of the inner belt is a secondbelt composed of atomic nuclei that were once part of the interstellar medium. The outermostbelt is composed of electrons at an altitude of approximately 16,000 km. Particles in thebelts that are energetic enough to enter Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere near the poles strike atomsand molecules there, causing collisional excitation, ionization, and dissociation. When theatoms or molecules recombine, or when the electrons drop back down to lower energylevels, the subsequent emission of light is observed as theaurora borealis(northern lights)andaurora australis(southern lights); see Fig. 15.Interestingly, geologic evidence indicates that Earth‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld weakens, reversespolarity, and reestablishes itself on an irregular time scale of some 105years. This can beseen in the orientation of magnetic minerals trapped in molten rock that later solidiÔ¨Åed,

His argumentwas based on the amount of gravitational potential energy the planet could release and the rate at which heat escapedover time. However, his calculation was made before the discovery of radioactivity.The Terrestrial Planets

In this way, a ‚Äúfossil record‚Äù of the direction of the local magnetic Ô¨Åeld is created.The behavior of Earth‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld is not unlike the solar cycle, the Ô¨Çipping of the Sun‚Äôs magneticÔ¨Åeld roughly every 11 years.Earth‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld is known to be weakeningtoday.4THE MOONDespite the proximity of the Moon to Earth, the two worlds are very different (see Fig. 16).Because of its low surface gravity, the Moon has been unable to retain a signiÔ¨Åcant atmo-sphere. Without a protective atmosphere, the Moon has suffered impacts by meteoritesthroughout its history. Along with a large number of smaller impacts, a signiÔ¨Åcant numberof very large collisions occurred approximately 700 million years after the Moon formed.These impacts were powerful enough to penetrate its thin crust, allowing molten rock inthe interior to Ô¨Çow across the surface. The result was the formation of the many smooth,roughly circularmaria(or ‚Äúseas‚Äù) that can be seen on the surface of the Moon facing Earth.It is the distribution of these maria that has led humans to imagine seeing the face of the‚Äúman in the Moon.‚ÄùThe Moon‚Äôs Internal StructureMajor advances in our understanding of the Moon‚Äôs internal structure and evolutionaryhistory have occurred as a result of intense exploration from 1959 through the early 1970s.When theApolloastronauts landed on the Moon, they left seismic detectors designed tomeasure anymoonquakesthat may be occurring. Many of the very weak quakes that weredetected (about magnitude 1 on the Richter scale) were triggered by the tidal strain generatedby Earth‚Äôs gravitational pull. Another class of vibrations has been attributed to the Moon‚ÄôsThe Terrestrial Planets

Just as with the analysis of seismic activityon Earth, moonquakes have allowed scientists to develop an understanding of the Moon‚Äôsinterior.Many of the moonquakes appear to have originated, not at tectonic plate boundaries,but at the interface between the solid, brittle lithosphere and the plastic asthenosphere (seeFig. 17). It also appears likely that below the asthenosphere, a small iron-rich core existsas well. This structure is consistent with measurements of the small amount of heat stillÔ¨Çowing outward from the Moon‚Äôs interior, which is responsible for maintaining the plasticThe Terrestrial Planets

nature of the asthenosphere. However, based on the data provided by this seismic activity,Earth-like tectonic activity appears to be absent on the Moon today.Interestingly, only one mare was seen on the side of the Moon farthest from Earth.11This is not because collisions were preferentially occurring on the side of the Moon facingEarth; rather, the crust is actually thinner on the near side. Consequently, impacts on thethin-crust side were more likely to penetrate the crust, allowing interior molten rock to Ô¨Çowover the surface. Because the crust is less dense than material in the Moon‚Äôs interior, tidalforces have caused the heavier near side to permanently ‚Äúhang down‚Äù toward Earth.The Absence of a Global Magnetic FieldUnlike Earth, our Moon has no measurable global magnetic Ô¨Åeld, apparently because theMoon is small enough to have cooled off much more rapidly than Earth. This evolutionhas left the Moon as a geologically inactive world today. Furthermore, the Moon‚Äôs rotationperiod is more than 27 times longer than Earth‚Äôs. As a result, there is no evidence of anysigniÔ¨Åcant magnetic dynamo in operation, suggesting that if a molten core is present, it islikely to be quite small.12are comparable in mass and radius (the Moon‚Äôs mass and radius are 23% and 71% of thevalues for Mercury, respectively), while Mercury‚Äôs rotation rate is slower by a factor oftwo. Clearly, much work remains to be done in understanding the details of magnetic Ô¨Åeldproduction.Moon RocksDuring the 1960s and 1970s, six manned United States Apollo missions returned 382 kgof surface rocks and regolith from the Moon‚Äôs surface. In addition, three unmanned SovietUnionLunamissions returned an addition 0.3 kg of material. The samples were collectedfrom both the maria and thehighland(or mountainous) regions between the maria. Thesesamples represent the most detailed information we have about the nature of our closestneighbor.Composition analysis of samples returned from the maria conÔ¨Årm that they are in factvolcanic in origin. The rocks arebasalts, similar to the kind of volcanic rock found on Earth.The lunar basalts are rich in iron and magnesium, and they also contain glassy structures thatare characteristic of rapid cooling. However, unlike Earth basalts, the lunar samples containno water and a lower percentage ofvolatiles(elements or compounds with low melting andboiling temperatures) relative torefractories(higher melting and boiling temperatures).Radioactive DatingPerhaps the most eagerly awaited results of the analysis of the lunar samples were thedeterminations of their ages. The process is based on measuring the abundances of certain11The Ô¨Årst observations of the far side of the Moon were made by the Soviet Luna 3 mission in 1959.12Based on the natural remnant magnetization of returned lunar samples and the patchy magnetization detectedby satellites, it appears that the Moon once had a global magnetic Ô¨Åeld. However, there is no evidence of a globalÔ¨Åeld today.The Terrestrial Planets
The lack of a global magnetic Ô¨Åeld on the Moon makes the detec-tion of a weak Ô¨Åeld around Mercury even more puzzling. The two worlds

In this technique ofradioactive dating, we assume that the ‚Äúclock‚Äùstarted ticking when the rock solidiÔ¨Åed, trapping the isotopes inside.If the half-life of one step in the decay sequence is signiÔ¨Åcantly longer than any of theothers, it can be assumed that the original isotope decays directly into the Ô¨Ånal productwith a half-life approximately equal to that of the longest one.

Asa result, to a good approximation, the half-life of the entire sequence can be taken to be7.04√ó108years. This means that by measuring the relative abundances of the uranium andlead isotopes, we can determine the time required for the transformation.Some radioactive isotopes that are useful for dating Moon rocks, as well as Earth rocksand meteorites, are given in Table 1.

This is because8638Sr and8738Sr are chemicallyidentical, allowing them to be bound up in minerals in the same proportions, whereas theproportion of8737Rb/8638Sr need not be constant throughout.from the Sea of Tranquility by theApollo 11astronauts in 1969, the ages of the maria(typically 3.1 to 3.8√ó109years) are signiÔ¨Åcantly less than those of the highlands. This isconsistent with the observation, noted earlier, that relatively few craters can be found in themaria compared to the highland regions.In sharp contrast, the oldest rocks ever found on Earth date to 3.8 billion years, whereas90% of the planet‚Äôs crust is younger than 600 million years. Plate tectonic activity is con-stantly recycling the surface, carrying old crust down into the mantle and forming new crustto replace it.

Late Heavy BombardmentIt is the dating of lunar samples that implies that a spike oflate heavy bombardment(LHB) occurred roughly 700 million years after the Moon formed. It was during that timethat the majority of the cratering occurred in the lunar highlands. During the LHB phase,a small number of very large collisions produced the maria. Over the last 3.8 billion yearsmeteorite impacts have continued, but at a signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced rate. In this way the fairlysmooth, relatively uncratered surfaces of the maria have been maintained.The ‚Äútime stamp‚Äù provided by Moon rocks not only plays an important role in ourunderstanding of the evolution of the Moon but is also crucial in developing a picture ofevolution for other planets, as well as an overall formation theory for the Solar System.Forinstance,therecognitionofanLHBepisodefollowedbymeteoriteimpacts at roughly a constant rate has helped scientists to conclude that the surface of Venuswas refreshed within approximately the last 500 million years. This scenario also suggeststhat the surface of Mercury is, in general, quite ancient.The Formation of the MoonThe question of the Moon‚Äôs formation has been widely debated. Prior to theApollo and Lunamissions, several models had been proposed. TheÔ¨Åssion model(also sometimes called thedaughter model), Ô¨Årst suggested in 1880 by George Darwin15(1845‚Äì1912), contendedthat the Moon was ‚Äútorn off‚Äù from Earth at a time when Earth was spinning more rapidlythan it is today. However, the orientation of the Moon‚Äôs orbital plane is close to the ecliptic(tilted 5.1‚ó¶), rather than along the plane of Earth‚Äôs equator as would be expected if theMoon broke away. Furthermore, the lack of any water in the lunar samples, together withthe underabundance of other volatiles relative to surface rock on Earth, also contradicts thisproposal.Theco-creation model(also known as thesister model) suggested that the Moon andEarth formed simultaneously, with the Moon coalescing from a small disk of material thatdeveloped around the proto-Earth. This idea also fails to explain the composition differencesfound in the lunar samples.Athird model, thecapture model, proposed that the Moon was actually formed elsewherein the solar nebula and was caught in Earth‚Äôs gravitational Ô¨Åeld as it drifted by. However,in this scenario the composition differences are not great enough; the Moon and Earth aretoo similar. For instance, the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen are nearly identical withinlunar and terrestrial samples despite signiÔ¨Åcant differences found in meteorites. Also, thedynamics of such a capture seem unlikely. Since the Moon is fairly large compared to Earth,a third, similarly sized body would need to have been present to take up much of the system‚Äôssurplus energy, as required for a capture. Having three large objects in close proximity atjust the right time seems highly improbable. On the other hand, capture seems to be alikely mechanism for some of the many small moons found throughout the Solar System.In these cases, energy may have been lost through a many-body interaction with othermoons already present. Alternatively, orbital energy may have been lost by aerobrakingif the captured moon passed through a portion of the planet‚Äôs atmosphere, much like the15George Darwin was the son of Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882), the author of the theory of Darwinian biologicalevolution.The Terrestrial Planets

maneuver performed with the Magellan spacecraft around Venus. However, our Moon ismuch too large for any of these mechanisms to work.In 1975 a fourth model, now known as thecollision model, was proposed by WilliamK. Hartmann and Don R. Davis. Since that time numerous computer simulations haveveriÔ¨Åed its plausibility (e.g., Fig. 20). This model seems to explain many of the problemsencountered by the three previous scenarios. The model suggests that a giant object, perhaps

twice the mass of the present-day Mars, collided with Earth almost 4.6 billion years ago,vaporizing much of the impactor and causing a portion of Earth‚Äôs surface to be ripped away.The pulverized material then formed a disk around Earth that coalesced over a relativelyshort period of time (estimates range from months to about 100 years). Due to the hightemperatures generated during the collision, many of the volatiles present in Earth‚Äôs crustwould have been absent in the condensing debris. Assuming that there had been sufÔ¨Åcienttime prior to the collision for some gravitational separation to occur within Earth and theimpactor, the crusts of the two objects would also have been somewhat deÔ¨Åcient in iron,leaving less iron available to form the Moon. The simulations suggest that most of thepresent-day Moon was produced by silicate-rich material from the mantle of the impactor,and that the impactor‚Äôs iron-rich core became a part of Earth. This model effectively explainswhy the Moon‚Äôs average density is comparable to the density of Earth‚Äôs uncompressedmantle (i.e., the density that would be measured if the compressional effect of gravity wereremoved). In this model the collision would have also preserved the similar oxygen-isotoperatios seen on the two worlds.The collision model is considered by most researchers as the preferred model for theformation of our Moon. Although it appears on Ô¨Årst inspection to be a highly unique andperhaps ad hoc way to explain the characteristics of our Moon, recall that a similar scenarioalso appears to explain the highly dense structure of Mercury. The existence ofPluto‚ÄôsmoonCharonmayrequirealarge-scalecollisionaswell.From our investigation of the Moon, it appears that its formation was a violent pro-cess. However, numerous questions about the Moon‚Äôs structure and evolution remain unan-swered. It is also apparent that careful studies of our nearest neighbor can shed light onimportant questions regarding the formation and evolution of Earth and the rest of the SolarSystem. Perhaps future missions to the Moon would further clarify our understanding ofthe Solar System.5MARSOnly one-tenth the mass of Earth, the planet Mars has touched our imagination. In 1877the astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli (1835‚Äì1910) reported seeing a series of darklines on the surface of the planet and referred to them ascanali(naturally occurring channelsof water). The term was later misinterpreted to imply that the markings were actually animmense network of artiÔ¨Åcialcanalsbuilt by an intelligent civilization to irrigate a dyingworld. In support of this argument is the existence of the seasonally varying polar ice caps,visible in the Hubble Space Telescope image shown in Fig. 21(a). It is not difÔ¨Åcult toimagine that using smaller telescopes, which were peering at the red planet through Earth‚Äôsobscuring atmosphere, would have led to the conclusion that canali were present. In an effortto verify these features, Percival Lowell (1855‚Äì1916) built an observatory near Flagstaff,Arizona, to carry out a series of careful observations of this nearby world. Other astronomerswere somewhat more skeptical of the existence of intelligent life on Mars, and even of thecanali. However, the general public seized on the possibility that Martians do (or at leastdid) live there, leading to a wealth of science Ô¨Åction literature and Ô¨Ålms.The Terrestrial Planets

Early efforts includedtheMarinerÔ¨Çyby missions in the 1960s. In 1975 theVikingmissions included two orbitersand partnered landers that contained cameras and internal laboratories for the study of Marssurface chemistry. Since the landers did not have any ability to move across the surface,their studies were restricted to the locations where they set down on the planet. TheMarsGlobal Surveyor, with its very high-resolution camera entered Mars orbit in 1997 andcontinues to operate successfully at the time of this writing, as does theMars Odyssey,which arrived in 2001, and theMars Express Orbiter, an ESA mission that reached thered planet in 2003. Another spacecraft, theMars Reconnaissance Orbiter, also began itswork around the planet in 2006.TheSojourner Roverof theMars PathÔ¨Åndermission (1997) was the Ô¨Årst truly mobilelander, able to move short distances across the surface in the vicinity of its lander, theCarlSagan Memorial Station.16Then in January 2004, two golf-cart-sized rovers successfullylanded on the surface and began extensive exploration of the regions around their landingareas. TheMars Exploration Rovers,SpiritandOpportunity, were originally expectedto operate for several months, but they continued to move across the surface of the planet aslate as May 2006. The Mars Orbiter has been able to image both rovers from its vantage pointin orbit around the planet. Other missions are also planned, including additional orbitersand landers and possible human-crewed missions to Mars.16The stationary lander base was renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station after landing in honor of Carl Sagan(1934‚Äì1996), Solar System researcher, Pulitzer-prize-winning author, and popularizer of astronomy.The Terrestrial Planets

Evidence of Water on MarsDespite the many studies of Mars from Earth, from Mars orbit, and from its surface, nosign of life has been found on the planet. At Ô¨Årst inspection, the images returned by Spiritand Opportunity (see Fig. 22), along with images obtained from the Viking landers, givethe impression of a dry, dusty world. However, on closer inspection of data returned bySpirit and Opportunity, along with information from the orbiters, research has revealed afascinating world that, although dry today, once clearly had water Ô¨Çowing across its surface.Apparent in images of the surface from the Mars Orbiter (see Fig. 23) are channels thatare characteristic of water erosion found on Earth. There is also evidence that huge Ô¨ÇashÔ¨Çoods may have occurred on the surface of the planet. It appears that lakes of water mayhave been present on Mars in the distant past as well (Fig. 24).With present-day surface temperatures varying between‚àí140‚ó¶C(‚àí220‚ó¶F) and 20‚ó¶C(70‚ó¶F), combined with the very low atmospheric pressure found near the surface (typically0.006 atm), it appears that the liquid water that was present on Mars is now either trappedin a layer of permafrost or frozen in its polar ice caps [Fig. 21(a)]. In fact, it is the lowatmospheric pressure that makes the existence of persistent water in liquid form impossibleon the surface today.ALH84001, A Martian MeteoriteIronically, even though the intense investigations of Mars by robotic spacecraft and landershave thus far failed to identify any evidence that life exists on Mars today or existed therein the past, a meteorite discovered in Allan Hills, Antarctica, in 1984 led to speculation that

Some scientists have argued that these structuresrepresent nanofossils of ancient microbial life on Mars. (Courtesy of NASA.)evidence existed in that rock from space [Fig. 25(a)].ALH84001is the oldest meteoriteever found that originated from the surface of Mars. After forming on Mars 4.5 billionyears ago, it was ejected from the surface of the planet 16 million years ago by an energeticcollision. After traveling through the inner Solar System, it struck Earth 13,000 years agoand became trapped in the Antarctic ice sheet.17ConÔ¨Årmation that the meteorite did indeedoriginate on Mars comes from comparing its chemical composition with the results ofcompositional studies conducted by robotic landers.It was the examination of small amounts of carbonate grains in the meteorite that has ledsome researchers to suggest that ancient, fossilized Martian microbes may be contained inthe rock [Fig. 25(b)]. The grains themselves measure less than 200¬µm in size, and whatappear to be fossilized microbes are smaller than 1/100 the size of a human hair. In supportof the hypothesis that the ‚Äúnanofossils‚Äù are due to ancient microbial life is the presence oforganic PAHs in the carbonate, along with oxide and sulÔ¨Åde biominerals. The carbonategrains also appear to have formed in fractures in the rock, possibly in the presence of liquidwater.Most researchers now believe that, although ALH84001 is a fascinating rock that clearlyoriginated on Mars, the evidence is weak that it contains samples of primitive fossilizedlife. Rather, it could be that the features formed by some inorganic mechanism(s) or thatthe rock became contaminated as a result of the 13,000 yr it spent on Earth before it wasdiscovered.The Polar CapsAlthough water ice is certainly present today in the polar caps, the caps are composedprimarily of dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide). Mars‚Äôs axis tilt of 25‚ó¶and its orbital periodof 1.88 yr means that the planet‚Äôs seasonal variations are similar to Earth‚Äôs but are roughlytwice as long. Consequently, Mars experiences winter and summer seasons correspondingto observed variations in the sizes of the ice caps. It is the dry ice that sublimates during the17The ejection and landing ages were determined through cosmic ray exposure that the meteoroid received priorto hitting Earth.The Terrestrial Planets

Martian summer and freezes back out again during the winter. The small residual cap thatremains during the summer is composed of water ice.Chaotic Fluctuations in Mars‚Äôs Rotation AxisFrom numerical simulations designed to investigate the long-term stability of planetarymotions, it appears that the orientation of Mars‚Äôs spin axis Ô¨Çuctuates wildly (chaotically)between about 0‚ó¶and 60‚ó¶over time scales as short as a few million years; the variations aredue to gravitational interactions with the Sun and the other planets. If Mars has experiencedsuch large Ô¨Çuctuations in its axis tilt in the past, this would imply that at various times thepolar ice caps could completely melt (high tilt angle), whereas at other times the planet‚Äôsatmosphere might actually freeze out (low tilt angle).The time-variability of the tilt of Mars‚Äôsspin axis also implies that its current tilt, which is similar to Earth‚Äôs, is only coincidental.Interestingly, these simulations of the Ô¨Çuctuations imply that the chaotic behavior doesnot develop if the effects of general relativity are neglected. It seems that the effects ofspacetimecurvatureplayanimportantroleinthelong-termbehaviorofplanetaryorbitsandtheirrotations,evenatthedistanceofMars‚Äôsorbit.Even though it is closer to the Sun, Earth has not experienced the same dramatic oscil-lations in its axis tilt that Mars seems to have gone through. Apparently Earth‚Äôs rotationaxis is stabilized by our planet‚Äôs strong tidal interaction with its relatively large moon. Con-sequently, our planet‚Äôs climatic variations have been much less pronounced than those onMars. Amazingly, this seems to imply that the presence of Earth‚Äôs moon (apparently theresult of an accidental collision) is in part responsible for the stable environment that led tothe evolution of life on the third planet from the Sun.The Thin Atmosphere of MarsMars‚Äôs very thin atmosphere is composed of 95% carbon dioxide and 2.7% molecularnitrogen, by number‚Äîpercentages very similar to those in the atmosphere of Venus. Unlikethe case of Venus, however, the greenhouse effect has very little inÔ¨Çuence on the currentequilibrium temperature of Mars; there simply are not enough molecules present to absorba signiÔ¨Åcant amount of infrared radiation (the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venusis 90 atm, 13,000 times greater than the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars). Inthe past, the atmosphere of Mars may have been much more dense, causing the greenhouseeffect to be more efÔ¨Åcient than it is today. The water that is currently trapped in the ice capsand permafrost would then have been Ô¨Çowing freely, maybe even resulting in rainfall. Thewater that was present in the atmosphere and on the surface would have absorbed muchof the atmospheric carbon dioxide, subsequently locking the CO2in carbonate rocks. Asa result, the greenhouse effect diminished, the global temperature dropped, and the waterfroze, leaving the dry world we Ô¨Ånd today.Shortly after the two Viking landers arrived at Mars in 1975, they began to measurean appreciable drop in atmospheric pressure. This was because winter was coming to theSouthern Hemisphere, and carbon dioxide was freezing out of the atmosphere. When springreturned to the south, the atmospheric pressure went back up again. The same behavior wasrepeated when winter arrived in the Northern Hemisphere.The Terrestrial Planets

Dust StormsEven though the atmospheric density is quite low near the surface, it is sufÔ¨Åcient to producehuge dust storms that sometimes cover the entire surface of Mars. The seasonal storms aredriven by high winds and are responsible for the variations in surface hues that can be seenfrom Earth.18It was during the Viking missions in 1976 that two such major dust storms occurred.Since that time, much of the dust has settled out of the planet‚Äôs atmosphere, resulting innoticeable changes in its climate. (The absorption of light by dust is the primary source ofatmospheric heating.) In fact, the Hubble Space Telescope recorded a decline in the averageglobal temperature of the planet. With the decrease in average temperature, ice-crystalclouds have become more prominent in the planet‚Äôs lower atmosphere than they were at thetime of the Viking missions.The Abundance of IronThe dust on the surface (recall Fig. 22) appears reddish in color and contains a rela-tively high abundance of iron, which oxidizes (rusts) when exposed to the atmosphere.Apparently Mars did not undergo the same degree of gravitational separation that Earthdid, possibly because the smaller, more distant planet cooled more rapidly following itsformation. However, averaging over the volume of the entire planet reveals that iron isactually underabundant on Mars relative to the other terrestrial planets, as evidenced by itslower average density of 3933 kg m‚àí3. The reason for this is not yet understood.The lack of signiÔ¨Åcant gravitational separation is also consistent with the absence of anappreciable global magnetic Ô¨Åeld. If an iron core is present, presumably it is quite smalland probably not molten.Evidence of Past Geological ActivityEven if Mars may not be geologically active today, it certainly has been in the past. Fig-ure 21(b) shows Valles Marineris, a 3000-km-long network of canyons near the planet‚Äôsequator. It appears that Valles Marineris, which is up to 600 km wide in some places andcan reach a depth of 8 km, was formed fromfaulting(or fracturing of the crust) in order torelieve stresses that built up in the interior.Olympus Mons, shown in Fig. 26, is a shield volcano that covers an area roughlythe size of Utah. The volcano rises 24 km above the surrounding surface and has a hugecaldera (a volcanic crater). Geologists believe that Olympus Mons owes its enormous sizeto a process known ashot-spot volcanism, where a weak spot in the crust has allowedmolten material to rise to the surface. It is hot-spot volcanism on Earth that is responsiblefor the creation of the Hawaiian islands.19However, in the case of the Hawaiian islandchain, motion of the tectonic plate on which the chain rides carries each newly formedvolcano away from the hot spot, allowing another one to be created. Today the chain of18These seasonal variations were once thought by some astronomers to be evidence of vegetation growing cycles.19The tallest mountain on Earth, measured from its base to its summit, is the Hawaiian Island of Mauna Loa, witha vertical rise above the sea Ô¨Çoor of 9.1 km.The Terrestrial Planets

Since Mars has apparentlynot developed a system of moving tectonic plates, the volcano was not carried off the hotspot where it formed. As a result, it has grown larger and larger as more molten materialhas made its way to the surface.21Two Tiny Moonsogy.

The Realms of the Giant Planets1The Giant Worlds2The Moons of the Giants3Planetary Ring Systems1THE GIANT WORLDSExcluding the Sun, by far the largest member of the Solar System isJupiter, 317.83times more massive than Earth. Jupiter and the other three giants,Saturn,Uranus, andNeptune, together contain 99.5% of the entire mass of the planetary system (see Fig. 1).Consequently, if we hope to understand the development and evolution of our Solar System,it is vital that we understand these distant worlds.The Discovery of the Galilean MoonsNaked-eye observations of Jupiter and Saturn began when human beings Ô¨Årst started gazingup at the heavens. But it was in 1610 that Galileo became the Ô¨Årst person to look at theseplanets through a telescope. In so doing, he detected the four large moons of Jupiter, nowcollectively known as theGalilean moons.1Galileo also saw Saturn‚Äôs rings, but becauseof his telescope‚Äôs low resolution, he thought that the rings were two large satellites situatedon either side of the planet.The Discoveries of Uranus and NeptuneIt wasn‚Äôt until 1781 that William Herschel (1738‚Äì1822), a German-born musician living inEngland, made the chance discovery of Uranus. By considering gravitational perturbationsaffecting the orbit of Uranus, John Couch Adams (1819‚Äì1892), a graduate student at Cam-bridge University, proposed in October 1845 that another planet must exist even farther fromthe Sun. Using Bode‚Äôs rule to guess at the distance of this unknown planet from the Sun,Adams predicted its position in the heavens. Unfortunately, when he submitted his work toSir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal of England, Airy did not believe the conclusions. InJune 1846, Urbain Leverrier (1811‚Äì1877), a very well-respected French scientist, indepen-dently made the same prediction, agreeing with Adams‚Äôs position to within 1‚ó¶. Learning ofthe agreement between the two predictions, Airy began to search for the object. However,1The four Galilean moons were also discovered independently by Simon Marius (1570‚Äì1624) in 1610.From Chapter 2  of An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicSecond Edition, Bradley W.

In a very real sense, Neptune was discovered in the mathematicalcalculations of Adams and Leverrier; Galle merely conÔ¨Årmed their work.Missions to the Giant PlanetsSince the Ô¨Årst observations of these worlds, the efforts of Earth-based astronomers haveprovided important information about the giant planets and their many satellites.

were thePioneer 10andPioneer 11Ô¨Çybys of Jupiter (1973, 1974) and the Pioneer 11Ô¨Çyby of Saturn (1979). Later,Voyager 1andVoyager 2embarked on their spectacularlysuccessful ‚ÄúGrand Tour‚Äù missions. Both V oyagers, launched from Earth in 1977, visitedJupiter (1979) and Saturn (1980, 1981), and V oyager 2 continued on to Uranus (1986) andNeptune (1989). In each case the encounters with the planets were brief Ô¨Çybys. Today thePioneer2and V oyager spacecraft are on their way out of the Solar System. The V oyagerspacecraft (renamed theVoyager Interstellar Missions) continue to send back informationover immense distances with ever-weakening signals, providing data about the outer reachesof the Solar System, including the interaction between the solar wind and the winds fromother stars. In early 2006, V oyager 1 was 8.7 billion miles (14 billion kilometers) from Earth,traveling at a speed of 3.6 AU per year, and V oyager 2 was 6.5 billion miles (10.4 billionkilometers) away, traveling at a speed of 3.3 AU per year. It is believed that V oyager 1passed the solar wind‚Äôs termination shock in December 2004, as evidenced by an increasein the strength of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld in the vicinity of the spacecraft by a factor of 2.5.The Hubble Space Telescope has also been used to observe the outer planets from Earthorbit. HST has documented signiÔ¨Åcant changes in the planets since the Ô¨Çyby missions ofthe 1970s and 1980s.An extended and detailed investigation of the Jovian system began in 1995 when theGal-ileospacecraft (launched in 1989) entered into orbit around Jupiter. In addition to observingthe planet carefully, Galileo completed numerous Ô¨Çybys of the Galilean moons during theeight years it spent in the Jovian system. As a part of the mission, a probe descended intothe planet‚Äôs atmosphere by parachute, sampling the atmosphere‚Äôs composition and physicalconditions.TheCassini‚ÄìHuygensmission, launched in 1997, entered the Saturnian system July 1,2004. This dual mission is composed of the Cassini orbiter, which was built by NASAwith the high-gain antenna system provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), and theHuygens probe, which was built by the European Space Agency (ESA). At the time of thiswriting in 2006, Cassini is exploring the Saturnian system at length during its four-yearmission, including the planet, its moons, and its rings. Huygens descended into the thickatmosphere of Titan, the largest of Saturn‚Äôs moons on January 14, 2005. Like the Galileoprobe, Huygens used a parachute during part of its descent while it made measurementsof composition, wind speed, atmospheric structure, and surface features. At an altitude of40 km, the parachute was be released and the probe fell to the surface. The descent took twohours and 27 minutes, and the probe remained operational on the surface for an additionalone hour and 10 minutes, while further observations were made.Composition and StructureHowever,thegroupcanbefurthersubdivided.ThegasgiantsofJupiter(317.83 M‚äï)and Saturn (95.159 M‚äï) have average compositions that are quite similar to the Sun‚Äôs,2The last signal received from Pioneer 10 occurred on January 23, 2003, almost 31 years after the spacecraft‚Äôslaunch.

while the much smaller and more distant ice giants, Uranus (14.536 M‚äï) and Neptune(17.147 M‚äï), have higher proportions of heavier elements. Because each of the giant plan-ets is capable of retaining all of the lighter elements in its atmosphere, this compositiondifference suggests important differences in their formation.This conclusion is supported by direct observations of the composition of each giantplanet near the cloud tops. Table 1 gives the relative number densities of constituents inthe giant planet atmospheres; the Sun‚Äôs photospheric composition is given for comparison.(Note that it is the percentage of atoms or molecules bynumberthat is being quoted, not theUranus and Neptune are overabundant in methane relative to solar by a factor of 10 ormore.

This is due to the growing contribution of degenerate electron pressurein these cold, massive bodies.The Distribution of Mass Inside the PlanetsOther information concerning the distribution of mass in the interior is obtained by observingthe motions of moons, rings, and spacecraft. For a spherically symmetric planet, all of themass acts gravitationally as if it is located at a point in the center, but a rapidly rotating planetproduces a more complex gravitational interaction with passing objects. By comparing theactual motion of a spacecraft with what would be expected if the planet were sphericallysymmetric, it becomes possible to map the mass distribution in the interior in terms ofmathematical corrections to a spherical shape. This is just what was done using the Magellanspacecraft around Venus.One such correction is theoblatenessof the planet, which describes how Ô¨Çattened it is.Such rotational Ô¨Çattening is readily apparent in Fig. 1. For instance, Jupiter‚Äôs equatorialradius (Re) is 71,493 km and its polar radius (Rp) is only 66,855 km at an atmosphericThe Realms of the Giant Planets
results in increased interior pressure, which in turn leads to changes in the state of the at-oms and molecules.

However, although the data suggest dense cores, the massesof the cores are relatively poorly constrained. For example, note that Eq. ( 5) is stronglydependent onf‚â§1, and recall that the higher gravitational moments selectively sample theouter envelope of the planet. Based on the available data and numerical models, it appearsthat Jupiter probably has a rock/ice core of less than about 10 M‚äï, while Saturn‚Äôs core maybe about 15 M‚äïwith an uncertainty of perhaps 50%. (It is possible that the smaller core inJupiter could be due to some portion of the core having eroded over the age of the planet.)Despite the core masses of Jupiter and Saturn being much greater than the mass of Earth,they constitute only a small fraction of the total mass of each planet. If we assume coremasses of 10 M‚äïand 15 M‚äïfor Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, their cores represent justThe Realms of the Giant Planets

3% and 16% of the masses of the two gas giants. Hydrogen and helium make up most ofthe rest of the mass in each case.Similar studies of Uranus and Neptune result in core masses comparable to those ofJupiter and Saturn: roughly 13 M‚äïor so. However, in the cases of Uranus and Neptune,these cores constitute most of the mass of the planets. In particular, both Uranus and Neptuneprobably have 25% of their mass in the form of rock, 60% to 70% as ‚Äúices,‚Äù and only 5%to 15% in the form of hydrogen or helium gas. Clearly, Uranus and Neptune are not simplysmallish versions of their larger siblings, and they are appropriately considered as ice giantsrather than gas giants.5Internal Heat and the Cooling Timescalebe seen in Table 3, Jupiter absorbs (and re-emits) 5.014√ó1017W of solar radiation,while 3.35√ó1017W of additional power is produced in the interior of the planet. ThissigniÔ¨Åcantly alters the energy balance and the thermal equilibrium temperature that wouldresult from solar blackbody radiation alone. In Neptune‚Äôs case, more than one-half of theheat being radiated originates from the interior, explaining why it‚Äôs effective temperatureis very close to that of Uranus, even though Neptune is much farther from the Sun.One source of internal heat for the giant planets is the gravitational potential energy thatwas released by gases collapsing onto them during formation. This is just a consequenceof the virial theoremand is the same Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz mechanism.Neglecting any slight differences due to composition and density, for a given speciÔ¨Åc heatcapacity the total thermal energy content of a planet is proportional to its volume (i.e.,‚àùR3).However, the rate at which heat leaves a planet by blackbody radiation is proportional tosurface area (‚àùR2). Thus, without an additional source of energy, the timescale for coolingdepends on radius asœÑcool=total energy contentenergy loss/time‚àùR3/R2‚àùR.TABLE 3Energy Budgets and Effective Temperatures of the Giant Planets.

Another group of observations that provides hints about the formation and structure of the planets and their subsequent evolution is the detection of heat leaking out from the interior. In the terrestrial planets, the heat generated in the interior is due in large part to the slow decay of radioactive isotopes. However, this is not sufÔ¨Åcient to account for the large quantities of heat coming from the interiors of the giant worlds. For example, as can

The characteristic time required for a planet to cool is roughly proportional to the planet‚Äôsradius. Extrapolating back in time, the giant planets must have been much more luminouswhen the Solar System was in its infancy; Jupiter may have even glowed visibly.Since Jupiter is larger than Saturn (as well as being closer to the Sun), it should haveremained hotter for a longer period of time and should still be radiating energy into space ata greater rate. In Saturn‚Äôs case, however, the energy available from the primordial collapseis not sufÔ¨Åcient to account for all of the heat now observed to be coming from the planet.The solution to the puzzle of Saturn‚Äôs additional heat source lies in the observation that itshelium is signiÔ¨Åcantly depleted in the upper atmosphere. Referring to Table 1, note thathelium only accounts for about 3% of the particles in Saturn‚Äôs upper atmosphere, whilethe value is closer to 16% for Jupiter and nearly 20% for the Sun. The slow sinking of theheavier helium atoms relative to hydrogen through the atmosphere causes a change in thegravitational potential energy of the planet and the accompanying generation of heat viathe virial theorem. This effect has been more pronounced in Saturn because the planet issomewhat cooler.Modeling the Interiors of the Giant PlanetsModeling the interiors of the giant planets is done in much the same way it is done forstars; the major difference is the kind of material used in their construction. For example, atthe relatively cool temperatures and high pressures of the giant planet interiors, hydrogentakes on a very strange form by terrestrial standards. As we move deeper into the planet,the familiar form of molecular hydrogen becomes so compressed that the molecular bondsare broken and the orbital electrons become shared among the atoms. This is very similarto the behavior of a metal; the hydrogen inside the planet takes on the characteristics ofa molten metal, much like mercury at room temperature. This exotic equation of stateof hydrogen has been veriÔ¨Åed in terrestrial laboratories by creating shock waves in thegas that produce temperatures of several thousand kelvins and pressures of millions ofatmospheres. It appears thatliquid metallic hydrogenactually dominates the interiors ofJupiter and Saturn. For Uranus and Neptune, the pressures probably do not get large enoughto convert hydrogen into its liquid metallic form, but the ices present in their atmospheres(such as methane and ammonia) become ionized by the pressure.The interior structures of the giant planets are depicted in Fig. 6. The regions labeled‚Äúinhomogeneous‚Äù for the gas giants are where helium becomes insoluble in hydrogen,and helium-rich droplets form. These droplets then sink deeper into the planet, releasinggravitational potential energy. In the case of Saturn the helium may have settled into thecore or formed a shell around the core. Uranus and Neptune have very little hydrogen andhelium and are dominated by ices and rock.The Upper AtmospheresIn their upper atmospheres, the very colorful and dynamic cloud tops of Jupiter, the moremuted hues of Saturn, and the deep blue-greens of Uranus and Neptune owe their beautyto the temperature, composition, rotation, and internal structures of the planets. Observa-tional data, combined with theoretical modeling, suggest that Jupiter‚Äôs clouds exist in threelayers. Clouds in the top layer are composed of ammonia, the next layer is probably com-posed of ammonium hydrosulÔ¨Åde, and the clouds in the deepest layer are made of water.The Realms of the Giant Planets

Sci.,33, 493, 2005.)The coloration in the clouds of both Jupiter and Saturn is caused by their atmospheres‚Äôcompositions, although which colors are associated with which molecules remains unclear;suggestions include sulfur, phosphorus, or various organic (carbon-rich) compounds. InJupiter and Saturn, the bluish regions apparently have higher temperatures, indicating thatthey lie deeper in the atmosphere. At progressively higher altitudes are brown, white, andred clouds.Overall, the clouds are located deeper in the atmosphere of Saturn when compared withJupiter, and hence are not as dramatic. In Uranus and Neptune, reÔ¨Çective clouds of ammoniaand sulfur are located deep in the atmosphere.As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, theblue wavelengths are scattered most efÔ¨Åciently by the molecules. In addition, the presenceof methane in the atmosphere tends to absorb the red light.The Comet P/Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 Impacts on JupiterDuring July 16‚Äì22, 1994, Jupiter took center stage as it got pummeled by the fragments ofComet P/Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9(SL9). The comet was discovered in March 1993, althoughit had apparently been orbiting Jupiter for decades. Extrapolating the comet‚Äôs orbit back intime, it appears that SL9 broke apart on July 8, 1992, as it passed within 1.6RJof Jupiter,well within the planet‚Äôs Roche limit.

Jupiter. Various predictions had indicated that some direct evidence of the impacts might beobservable from Earth, but the spectacular display that ensued far exceeded expectations.Figure 7(b) shows several images of the enormous plume that rose 3500 km above thecloud tops when fragment G (believed to be the largest) entered the atmosphere of theplanet. Even though each of the collisions occurred just beyond our view, on the side ofJupiter away from Earth, the plumes were high enough to make them visible above thelimb. The Ô¨Åreballs reached temperatures of 7500 K, greater than the effective temperatureof the Sun. Data for the G impact indicate that the temperature cooled to 4000 K after Ô¨Åveseconds. Analysis of the data indicated that the largest fragments were no more than 700 macross.Immediately after each of the larger collisions, scars appeared in the atmosphere greaterin diameter than Earth [see Figs. 7(c) and (d)]. The dark nature of the marks was probablydue to organic molecules rich in sulfur and nitrogen that were present in the atmospherebefore the collision. It is also possible that some of the coloration was due to carbon-basedcompounds, like graphite, that contained silicates delivered by the comet fragments. ByDecember 1994, the marks had been torn apart by the motions in Jupiter‚Äôs atmosphere,forming a ring around the planet that eventually dissipated completely.Atmospheric DynamicsThe most famous atmospheric feature on Jupiter is itsGreat Red Spot, apparent inFigs. 1(a) and 8(a). This huge anticyclonic storm, which measures roughly one Earthdiameter wide by two Earth diameters long, has been observed for more than three centuries.Smaller but similar features can be seen in the atmospheres of each of the giant worlds.Another characteristic shared by these planets is the banded cloud structure following linesof constant latitude. In the case of Uranus the banded cloud features are very difÔ¨Åcult to

The circulation within Jupiter‚Äôs Great Red Spot is attributable toits location between two rivers of atmosphere moving in opposite directions (see Fig. 9).Despite these apparently long-lived features, the atmospheres are very dynamic, withrapid changes occurring on small scales, including rotation around the more stable cyclonicstructures. It is worth noting, however, that large features are not necessarily permanenteither. For instance, when V oyager 2 visited Neptune in 1989, it discovered theGreat DarkSpotin the southern hemisphere, shown in Figs. 1(d) and 8(b). Later, when the planetwas observed again by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994, the Great Dark Spot was gone.Then, in 1995, another dark spot appeared in the northern hemisphere.is similarly redirected. However, the atmospheric circulation of Uranus has an interestingaspect not shared with the other giant planets. Unlike any other planet in the Solar Systemexcept Pluto, Uranus is almost lying on its side; its rotation axis is tilted 97.9‚ó¶to the ecliptic.This implies that each pole has the Sun overhead for a portion of its 84-year orbit. Duringthose periods one would expect heat to be transported from the subsolar pole to the one thatis in darkness. Yet, when V oyager 2 passed Uranus in 1986, at about the time when one ofthe poles was pointed toward the Sun, the visible Ô¨Çow patterns were still largely parallel tothe planet‚Äôs equator, due to the planet‚Äôs rapid rotation and the effects of the Coriolis force.How Uranus was able to transport heat away from the subsolar pole without detectablepole-to-pole Ô¨Çow patterns remains an open question.Another noticeable difference between Uranus and the rest of the giant worlds is its lackof prominent vortexes. This may correspond to the lack of any detectable heat Ô¨Çow outwardThe Realms of the Giant Planets
Just as the Coriolis force redirects the large-scale circulation in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere from north‚Äìsouth to predominantly east‚Äìwest Ô¨Çow patterns in each hemisphere, Hadley circulation in the more rapidly rotating giant planets (particularly Jupiter and Saturn)

from the deep interior. Although it must certainly exist, the rate of heat Ô¨Çow is clearly muchless pronounced than in the other three giants.Magnetic FieldsThe molten iron‚Äìnickel core of Earth is the source of its magnetic Ô¨Åeld. In the giant planets,it is liquid metallic hydrogen that appears to Ô¨Åll that role, at least in Jupiter and Saturn. Rapidrotation generates electric currents in the conducting interiors of the planets. Because themagnetic Ô¨Åelds are almost certainly anchored deep in their interiors, measuring the rotationperiods of the Ô¨Åelds provides a method of determining the rotation periods of their interiors.In the 1950s, measurements of the radio-wavelength radiation being emitted from Jupiterrevealed both thermal and nonthermal components. The thermal radiation is just part of theenergy being given off by the planet itself (blackbody radiation). However, the strongtrapped in it. The measured strength of the Ô¨Åeld is some 19,000 times greater than Earth‚ÄôsÔ¨Åeld.Another interesting consequence of the SL9 collisions in Jupiter‚Äôs southern hemisphere[which all occurred at nearly the same latitude; see Fig. 7(d)] was the appearance ofan auroral display in the northern hemisphere, not unlike the aurorae seen on Earth.Apparently, charged particles near the collision sites acquired sufÔ¨Åcient kineticenergy that they traveled along Jupiter‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines, colliding with the atmospherein the north within 45 minutes following the impacts.The physical extent of Jupiter‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld is enormous.The planet‚Äôsmagnetosphere,deÔ¨Åned to be the space enveloped by its magnetic Ô¨Åeld, has a diameter of 3√ó1010m, 210times the size of the planet and 22 times larger than the Sun. Because of Jupiter‚Äôs rapidrotation, the charged particles trapped in its Ô¨Åeld are spread out into acurrent sheetthatis situated alongthe Ô¨Åeld‚Äô sequator (the Ô¨Åeld axis is inclined 9.5‚ó¶to the rotation axis ofthe planet). Given the large numbers of particles present in Jupiter‚Äôs current sheet, anothersource of charged particles beyond those supplied by the solar wind must exist. The solutionto this mystery came when the V oyager spacecraft Ô¨Årst observed Jupiter‚Äôs moon Io.2THE MOONS OF THE GIANTSMany of the most spectacular and fascinating images returned by the V oyager, Galileo,and Cassini‚ÄìHuygens missions were of the moons of the giant planets, beginning with theGalilean moons of Jupiter (Fig. 10). The relative sizes of the Galilean moons are depictedin Fig. 11.Io(shown in more detail in Fig. 12) is the closest of the four large Galileanmoons to Jupiter. It is a bizarre-looking yellowish-orange world with as many as nine activevolcanoes observed to be erupting simultaneously.Europa(Fig. 13) is covered with athin layer of water-ice that is criss-crossed by cracks and nearly devoid of any cratering.Ganymede(Fig. 14) has a thick ice surface that shows evidence of signiÔ¨Åcant cratering.And Ô¨Ånally,Callisto(Fig. 15) appears to be covered with a layer of dust and has an old andThe Realms of the Giant Planets

Within this context, recalling that Jupiter must havebeen hotter in the past than it is today, Io would have been close enough to have had mostof its volatiles evaporate away. Moving progressively farther out, Europa would have beenable to hold on to some water, Ganymede even more, and Callisto (being the coldest of theGalilean moons at the time of its formation) would have retained the largest percentage ofvolatiles.The Realms of the Giant Planets

(Courtesy of NASA/JPL.)The Effects of Tidal Forces on IoThe consequences of this evolution can be seen in each of the Galilean moons. Considerthem in sequence beginning with the one closest to Jupiter. Because of its proximity toJupiter, Io experiences the most severe tidal forces. Even though the moon‚Äôs rotation periodis the same as its orbital period, small deviations from a perfectly circular orbit mean that itsorbital velocity is not constant. Consequently, the moon tends to wobble, not quite keepingone side ‚Äúlocked in place‚Äù toward Jupiter. This effect is due to the curious resonance thatexists among the orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Their orbital periods form ratiosthat are approximately 1:2:4, meaning that both Europa and Ganymede perturb Io‚Äôs orbitat about the same location each time Io orbits the planet. This forces Io‚Äôs orbit to remainslightly elliptical.The Realms of the Giant Planets

(Courtesy of NASA/JPL.)Based on gravitational data from Galileo‚Äôs close Ô¨Çybys of Io, it appears that Io has an iron-rich core, a molten silicate mantle, and a thin silicate crust (the moon‚Äôs average density is3530 kg m‚àí3). This structure suggests that Io was entirely molten at least once, and perhapsnumerous times, allowing the moon to become chemically differentiated. Lava Ô¨Çows andlakes of lava, such as Loki Patera (which is larger than the island of Hawaii) are clearlyevident on the surface of Io. It is important to note, however, that Io‚Äôs volcanoes do notoperate in quite the same way that Earth-based volcanoes do. Instead, the eruptions may beThe Realms of the Giant Planets

somewhat more analogous to the geysers seen in such places as Yellowstone National Park.In terrestrial geysers, rapid phase transitions from water to steam force the steam upward athigh velocity through cracks in the surface. On Io, sulfur and sulfur dioxide (SO2) probablyplay the same role. In fact, SO2has been detected over volcanic vents and in Io‚Äôs very thinatmosphere. The yellowish-orange surface is due to sulfur raining back down on the moonfrom its continually erupting volcanoes. The constant eruptions are always regenerating themoon‚Äôs surface; Io is literally turning itself inside out.Io‚Äôs Interaction with Jupiter‚Äôs Magnetic FieldAll of the Galilean moons are located deep inside Jupiter‚Äôs magnetosphere, but Io interactswith the magnetic Ô¨Åeld most strongly. Since Jupiter rotates in just under 10 hours, whereasIo orbits the planet in 1.77 days, Jupiter‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld sweeps past Io at a speed of about57 km s‚àí1. This motion through the magnetic Ô¨Åeld sets up an electric potential differenceacross the moon, estimated to be 600 kV . The potential difference acts much like a battery,causing a current of nearly 106amps to Ô¨Çow back and forth along magnetic Ô¨Åeld linesbetween Io and Jupiter. This current Ô¨Çow of charged particles in the magnetic Ô¨Åeld alsogenerates Joule heating within the moon, analogous to a resistor in a circuit. RoughlyP=IV‚àº6√ó1011W is generated in this way. However, this contribution to the totalinternal heating of the moon is only a small fraction of the total energy liberated from thesurface per second, which is approximately 1014W.That Io must have some interaction with Jupiter‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld has been known forsome time. When Jupiter, Io, and Earth are in certain alignments, bursts of decameter-wavelength radiation are detected. Not all the details of the process are yet understood, butthe bursts appear to be associated with the electrical current Ô¨Çowing between Jupiter andits volcanic moon.Io must also be responsible for the excessive number of charged particles trapped inJupiter‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld, although it is unlikely that they escaped directly from the moon‚Äôsvolcanoes since the ejection speeds are much less than Io‚Äôs escape velocity. Instead, aprocess referred to assputteringhas been proposed; oxygen and sulfur ions from Jupiter‚Äôsmagnetosphere impacting on the moon‚Äôs surface or in its atmosphere may provide sufÔ¨Åcientenergy for other sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and potassium atoms to escape. In fact, clouds ofsulfur and sodium (known as theIo torus) have been detected around Jupiter at the locationof Io‚Äôs orbit. On the order of 1027to 1029ions leave Io and enter Jupiter‚Äôs magnetosphericplasma every second.EuropaEuropa‚Äôs surface seems to be continually refreshed. Based on the near absence of cratering,it appears that most of the surface is less than 100 million years old, supporting the idea thata layer of liquid water may exist below the surface. In fact, observations from the Galileomission indicate an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle, a possible subsurface ocean, and a thinice crust; the average density of Europa is 3010 kg m‚àí1, less than the density of Io. Thewater ocean/ice crust is collectively about 150 km thick. The source of the heat required toThis is just Faraday‚Äôs law of induction.7

keep the subsurface water at least partially melted is probably the weak tidal interactionswith Jupiter and the other Galilean moons. The cracks running across the moon‚Äôs surfaceappear to be stress fractures induced by those tidal forces combined with tectonic activity.In 1994 the Hubble Space Telescope detected a thin molecular oxygen atmosphere aroundEuropa. That observation was conÔ¨Årmed by both Galileo and the Ô¨Çyby of the Cassinispacecraft on its way to a rendezvous with Saturn. Cassini also found the presence ofatomic hydrogen in Europa‚Äôs atmosphere. It has been suggested that the atmosphere is dueto sputtering of the surface water-ice resulting from the interaction of Europa with Jupiter‚Äôsmagnetosphere.Given the presence of subsurface heating, a likely source of liquid water, and the prob-ability of organic materials being either intrinsic to the moon or delivered by comets andmeteorites, it has been widely speculated that Europa may be a site for the evolution of life.Even though no evidence exists for the presence of life today or in the past on Europa, atthe end of its operational lifetime scientists intentionally sent the Galileo spacecraft intothe crushing atmosphere of Jupiter on September 21, 2003, in order to avoid any futureinadvertent collision with Europa and its possible subsurface ocean.GanymedeGanymede‚Äôs surface also shows a complex series of ridges and grooves that strongly suggestsome history of tectonic activity on this ice world. This is supported by gravitational datafrom Galileo indicating a likely partially molten iron core, a silicate lower mantle, an icyupper mantle, an ice crust, and an average density of only 1940 kg m‚àí1. It has been proposedthat before the ice crust became too rigid, convection in the interior was responsible forcarrying heat to the surface. This convective motion also caused movement of the surfacecrust, much like the current action of tectonic plates on Earth. As a result, although thesurface is certainly much older and more heavily cratered than Europa‚Äôs, the surface hasbeen at least partially refreshed during its history.CallistoCallisto apparently cooled and solidiÔ¨Åed quite rapidly after material accreted out of thelocal subnebula around Jupiter. As a result, its surface continued to collect dust as thenebula thinned, blanketing the moon with the dark material. Evidence that Callisto solidiÔ¨Åedquickly is also apparent in the structure of its interior. Models suggest that the interior of themoon is relatively simple, with a partially differentiated interior of ice and rock, an ice-richcrust, and the lowest density of the Galilean moons (1830 kg m‚àí3). Having solidiÔ¨Åed inthe early stages of the formation of the Solar System, Callisto was also subject to frequentimpacts of the still-abundant objects that traveled among the newly formed planets andmoons. Evidence of the nebular dust accretion and the impacts remains today. The whitish-appearing impact craters are the result of ice being exposed during the collisions.A UniÔ¨Åed Formation of the Galilean MoonsAs we have seen, the four Galilean satellites of Jupiter exhibit a trend of decreasing densitywith distance from their parent planet. Given the evident trends in their properties, includingtheir internal structure (diminishing iron-rich cores and increasing water-ice content withThe Realms of the Giant Planets

distance from Jupiter), it is apparent that they likely formed systematically with Jupiter,perhaps out of a subnebula around the planet. This is also supported by the fact that eachof the Galilean moons orbit prograde and in the equatorial plane of the planet.The Smaller Moons of JupiterOther, smaller moons also orbit in a prograde direction in the equatorial plane of Jupiter.These additionalregular satellitesmay have formed out of the subnebula as well. However,there are a large number of moons around Jupiter that orbit well out of the equatorial planeand, in many cases, in retrograde orbits. It seems that theseirregular satellitesof Jupitermay be captured objects that happened to wander by at some point in time. Still other verysmall satellites may becollisional shardsproduced by meteoritic collisions with largersatellites.Space does not allow us to discuss each of these many moons in detail. Similarly, we areunable to discuss most of the smaller moons orbiting the other giant planets; rather, we willfocus our attention on the larger moons and a few of the more unusual smaller satellites ofSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Saturn‚Äôs Titan with Its Thick AtmosphereWhen the two V oyager spacecraft reached Saturn in 1980 and 1981, they were directed toexamineTitan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System (Ganymede being the largest).Ever since Gerard P. Kuiper (1905‚Äì1973) detected methane gas around Titan in the 1940s,astronomers have wondered about the nature of this distant, atmospheric world. When theimages began arriving, scientists saw a moon with an atmosphere so Ô¨Ålled with suspendedparticles (aerosols) that no pictures of its obscured surface were possible.The joint Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission arrived in the Saturnian system in July 2004. Afterarrival, the Huygens probe detached from the Cassini orbiter and descended to the surfaceof Titan on January 14, 2005. During its descent, the Huygens probe was able to measurewind speeds of up to 210 m s‚àí1, sample the composition of the atmosphere, and, afterpassing through the high-altitude smog layer of hydrocarbons, obtain images of the surface(see Fig. 16).The dominant constituent in the atmosphere is nitrogen (N2), which constitutes some-where between 87% and 99% of the gases. Methane (CH4) makes up between 1% and 6%of the atmosphere, and argon (Ar) constitutes between 0% and 6% of the total. Numerousother species are present in smaller amounts, including molecular hydrogen (H2), carbonmonoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and a host of additionalhydrocarbons, such as acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), methylacetylene(C3H4), propane (C3H8), and diacetylene (C4H2). The aerosols in the high-altitude smoglayer are probably just condensed forms of these compounds.At the base of the atmosphere, the pressure is approximately 1.5 atm and the temperatureis 93 K. With those conditions, methane is able to condense as a liquid and then evaporateagain, and thus it plays a role much like that of water on Earth. At the Huygens landingsite, the ground was moist, with liquid methane occurring a few centimeters below thesurface. It is possible that it had rained methane at that location shortly before the arrivalof Huygens. In fact, Huygens sank 10 to 15 cm into the soft ground at the landing site.

It exhibits a very large impact crater (referred to as Herschel) that is testimonyto a collision almost energetic enough to fracture it. Of course Saturn also has numerousMore than one researcher has noticed that Mimas bears a strong resemblance to the‚ÄúDeath Star‚Äùin the GeorgeLucasÔ¨ÅlmStar Wars, LucasÔ¨Ålm Ltd.

One explanation for its amazingtopography is that one or more collisions actually succeeded in breaking the moon apart.When gravity pulled all of the pieces back together, they didn‚Äôt quiteÔ¨Åt. Portions of the rockcore tried to settle back to the center of the moon while ice tried toÔ¨Çoat back to the surface.This proposed rearrangement of the structure of Miranda produced a strange surface withThe Realms of the Giant Planets

cliffs as tall as 20 km (twice the height of Mount Everest) and features such as the‚Äúchevron‚Äùthat can be seen in theÔ¨Ågure.An alternative explanation for Miranda‚Äôs topography proposes that tidal forces exertedby Uranus on the small moon caused parts of the surface to be pulled apart. This allowedwarmer material in the interior (which was heated by tidal effects) to rise to the surface,producing the ridges and troughs that are observed.Interestingly, all of the regular moons of Uranus, and, as we will see in the next section, itsring system as well, orbit near the equatorial plane of the planet rather than its orbital plane.Recall that the rotation axis of Uranus is highly inclined to the ecliptic (97.9‚ó¶), making theorientation of the Uranusian system a puzzle for Solar System dynamicists.Neptune‚Äôs TritonThe last and one of the most unusual moons visited by V oyager 2 was Neptune‚Äôs largestmoon,Triton(Fig. 19). With a surface temperature of 37 K, it is also the coldest worldyet visited. The moon‚Äôs southern pole is covered with a pinkish frost that is composedalmost entirely of nitrogen. Along with the nitrogen frost, other surface ices include CH4,CO, and CO2. Also present are very large‚Äúfrozen lakes‚Äùof water-ice that show very littlecratering, indicative of a relatively young age. The water-ice may have erupted from icevolcanos.During the V oyager 2Ô¨Çyby, geyser-like jets were detected forcing plumes of gas 8 km upinto Triton‚Äôs tenuous atmosphere, where the plumes were blown down-wind. These plumesmay simply be gas rising from a warm source inside the planet, but how they are initiatedremains unclear.The atmosphere of Triton is composed predominantly of nitrogen, like the atmospheres ofEarth, Titan, and Pluto. However, unlike Earth and Titan, Triton‚Äôs atmosphere is extremelythin, with a pressure of only 1.6√ó10‚àí5atm. Much of the atmosphere may be a consequenceof the jets of nitrogen gas erupting from the interior of the moon.

‚ó¶widely believed that Triton was captured by Neptune. It is also likely that when the relativelymassive Triton was captured, it signiÔ¨Åcantly disrupted Neptune‚Äôs already-existing systemof much smaller satellites. Perhaps the tidal effects that resulted in the moon‚Äôs present-daycircularized and synchronous orbit could have produced sufÔ¨Åcient internal heating to causefaulting and its cantaloupe-like terrain.3PLANETARY RING SYSTEMSEach of the giant planets contains a ring system. Although Saturn‚Äôs prominent rings wereÔ¨Årst seen several hundred years ago, the rings of the other planets weren‚Äôt discovered untilthe 1970s and 1980s. As we will learn, there are certainly some similarities among the ringsystems, but there are signiÔ¨Åcant differences as well.The Structure of Saturn‚Äôs RingsArguably, the most well-known feature of the Saturnian system is its spectacular set ofrings, seen in Fig. 1(b). Based on observations made from Earth, several fairly distinctrings have long been known to exist, labeled (from the outside in) A, B, and C. Between theprominent A and B rings, theCassini divisionwas thought to be virtually devoid of ringmaterial. Another empty region, called theEncke gap, was observed within the A ring.After the planet was visited by the V oyager spacecraft, other rings were discovered.The two spacecraft also revealed previously unexpected complexity in the system. As canbe seen in Fig. 20(b), instead of large, almost continuous rings, thousands ofringletswere discovered; even the Cassini division has a number of rings lying in it, although thenumber density of the particles is much lower than in the neighboring regions. The F ringproved to be particularly perplexing because it is very narrow and appears to be braided[Fig. 21(a)].ripples in the disk gives the rings the appearance of being about 1 km thick. Because of thethinness of the disk, when it is viewed perpendicular to the plane, the optical depth of thering system ranges from about 0.1 to 2. It is actually possible to see through the rings inmany locations.When Galileo observed Saturn in 1612 (some two years after his initial observations),he was surprised to discover that the protrusions that he had seen earlier had apparentlyvanished! We now know that during his later set of observations, Galileo was viewing therings edge-on, making them undetectable from Earth.The reason the rings are so thin is easily understood by considering what happens toparticles that undergo partially inelastic collisions, as shown in Fig. 22. Imagine twoparticles circling Saturn in the same direction but in orbits that are slightly tilted with respectto each other. If the two particles should collide, thex-components of their velocities wouldThe Realms of the Giant PlanetsTriton‚Äôs slowly decaying retrograde orbit.

The processdiminishes the thickness of the disk until other effects start to become important, such asrandom collisions with incoming particles and perturbations from moons.The Composition of Saturn‚Äôs RingsMost of the particles that make up the rings are quite small, with the majority havingdiameters that range from a few centimeters to several meters, although it seems likelythat at least some particles with diameters as small as a few micrometers or as large asone kilometer may exist in the system. Size estimates are derived from several piecesof evidence, including the rate at which particles cool off in Saturn‚Äôs shadow and howefÔ¨Åciently they reÔ¨Çect radar signals of various wavelengths.The Realms of the Giant Planets

It has been known for some time that the material in the Saturnian rings is highly reÔ¨Çective(the rings have albedos in the range 0.2‚Äì0.6).Albedo measurements, combined with infraredspectroscopy, provide information about the composition of ring material. It appears thatthe particles of most of the rings are primarily water-ice, with some dust embedded in themor covering their surfaces. However, the very extended and thin E ring may be composedentirely of dust that is originating from the nearby moon, Enceladus.Jupiter‚Äôs Tenuous Ring SystemJupiter‚Äôs very tenuous ring system [see Fig. 20(a)] has a characteristic optical depth ofroughly 10‚àí6. Three components have been seen: the innermosttoroidal halo, themainring, and the outermostgossamerring. Taken together they stretch from near Jupiter toabout 3 RJ. It is believed that the ring material is primarily dust that is constantly resuppliedby collisions of micrometeorites with larger objects (tiny moons) in the rings.The Rings of UranusThe rings of Uranus and Neptune [Figs. 20(c) and (d)] wereÔ¨Årst detected indirectlyfrom Earth and later photographed by V oyager 2. On March 10, 1977, astronomers wereobserving theoccultationof a background star (Uranus passing in front of the star). Theywere trying to measure the diameter of Uranus, as well as to gather some informationabout its atmosphere. Knowing the speed of the planet and the amount of time the star washidden, they could determine the planet‚Äôs diameter. Quite unexpectedly, the starlight fadedand brightened several times before actually being occulted by the planet. When the starreappeared, the pattern of alternating fading and brightening was repeated, but in reverseorder. The astronomers realized that rings were blocking out the star‚Äôs light. The sameprocedure was used for Neptune but led to confusing results. In some cases the starlightwas blocked on only one side of the planet, leading to the suggestion that only incompleterings (or arcs) exist around Neptune.A total of thirteen rings have been detected around Uranus, nine from the ground, twomore by V oyager 2 in 1986, and another two by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004. Allof the rings are remarkably narrow, ranging in width from 10 km to 100 km (not unlikethe F ring of Saturn), with some of the rings also showing signs of being braided. The twodetected using the HST have diameters that are much greater than the other eleven rings,leading some researchers to refer to them as a second Uranian ring system.The composition of the Uranian rings appears to be very different from that of eitherJupiter or Saturn. ReÔ¨Çecting only about 1% of the incident sunlight, the ring material isextremely dark. This is because the rings are composed largely of dust, rather than ice.Curiously, as mentioned in the previous section, the rings and moons of Uranus lie inthe planet‚Äôs equatorial plane and not along the ecliptic. Recalling that the rotation axis ofUranus is tilted 97.9‚ó¶with respect to the ecliptic, this implies that the orientation of theorbits of the rings and moons changed after one or more catastrophic impacts dramaticallyshifted Uranus‚Äôs axis (if indeed impacts were responsible). Apparently Uranus‚Äôs rotation-ally produced equatorial bulge gravitationally affected its satellites and ring material, ulti-mately reorienting their orbits until the moons and rings were once again aligned withthe planet‚Äôs equator. Similarly, Saturn‚Äôs rings are also aligned with its equator, despite theplanet‚Äôs equatorial plane being tilted almost 27‚ó¶to its orbital plane.The Realms of the Giant Planets

Neptune‚Äôs RingsWhen it reached Neptune, V oyager 2 also found rings orbiting that planet. Like the ringsof Uranus, several of the six identiÔ¨Åed rings are quite narrow, while the others appear tobe diffuse sheets of dust. Oddly, the outermost ring, known as Adams, hasÔ¨Åve discreteregions of concentrated material, like sausages on a string. It was these concentrations thatwere responsible for the arcs that were deduced from occultations.Physical Processes Affecting Ring SystemsThe spectacular observations of the V oyagers, Galileo, and Cassini have shown us that thedynamics of ring systems are quite complex. Not all of the features are as yet understood,but many important components have been identiÔ¨Åed:‚Ä¢Collisionshave already been mentioned as the process that maintains the thinness ofthe rings.‚Ä¢Keplerian shear(or diffusion) spreads the rings out in the system‚Äôs plane. As morerapidly moving particles in slightly lower orbits overtake more slowly moving parti-cles farther out, collisions between them cause the inner particles to slow somewhat,and they drift closer to the planet.At the same time, the outer particles are accelerated,moving them outward. The process stops when the density of ring particles becomesso low that collisions effectively cease.‚Ä¢Shepherd moonsare small moons that reside in or near the edge of the rings, con-trolling the location of ring boundaries via their gravitational interactions. The nar-rowness of the F ring of Saturn [recall Fig. 21(a)] was understood when the twomoons Pandora and Prometheus were discovered to be orbiting just outside and in-side the ring, respectively. As the more rapidly moving ring particles pass Pandora,the moon‚Äôs gravitational pull slows them down, causing the particles to drift inward.When Prometheus overtakes the ring particles, it pulls them forward, speeding themup and causing them to move outward. As a result, the F ring is conÔ¨Åned to a narrowregion just 100 km wide. Another shepherd moon (Atlas) deÔ¨Ånes the sharp outer edgeof the A ring. Shepherd moons have also been discovered guiding one of the rings ofUranus; see Fig. 21(b).‚Ä¢Orbital resonancesbetween moons and ring particles in speciÔ¨Åc orbits can act todeplete or enhance particle concentrations. (It is also necessary that the orbital planeof the moon align with the ring plane.) For instance, there exists a 2:1 orbital res-onance between Mimas and particles at the inner edge of the Cassini division. Inother words, a particle in that location orbits twice for every orbit of Mimas. Sincean inferior conjunction of such a particle with Mimas always occurs at the same po-sition, gravitational perturbations of the particle‚Äôs orbit produced by Mimas becomecumulative, implying that the moon tends to force the particle into an elliptical orbit.The Adams ring, along with the Leverrier and Galle rings, were named for the mathematical and observationaldiscoverers of Neptune.9

As the particle begins to cross the more circular orbits of particles at other radii, col-lisions become more likely. The outcome is that the particle has been removed fromits original orbit and relocated in another part of the system.‚Ä¢Spiral density waves,Ô¨Årst proposed by Peter Goldreich and Scott Tremaine in thelate 1970s, are set up by moons as a consequence of orbital resonance. Gravitationalperturbations can cause particles at different orbital radii to bunch up, effectivelyincreasing their gravitational inÔ¨Çuence on other nearby particles in the disk. Thoseneighboring particles in turn are drawn toward the increase in density, extending theenhancement. If the moon responsible for the resonance is beyond the edge of thedisk, the wave of density enhancement spirals outward. Since the density is largerin the wave, the probability of collision increases. Keplerian shear then causes thenumber density of particles near resonance orbits to decrease. This process helpsexplain the width of the Cassini division.10‚Ä¢The Poynting‚ÄìRobertson effect(a consequence of the headlight effectcancauseringparticlestospiralintowardtheplanet.Whenparticlesintheringsabsorbsunlight,theymustre-radiatethatenergyagainiftheyaretoremainin thermal equilibrium. The original light was emitted from the Sun isotropically, butin the Sun‚Äôs rest frame the re-radiated light is concentrated in the direction of motionof the particle. Since the re-radiated light carries away momentum as well as energy,the particle slows down and its orbit decays.‚Ä¢Plasma dragis a consequence of the collisions of ring particles with charged particlestrapped in the planet‚Äôs magneticÔ¨Åeld. Since the magneticÔ¨Åeld is anchored inside theplanet, it must revolve with the rotation period of the planet. If the ring particles areinside the planet‚Äôs synchronous orbit (as most rings are), the particles will overtakethe magneticÔ¨Åeld plasma, and collisions will slow the particles down. The particleswill then spiral in toward the planet, just as with the Poynting‚ÄìRobertson effect. Ifthe ring particles are outside the synchronous orbit, they will spiral outward.‚Ä¢Atmospheric dragoccurs as particles approach the outer reaches of the planet‚Äôsatmosphere. This effect quickly causes the particles to spiral down into the planet.‚Ä¢Radial spokeshave been observed in the rings of Saturn and are attributed to theinteraction of charged dust particles with the planet‚Äôs magneticÔ¨Åeld. These spokesmove through the ring system with the rotation period of the planet, rather thanwith the orbital period of the rings. It appears that some dust particles acquire a netelectrostatic charge as a result of their frequent collisions with other dust particles.This causes the dust to become trapped in magneticÔ¨Åeld lines tens of meters abovethe plane of the rings. Sunlight that is scattered from the suspended particles producesthe observed spokes.10Spiral density waves also play an important role in the structure of spiral galaxies.The Realms of the Giant Planets

‚Ä¢Warpingof the disk is caused by the gravitational inÔ¨Çuences of the Sun and theplanet‚Äôs moons. If the Sun or the moons are not in exactly the same plane as the ring,particles in the ring are pulled out of the ring plane.Ring FormationThe formation of planetary rings is still not fully understood. A major problem lies in thetimescales involved in maintaining rings against processes that tend to disperse or destroythem. Are rings long-lived or transient phenomena? One idea,Ô¨Årst suggested by Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749‚Äì1827) and Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) in the late 1700s, arguesthat rings are nebular in origin; they were formed at the same time that the planets accreted.Since most of Saturn‚Äôs rings are composed largely of water-ice, while the rings of Jupiter,Uranus, and Neptune contain primarily nonvolatile substances (silicates and carbon), Saturnmust have cooled more rapidly, before the water could escape. Although this idea couldaccount for the spectacular Saturnian system, while also explaining the composition andgreater sparsity of the rings of the other giant planets, it is difÔ¨Åcult to understand how thesystems could be maintained for more than 4.5 billion years.It is also possible that ring systems arise due to tidal forces; if moons were drawn insidethe planet‚Äôs Roche limit, or if a comet or meteoroid ventured too close, tidal forces wouldfracture the objects, producing a new ring system. However, tidal disruption should leaveintact rocky fragments as large as tens of kilometers in diameter. Grinding and meteoriticimpacts would eventually break down the remnants, but such processes are extremely slow.On the other hand, loosely packed icy objects, such as comets, may be broken into smallerpieces by tidal disruptions (recall Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9).The discovery of the giant, outermost ring of Uranus by the HST was accompanied bythe discovery of another moon, Mab, in the same orbit as the ring. It seems that when Mabis hit by meteorites, material ejected from the moon replenishes the giant ring, suggestingthat the source for this ring, at least, has been identiÔ¨Åed.Clearly, much work remains to be done before we can claim to understand the complex-ities of planetary rings.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralBeatty, J.

Minor Bodies of the Solar System1Pluto and Charon2Comets and Kuiper Belt Objects3Asteroids4Meteorites1PLUTO AND CHARONClyde W. Tombaugh (1906‚Äì1997) discovered a small 15th-magnitude object orbiting theSun. The new object was classiÔ¨Åed as a planet and named Pluto for the Roman god of theunderworld.1It turns out that even though Pluto was discovered near its predicted position,the prediction was invalid because it was founded on statistically insigniÔ¨Åcant apparentdeviations in the orbits of the other planets.Pluto is unlike any of the terrestrial or giant planets of the Solar System; in fact, it bearsmuch more resemblance to Neptune‚Äôs moon Triton than to any other planets.Its248.5-yearorbitisveryeccentric(e=0.25).Atperihelionitisonly29.7 AU from the Sun (actually closer than Neptune), while it is 49.3 AU away at aphelion.Its orbit is also inclined signiÔ¨Åcantly from the ecliptic (17‚ó¶).Despite the fact that Pluto is a Neptune-crossing object, it is not in any danger of collid-ing with the giant world. Pluto is protected from that fate by a 3:2 orbital resonance withNeptune. Consequently, Pluto is never near perihelion when it is in conjunction with Nep-tune, and the two planets never get any closer than about 17 AU. Pluto actually approachesUranus more closely, coming within 11 AU.The Discovery of CharonMany of the most basic characteristics of Pluto, such as its mass and radius, were poorlydetermined until its largest moon,Charon, was discovered in 1978.2Figure 1 shows a1The name Pluto was suggested by Venetia Burney, who was then an 11-year-old English schoolgirl.2Prior to the discovery of Charon, Pluto‚Äôs radius was uncertain to within a factor of 4, and its mass wasn‚Äôt knownto better than a factor of 100.From Chapter 2  of An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicSecond Edition, Bradley W.

All rights reserved.by s ,2The success of the mathematical prediction of Neptune‚Äôs position led astronomers to consider the possibility that a ninth planet existed even farther from the Sun. Based on perceived anomalies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, the search began in the late nineteenth century. Finally, on February 18, 1930, after a systematic and tedious search,

FIGURE 1Pluto and its three moons. Charon was discovered in 1978, and the other two moonswere detected by the Hubble Space Telescope‚Äôs Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2005. [Courtesyof NASA, ESA, H. Weaver (JHU/APL), A. Stern (SwRI), and the Hubble Space Telescope PlutoCompanion Search Team.]Hubble Space Telescope image of the Pluto system. Pluto and Charon orbit the system‚Äôscenter of mass in 6.39 d with a separation of only 1.964√ó107m (just slightly more than1/20 of the distance between Earth and the Moon). Using Kepler‚Äôs third law, the combinedmass of the system is only 0.00247 M‚äï. Of course, to determine each mass individuallyrequires knowledge of the ratio of their separations from the system‚Äôs center of mass, whichyields a mass ratio ofMCharon/MPluto=0.124. From these data, the mass of Pluto has beenestimated to be 1.3√ó1022kg, and Charon‚Äôs mass is roughly 1.6√ó1021kg; for comparison,Triton‚Äôs mass is 2.14√ó1022kg.The Densities and Compositions of Pluto and CharonShortly after the discovery of Charon, astronomers realized that a rareeclipse seasonwouldoccur between 1985 and 1990. Since the orbital plane of the Pluto‚ÄìCharon system is inclined122.5‚ó¶to their orbit around the Sun, observers on Earth see the system edge-on only forbrief intervals once every 124 years. Fortuitously, Pluto was also at perihelion in 1989. Thenext eclipse season will not occur until the twenty-second century.The duration of the occultations provided the information necessary to determine theradius of Charon. Pluto‚Äôs radius has been determined to be 1137 km, making it only abouttwo-thirds the size of our Moon, but the occultation data indicate that Charon‚Äôs radius isabout 600 km. This means that Pluto‚Äôs average density is about 2110 kg m‚àí3and Charon‚Äôsdensity is roughly 1770 kg m‚àí3. These data seem to indicate that Pluto and Charon areprobably made of frozen ices and rock, with Pluto having a somewhat higher proportionof rock than the majority of the moons of the giant planets. The best map of the surface ofPluto obtained to date is shown in Fig. 2.It is worth noting that Triton‚Äôs density is 2050 kg m‚àí3, very similar to that of Pluto.Minor Bodies of the Solar System

FIGURE 2The surface of Pluto as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994. 85% of thesurface is represented; the south polar region was pointed away from Earth when the map wasconstructed. The observed features may be basins and craters, or perhaps frost from various ices.[Courtesy of Alan Stern (Southwest Research Institute), Marc Buie (Lowell Observatory), NASA,and ESA.]The Possible Formation of Charon by a Large ImpactWith a mass that is almost 1/8 that of Pluto, Charon is proportionately the most massivemoon in the Solar System relative to its parent planet.3It appears that Charon must haveformed as a result of a large impact on Pluto, similar to the way scientists believe our Moonformed around Earth.It is also possible that the two moons discovered in2005areadditionalproductsofthatcollision.Theimpactorprobablyhadamassofbetween0.2 and 1 MPluto.Complete Spin‚ÄìOrbit Couplingworlds have resulted in the Ô¨Ånal state of lowest energy. Because they are fully locked, thetidal forces do not produce the constantly changing bulges seen in other systems, suchas Earth‚Äôs tidal bulges produced by the Moon. Therefore, the frictional heat losses andangular momentum transfer in operation elsewhere have now ceased for the Pluto‚ÄìCharoninteraction.A necessary consequence of the locked, synchronous orbit is that Charon is locateddirectly over Pluto‚Äôs equator. If this weren‚Äôt the case, the orbital motion would carry Charonalternately north and south of Pluto‚Äôs equator, and any deviation from spherical symmetrybetween the two worlds would result in constantly changing tidal forces. Since the orbital3Our Moon, which is the second-largest satellite in the Solar System relative to its parent planet, contains onlyabout 1/81 the mass of Earth.Minor Bodies of the Solar System
Pluto and Charon also have another interesting dynamical characteristic:Both ob-jects have rotation periods that are exactly the same as their orbital period about their mutual center of mass. Since they spin in the same direction as their orbital mo-tion, Pluto and Charon keep the same faces toward each other at all times; they are completely locked in a synchronous orbit. The tidal forces between these two small

plane of the system is inclined 122.5‚ó¶to its orbit around the Sun, this implies that bothA Frozen Surface and a Changing AtmosphereIn 1992 Tobias C. Owen and collaborators used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescopeon Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to carry out a spectroscopic study of Pluto‚Äôs surface. Their workrevealed that the surface is covered with frozen nitrogen (N2), which constitutes some 97%of the total area, with carbon monoxide ice (CO) and methane ice (CH4) each accounting for1% to 2%, similar to the surface of Triton. Oddly, Charon‚Äôs surface appears to be composedprimarily of water-ice; no molecular nitrogen, carbon monoxide, or methane ices or gaseshave been detected on Charon.When Pluto occulted a faint star in 1988, a very tenuous atmosphere was detected,with a surface pressure of about 10‚àí5atm. The atmosphere is dominated by N2, with CH4and CO probably making up roughly 0.2% of the total by number, consistent with thecomposition of the surface ice and the rate of sublimation of the various species. Curiously,when Pluto occulted another star in 2002, measurements of the pressure and scale heightof the atmosphere had doubled, implying that Pluto‚Äôs atmosphere had become signiÔ¨Åcantlythicker over the 14-year period.It has been suggested that the atmosphere of this tiny, distant world is not permanent. The1988 observation of its atmosphere was made near perihelion when the planet‚Äôs temperaturewas near its maximum value of approximately 40 K. At this temperature, ices on the surfaceare able to undergo partial sublimation. The atmosphere apparently thickened between1988 and 2002 because ices continued to sublimate, releasing additional gases into theatmosphere. However, as the planet moves back toward aphelion, the atmosphere willprobably ‚Äúfreeze out‚Äù again.A Rendezvous with PlutoIn January 2006, NASA launched theNew HorizonsÔ¨Çyby mission. If all goes accordingto plan, New Horizons will pass near Pluto in 2015, giving us the Ô¨Årst close-up look atthis tiny, distant planet and its moons. Whether Pluto will still have an atmosphere at thetime of the Ô¨Çyby is one of the many interesting questions waiting to be answered about thisTrans-Neptunian quadruple system.2COMETS AND KUIPER BELT OBJECTSorbital period is 76 years).4Because of their unusual appearance when near perihelion, bright4This famous comet has probably been making its periodic tours of the inner Solar System for 23,000 years, butit was Edmond Halley who Ô¨Årst realized that these were repeated observations of the same object. The proof ofhis hypothesis was accomplished with the aid of Newton and his newly developed mechanics.Minor Bodies of the Solar SystemPluto and Charon rotate retrograde. Uranus also rotates retrograde and that its ring sys-tem and regular satellites are located directly over its equator; that orientation has also been attributed to tidal forces.
Comets such as Comet Mrkos and Comet Halley [Fig.  3(a)], have been observed frequently throughout history. In fact, the periodic visits of Comet Halley have been  recorded during each passage through the inner Solar System since at least 240 B.c. (its

He suggested that a ‚Äúdirty snowball,‚Äù roughly10 km across, lies at the center of the comet. This dirty snowball constitutes the comet‚Äôsnucleus. The nucleus is composed of ices and embedded dust grains. As the nucleus movesfrom the cold environment of the outer Solar System into the warmer regions near the Sun,the ices begin to sublimate. The released dust and gas then expand outward to produce a109-m cloud of gas and dust known as thecoma. Subsequently, the material in the comainteracts with the sunlight and solar wind, producing the very long, familiar tails (up to1 AU in length) that are always associated with our images of comets. We now know thata hydrogen gashalo(or envelope) also surrounds the coma and can have a diameter of1010m. When the comet leaves the inner Solar System, the temperature decreases sufÔ¨Å-ciently that the rate of sublimation diminishes signiÔ¨Åcantly and the halo, coma, and tailsdisappear. Cometary activity does not stop entirely, however; small outbursts can occurfrom time to time as heat from the Sun travels inward through the nucleus, releasing highlyvolatile gases.Minor Bodies of the Solar System

Work on the painting began two years after the 1301appearance of Comet Halley.The Dynamics of Comet TailsComet tails are always directed away from the Sun, as depicted in Fig. 5. Two independentmechanisms are responsible for the structure of the tails: radiation pressure on the liberateddust grains, and the interaction of ions with the solar wind and the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld.First consider the effect of radiation pressure on grains. For anidealizedspherical dustgrain of radiusRthat is located a distancerfrom the Sun and that absorbs all of the incidentlight that strikes it, the following equation can be used to calculate the outward forceThe factor of cosŒ∏means that the grain‚Äôs cross-sectional areaœÉ=œÄR2shouldbe used in calculating the force. In other words, for the case of complete absorption thesame force would be exerted if the grain were replaced by a circular disk with an identicalradius, oriented perpendicular to the light. Using‚ü®S‚ü©=L‚äô/4œÄr2for the magnitude of thetime-averaged Poynting vector, the force on the grain due to radiation pressure isFrad=‚ü®S‚ü©œÉc=L‚äô4œÄr2œÄR2c.(1)Of course the Sun‚Äôs gravity is also acting on the grain.

The smallest grains (R‚â™Œª) are inefÔ¨Åcient absorbers of light and have absorption cross sections that are much smallerthanœÄR2. Furthermore, the dust grains will scatter some of the incident light rather thanabsorb it. The effect of scattering on the radiation pressure force depends on the compositionand geometry of the dust grains and on the wavelength of the light.The Compositions of CometsIt is the scattering of light that gives dust tails their white or yellowish appearance. On theother hand, the color of an ion tail is blue because CO+ions absorb and reradiate solarphotons at wavelengths near 420 nm. However, CO+is certainly not the only species iden-tiÔ¨Åed in comets. To date, a rich variety of atoms, molecules, and ions have been discoveredspectroscopically, including some molecules that are quite complex. During its 1986 peri-helion passage, the inner coma of Comet Halley was found to contain roughly (by number)80% H2O, 10% CO, 3.5% CO2, a few percent(H2CO)n(polymerized formaldehyde), 1%methanol (CH3OH), and traces of other compounds. A partial list of chemical species thathave been found in comets is given in Table 1.Disconnection EventsThe straight ion (or plasma) tail owes its structure to a complex interaction among thecomet, the solar wind, and the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld.6Since the comet is an obstruction inthe path of the solar wind and because the relative speed of the solar wind and the cometcomet encounters a reversal in the solar magnetic Ô¨Åeld (the boundary between magneticÔ¨Åeld directions is known as asector boundary). During a disconnection event, the ion tailbreaks away and a new one forms in its place. Disconnection events are quite common andare evident in the image of Halley‚Äôs comet in Fig. 3(a), as well as in the time sequenceof Comet Hyakutake in March 1996 (Fig. 6).Robotic Investigations of CometsWhipple‚Äôs dirty-snowball hypothesis was dramatically veriÔ¨Åed in March 1986, when an in-ternational armada of spacecraft rendezvoused with Comet Halley.

As matter piles up at this bow shock, ions in the coma get trapped in the Sun‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld, loading the Ô¨Åeld down. This causes the magnet-ic Ô¨Åeld to wrap around the nucleus. The cometary ions circle the Ô¨Åeld lines and trail behind the nucleus in the antisolar direction. A disconnection event occurs when the

(¬©Shigemi Numazawa/Atlas Photo Bank/PhotoResearchers, Inc.)international cooperation, Giotto came within 596 km of the nucleus on March 14 (themission goal was 540 km).Because of the high relative velocity of Giotto and Halley (68.4k ms‚àí1), even a collisionwith a small dust grain from the nucleus could cause serious damage to the spacecraft.Therefore, to protect the instruments on board, Giotto was equipped with a 50-kg shieldmade of aluminum and plastic Kevlar. Despite these precautions, just seven seconds beforeits closest approach to the nucleus, a dust particle struck the spacecraft off-axis, causing itto wobble severely. Stability was restored again one-half hour later.Near its closest approach, the Giotto camera recorded the image of the nucleus seen inFig. 7. The size of Whipple‚Äôs dirty snowball is approximately 15 km√ó7.2k m√ó7.2k m ,and it is shaped roughly like a potato. The surface is extremely dark, with an albedo ofbetween 0.02 and 0.04. Repeated trips near the Sun have apparently left behind a layer ofdust and possibly organic material as the ices evaporated away.Visible in Fig. 7 are dust jets (ejected streams of material) located on the Sunwardside of the nucleus. The positions of the jets probably correspond to thin regions in thedark covering on the surface through which trapped, heated gases in the interior are able toescape.As the nucleus rotates, other surfaces are exposed to the Sun, and new jets develop.10‚ÄúThe Halley Encounters,‚Äù by R√ºdeger Reinhard, inThe New Solar System, Third Edition, Beatty and Chaikin(eds.), Cambridge University Press and Sky Publishing Corporation, Cambridge, MA, 1990, pp. 207‚Äì216, offersa fascinating recounting of the Ô¨Çybys.10The nucleus of Comet Halley appears to have two rotation periods (2.2 days and 7.4 days) corresponding tomotions about different axes of this irregularly shaped object.9

FIGURE 7The nucleus of Comet Halley as seen by the Giotto spacecraft. Evident are jets ofgases on the sunward side of the nucleus. (Image from Reitsema et al.,20th ESLAB Symp.,ESASP-250,Vol. II, 351, 1986.)It has been estimated that during the Ô¨Çybys, jets were present on 15% of the surface, with gasand dust discharge rates of approximately 2√ó104kg s‚àí1and 5√ó103kg s‚àí1, respectively.Because of the reaction forces produced by the jets, comets tend to have slightly erraticorbits.By considering these nongravitational perturbations to its orbit, the mass of CometHalley‚Äôs nucleus has been estimated at between 5√ó1013kg and 1014kg. If these crudeestimates turn out to be correct, the average density of the nucleus is less than 1000 kg m‚àí3and may be as low as 100 kg m‚àí3. It is likely that gases and dust escaping from the icybody have left a porous, honeycomb structure inside the nucleus with an average densityclosetothatofnew-fallensnow.(Jupiteralsoappeartohavebeenverylooselypacked,withdensitiesofabout600kgm‚àí3.)The passage of the International Cometary Explorer through the tail of Comet Giacobini‚ÄìZinner and the extensive international collaboration to rendezvous with Comet Halley werethe Ô¨Årst two of several missions to comets that have occurred since the mid-1980s. In 2001the experimental ion-propulsion spacecraftDeep Space 1obtained images of the 10-km-long nucleus of Comet Borrelly from a vantage point of 2200 km. In addition, on January 2,2004,Stardustpassed within 250 km of Comet Wild 2, obtaining high-resolution images ofthe surface. Stardust also captured dust from the comet and, on January 15, 2006, returnedthe dust to Earth for analysis.A very dramatic encounter occurred on July 4, 2005, whenDeep Impactsent a 370-kgimpactor into Comet Tempel 1, a 7.6 km by 4.9 km object, at a speed of 10.2k ms‚àí1.

carefully studying the comet from a low orbit around the nucleus. The mission will also landa probe on the surface of the comet. During its extended tour, Rosetta will Ô¨Çy alongside thecomet as it moves into the inner Solar System, is heated by the Sun, and begins releasingtrapped volatiles from its interior. Among other goals, this exhaustive study may help us todetermine whether or not the ‚Äúseeding‚Äù of Earth with cometary organic material may havehelped life develop on our planet.Sun-Grazing CometsWhile many comets that venture into the inner Solar System suffer relatively small amountsof sublimation near perihelion compared with their masses, other comets may experiencemore severe consequences. For instance, when Comet West moved through the inner SolarSystem in 1976, its nucleus broke into four separate pieces. Comet Kohoutek also split apartin 1974. Perhaps more impressive are theSun-grazing comets. While it has been intenselystudying the Sun, the LASCO instrument onboard the SOHO spacecraft has discoveredmore than 1000 comets that make close approaches to the Sun. In some instances thecomets‚Äô orbits cause them to plunge into the Sun, as occurred with Comet SOHO-6, shownin Fig. 9.The Oort CloudHalley is one example of a class of comets known asshort-period cometswith orbitalperiods of less than 200 years. Short-period comets are found near the ecliptic and return tothe inner Solar System repeatedly. Thelong-period cometshave orbital periods of greaterthan 200 years, and some may take from 100,000 to 1 million years or more to return.In 1950, based on a very careful statistical study of their apparently random orbits, JanOort (1900‚Äì1992) concluded that long-period comets originate in a distant distribution ofcometary nuclei now known as theOort cloud. Although the Oort cloud has never been

1012‚Äì1013members with a total mass on the order of 100 M‚äï. For comparison, the neareststars are approximately 275,000 AU away. The inner Oort cloud (3000 AU to 20,000 AU)may be slightly concentrated along the ecliptic, while the outer Oort cloud (20,000 AU to100,000 AU) has a nearly spherical distribution of cometary nuclei.The comets in the Oort cloud probably did not form at their present locations. Instead,they may be ancient planetesimals that coalesced near the ecliptic in the vicinity of Uranusand Neptune. After repeated gravitational interactions with the ice giants, the nuclei werecatapulted out to their current distances. Because these nuclei were so far from the Sun,passing stars and gas clouds ultimately randomized their orbits, resulting in the nearlyspherical distribution that exists in the outer cloud today. With the inner cloud being deeperin the Sun‚Äôs gravitational well, these cometary nuclei did not become quite as randomlydistributed. Therefore, comets in the inner Oort cloud were able to retain some history oftheir original locations when the Solar System was young. It is probably the gravitationalperturbations of other stars and gas clouds that cause some of the cometary nuclei to starttheir long falls into the inner Solar System.The Kuiper BeltSince the orbits of short-period comets lie preferentially near the ecliptic, it seems unlikelythat these objects originated in the Oort cloud. Kenneth E. Edgeworth (1880‚Äì1972) in 1949and Kuiper in 1951 independently proposed that a second collection of cometary nucleimight be located close to the plane of the ecliptic.In August 1992, 1992 QB1, a 23rd-magnitude object, was discovered by Jane Luu andDavid Jewitt 44 AU from the Sun and having an orbital period of 289 years. Seven monthslater a second 23rd-magnitude object (1993 FW) was discovered at nearly the same distancefrom the Sun.Assuming these objects have albedos characteristic of typical cometary nuclei(3% to 4%), then they must have diameters of approximately 200 km in order to appear asbright as they do. That would make them about one-tenth the size of Pluto. By early 2006,telescopic surveys employing sensitive CCD cameras had resulted in the discovery of morethan 900 similar objects beyond Neptune‚Äôs orbit.Now known as theKuiper belt,11this disk of cometary nuclei extends from 30 to 50 AUfrom the Sun; the semimajor axis of Neptune‚Äôs orbit is 30 AU. Some members appear tohave particularly eccentric orbits that may reach out to 1000 AU at aphelion, however.Noting their location beyond the outermost ice giant, theseKuiper Belt Objects(KBOs)are sometimes alternatively referred to asTrans-Neptunian Objects(TNOs).A Kuiper Belt Object Larger Than PlutoAs more and more KBOs have been discovered, a number of them have been found tohave diameters somewhat smaller than, but comparable to, that of Pluto (see Table 2).However, in 2005, astronomers Mike Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory),and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) announced the discovery of the Ô¨Årst object in the11In recognition of the independent suggestion of Edgeworth, this collection of objects is sometimes referred toas theEdgeworth‚ÄìKuiper belt.Minor Bodies of the Solar Systemobserved, its existence seems certain.

With an orbital period ofP=559 yr,a semimajor axis ofa=68 AU, an orbital eccentricity ofe=0.44, and an inclination withrespect to the ecliptic ofi=44‚ó¶, the orbital characteristics of 2003 UB313 are why it tookso long to Ô¨Ånd this large object in the Kuiper belt. Since most surveys looking for KBOshave been focused near the plane of the ecliptic, it was surprising to Ô¨Ånd 2003 UB313 withsuch a large inclination. HST observations indicate that the diameter of 2003 UB313 is2400 km, making it about 6% larger than Pluto. The spectrum of 2003 UB313, shown inFig. 10, is also strikingly similar to Pluto‚Äôs, suggesting a surface composition dominatedby frozen methane. A moon has been detected orbiting 2003 UB313 as well.The discovery of 2003 UB313 has rekindled the debate over what ofÔ¨Åcially constitutesa planet. Should 2003 UB313 be designated as a planet since it is larger than Pluto? ShouldPluto be removed from the planet classiÔ¨Åcation? Interestingly, prior to the discovery of largeKBOs, no formal scientiÔ¨Åc deÔ¨Ånition of a planet had ever been established; it had more orless been assumed that we will recognize a planet when we see one! At the time of writing,this is an issue that the International Astronomical Union is struggling to resolve. Giventhat society has long come to see Pluto as a planet, the decision may very well be beyondthe formal deÔ¨Ånitions of scientists. Whatever the resolution of these questions, it is clearthat in light of the apparent size and composition of 2003 UB313 and many of the otherKBOs, Pluto and Charon are certainly Kuiper belt objects; they just happen to be amongthe largest known members. After all, Pluto and Charon have more in common with verylarge cometary nuclei than with a ‚Äútypical‚Äù planet‚Äìmoon system. Neptune‚Äôs unusual moon,Triton, is probably a captured KBO as well.Classes of Kuiper Belt ObjectsAs the number of known KBOs has continued to grow, it has become evident that theyfall into three different groups based on their orbital characteristics.Classical KBOsareMinor Bodies of the Solar System

[Courtesy of Mike Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (GeminiObservatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University).]those that orbit between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun, most have semimajor axes between 42and 48 AU. The orbital inclinations of classical KBOs tend to be less than 30‚ó¶. It has beensuggested that the cutoff of classical KBOs at 50AU may be due to a passing star early in theformation of the Solar System.Scattered KBOshave much higher orbital eccentricitiesthan the classical KBOs and were probably pumped up to those orbits by gravitationalinteractions with the ice giants, most notably Neptune. 2003 UB313 is one example ofa scattered KBO. The perihelion distances of scattered KBOs are characteristically about35AU, and they tend to have greater orbital inclinations than the classical KBOs. In addition,it is likely that the scattered KBOs are at least one source of the short-period comets. Finally,a class ofresonant KBOsexists that have orbital resonances with Neptune. As we noted inSection 1, Pluto is locked in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune that protects it fromever colliding with the ice giant. As a result, Pluto (and Charon) are resonant KBOs. In fact,KBOs that have 3:2 orbital resonances with Neptune are referred to asPlutinos. Orbitalresonances of 4:3, 5:3, and 2:1 have been observed for KBOs as well.CentaursOther fairly large icy bodies have been discovered orbiting the Sun as well. In 1977, anobject known as 2060 Chiron was detected in an orbit that carries it from inside Saturn‚Äôsorbit out to the orbit of Uranus. Chiron‚Äôs diameter has been estimated to be between 200 kmand 370 km. A slightly smaller object, nicknamed ‚ÄúSon of Chiron‚Äù but ofÔ¨Åcially called5145 Pholus, has also been seen orbiting among the outer planets, between 8.7 and 32 AU.Originally classiÔ¨Åed as an asteroid, Chiron brightened unexpectedly in 1988 and developeda measurable coma.

water. It has been suggested that much of the water that is found in the oceans of Earth,that is trapped in the permafrost and ice caps of Mars, and that probably existed on Venusin the past could have been delivered to those worlds by impacting comets after the planetsformed. However, ‚Äúthe devil is in the details.‚Äù After careful examination of the compositionof several comets that have been explored by spacecraft, it has been noted that the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio in the comets exceeds that in Earth‚Äôs oceans by at least a factorof two. In fact, the D/H ratio is more characteristic of the interstellar medium than of theterrestrial oceans. From the small sample of comets that have been closely investigated todate, it appears that another source for the water in Earth‚Äôs oceans must be determined. Onthe other hand, it may be that the sample is biased, consisting only of objects that probablyderived from the Oort cloud, rather than the Kuiper belt. Of course, it is also possible thatthe delivery of water to Earth was a prolonged process, involving a variety of mechanisms,including comets, asteroids with relatively high water content (Section 3), water-richmeteorites (Section 4), and planetesimals.3ASTEROIDSit may be that the total number is in excess of 107.

FIGURE 13The distribution of 1796 asteroids in the asteroid belt. Asteroid group names andorbital resonances with Jupiter are also shown. Kirkwood gaps are evident at numerous resonancelocations, and enhancements in the number of asteroids are apparent at other resonance locations.(Data from Williams,Asteroids II, Binzel, Gehrels, and Matthews (eds.), University of Arizona Press,Tucson, 1989.)The Kirkwood Gaps in the Asteroid BeltThe distribution of asteroids in the belt is not completely uniform or even smoothly vary-ing with distance from the Sun. Instead, for various values of the orbital semimajor axis,asteroids are either conspicuously absent or overabundant (see Fig. 13). These positionscorrespond to orbital resonances with Jupiter, analogous to the resonances in Saturn‚Äôs ringsthat are produced by its moons, most notably Mimas. Regions where asteroids are under-abundant are known as theKirkwood gaps, the most prominent being at 3.3 AU (a 2:1resonance of orbital periods) and at 2.5 AU (a 3:1 resonance). In reality, physical gaps in thebelt, equivalent to gaps in Saturn‚Äôs rings such as the Cassini division, do not actually exist.Instead, the varying eccentricities and orbital inclinations of the asteroids tend to smearout the gaps somewhat, populating them with objects that are transients at those radii. Thelocations of the asteroids (and of some comets) on September 8, 2005, projected onto theplane of the ecliptic, are shown in Fig. 14.The Trojan AsteroidsIn some cases, resonances with Jupiter correspond to local increases in the number ofasteroids. A particularly interesting resonance group is theTrojan asteroids(1:1), whichoccupy the same orbit as Jupiter but either lead or trail the planet by 60‚ó¶, as illustrated inFig. 15 and evident in Figs. 11 and 14.

FIGURE 15Trojan asteroids are located in Jupiter‚Äôs orbit, either leading or trailing the planetby 60‚ó¶. The occupied positions are two of the Ô¨Åve Lagrangian points in the Sun‚ÄìJupiter system.although they can cross Earth‚Äôs orbit near aphelion. It appears that many of these objectswere probably main-belt asteroids at one time, but perturbations with Jupiter reorientedtheir orbits. Some of the Earth-crossing objects could also be extinct cometary nuclei thathave lost most of their volatiles after repeated trips near the Sun. Since the Apollo and Atenasteroids intersect Earth‚Äôs orbit, there is always the possibility that a collision could occur.Hirayama FamiliesIn 1918, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama (1874‚Äì1943) pointed out associ-ations of asteroids that occupy nearly identical orbits. Today, more than 100Hirayamafamilies(also known asasteroid families) have been identiÔ¨Åed. It is believed that eachfamily was once a single larger asteroid that suffered a catastrophic collision. With collisionspeeds that can reach 5 km s‚àí1, the available energy is more than enough to crush rock andcause pieces of the original asteroid to escape. If the collisional energy is not sufÔ¨Åcient,only a portion of the surface may escape, or, after fracture, the self-gravity of the debriscould cause the asteroid to reform again as a rubble pile. The InfraredAstronomical Satelliteobserved dust bands that seem to be associated with some of the major Hirayama families.Rendezvousing with AsteroidsThe Ô¨Årst asteroids to be visited by a spacecraft were 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida in 1991 and1993, respectively (Ida and its moon, Dactyl, are shown in Fig. 12). The Ô¨Çybys occurredas the Galileo spacecraft passed through the asteroid belt while on its trip to Jupiter. Justas astronomers had expected, the irregularly shaped asteroids show evidence of havingsustained numerous meteoritic impacts throughout their existence. In fact, the number ofimpacts suggests that Gaspra (a member of the Flora family) was probably broken off froma larger asteroid 200 million years ago. On the other hand, age estimates for Ida (a memberof the Koronis family) vary. Given the small size of Dactyl, it is unlikely that the mooncould have existed for more than 100 million years without getting destroyed by a majorcollision. However, based on the high crater density on Ida‚Äôs surface, it appears that Idamay be as old as 1 billion years. Assuming that the two objects were created together fromMinor Bodies of the Solar System

the breakup of a larger body, the resolution to the puzzle may rest with an increased rateof cratering from debris created when the larger object was destroyed. Even though thenumber density of asteroids in the belt is very low, the expected frequency of collisions issuch that very few would have been lucky enough to avoid a major impact sometime duringthe Solar System‚Äôs history.With the discovery of Dactyl orbiting Ida, it is possible to estimate the mass of Idafrom Kepler‚Äôs third law. Unfortunately, because of the high relative speed of the Ô¨Çyby(12.4k m s‚àí1) and the spacecraft‚Äôs trajectory relative to the orbit of Dactyl (the angle betweenthe trajectory and the orbit was about 8‚ó¶), only an approximate range of orbits were derivedfrom the data. The results suggest that the mass of Ida is approximately 3 to 4√ó1016kg,giving an average density of between 2200 and 2900 kg m‚àí3.TheNear Earth Asteroid Rendezvous mission(NEAR‚ÄìShoemaker)12was launchedin 1996. On its way to its ultimate destination of asteroid 433 Eros, NEAR‚ÄìShoemakeralso made a 10-km s‚àí1Ô¨Çyby of 253 Mathilde. Based on the gravitational perturbations ofMathilde on the spacecraft, it was determined that the average density of the asteroid isonly 1300 kg m‚àí3, indicating that this asteroid is likely a very heavily fractured rubble pilethat has been broken apart by multiple collisions and only loosely reassembled by its owngravity.When NEAR‚ÄìShoemaker arrived at 433 Eros on February 14, 2000, it entered into orbitaround the asteroid and began a year-long intensive study of the object (see Fig. 16).

(Courtesy ofNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.)During the orbital mission, the spacecraft studied Eros‚Äôs gravitational Ô¨Åeld and obtainedinformation about its surface composition. Although not designed as a lander, after one yearin orbit, NEAR‚ÄìShoemaker survived an intentional landing on the surface of the asteroid ata speed of about 1.6ms‚àí1, and was able to transmit information back to Earth for anotherweek. During the descent phase of the mission, NEAR‚ÄìShoemaker returned many close-upimages, including the one shown in Fig. 17.Measurements obtained during the mission indicate that the density of Eros is 2670kg m‚àí3and that it has probably been fractured, but not to the point of being a rubble pile likeMathilde. The interior of Eros appears to have a porosity of 25% or so. From measurementsof radioactivity and from gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements (see Fig. 18), it appearsthat Eros contains K, Th, U, Fe, O, Si, and Mg, as expected for this primitive object.Classes of AsteroidsIt was in the 1930s that astronomers Ô¨Årst realized that asteroids vary in color. By observingthe spectrum of reÔ¨Çected sunlight, it is possible to identify absorption bands that provideimportant information about the surface compositions of these objects. Information canalso be obtained by studying their albedos. The composition of asteroids is now knownto vary signiÔ¨Åcantly, but a general trend exists with increasing distance from the Sun (seeFig. 19). Some of the major classes of asteroids are‚Ä¢S-typeasteroids reside in the inner part of the belt (2‚Äì3.5 AU) and make up roughlyone-sixth of all the known asteroids. Their surfaces are dominated by a mixture ofiron- or magnesium-rich silicates, together with pure metallic iron‚Äìnickel. They tendto have a low abundance of volatiles, appear somewhat reddish, and have moderatealbedos (0.1‚Äì0.2). Gaspra, Ida, and Eros are S-type asteroids.Minor Bodies of the Solar System

‚Ä¢M-typeasteroids are very metal-rich with absorption spectra dominated by iron andnickel. They appear slightly reddish, and they have moderate albedos (0.10‚Äì0.18).M-types are preferentially located in the inner portion of the belt, among the S-types(2‚Äì3.5 AU).‚Ä¢C-typeasteroids constitute perhaps three-fourths of all the minor planets. Theseobjects are located predominantly near 3 AU but can be found throughout the mainbelt (2‚Äì4 AU). They are very dark, with albedos in the range 0.03‚Äì0.07, and theyappear to be rich in carbonaceous material. Two-thirds of the C-types also containsigniÔ¨Åcant quantities of volatiles, particularly water. Mathilde is a C-type asteroid.‚Ä¢P-typeasteroids are located near the outer edge of the main belt and beyond (3‚Äì5AU),peaking in population near 4 AU. They have a slightly reddish appearance and lowalbedos (0.02‚Äì0.06). Their surfaces may contain a signiÔ¨Åcant abundance of ancientorganic compounds, which are also present in comets.‚Ä¢D-typeasteroids are much like P-types, except that they have a redder appearanceand are located farther from the Sun. The Trojan asteroids are dominated by D-types.Some of Jupiter‚Äôs smaller moons also exhibit spectra similar to D-type asteroids.It seems likely that the differences in asteroid types with distance from the Sun arelargely a result of the process of condensation out of the solar nebula.ClosertotheSun,neartheinneredgeoftheasteroidbeltwherethetemperaturewashigher,morerefractorycompounds(likesilicon)condensedout while volatiles such as water and organic compounds could not. Farther from the Sun,temperatures had decreased sufÔ¨Åciently to allow more volatile compounds to condense andbecome part of the asteroids in that region. Many of the C-type asteroids in the middle ofthe belt appear to behydrated(meaning that water is present in these objects), whereas themore distant P- and D-types may contain water-ice, like most of the moons of the outerSolar System. Interestingly, 1 Ceres, at a distance from the Sun of 2.77 AU, and the largestasteroid in the belt, appears to be nearly spherical and may have a water-ice mantle.Evidently the majority of the minor planets in the inner part of the belt have beensubjected to signiÔ¨Åcant gravitational separation during their lifetimes, including most or allof the S-type asteroids. The unusual and very metal-rich M-types have also been profoundlyaltered by evolution since formation. It is generally believed that M‚Äôs represent the cores ofmuch larger parent asteroids that became chemically differentiated and were later shatteredby cataclysmic collisions, exposing the core.At least one asteroid, 4 Vesta, appears to have a surface that is covered with basalt (rockformed from lava Ô¨Çows). Vesta has a radius of 250 km and is the third-largest asteroidknown, behind 1 Ceres and 2 Pallas. It seems that magma developed in the interior andeventually found its way through cracks to the surface, where it solidiÔ¨Åed. Vesta also hasan impact crater large enough to have exposed the subsurface mantle.Internal HeatingAs Vesta and the S- and M-type asteroids suggest, the interiors of at least some asteroidsmust have become molten for a period of time during their lives, raising the question of theMinor Bodies of the Solar System

source of the heat. Being small objects, the asteroids readily radiate their interior heat intospace, so they should have cooled off rather quickly after formation, too quickly to allow forœÑ‚àù2613Al, with a half-life of 716,000 years:2613Al‚Üí2612Mg+e++ŒΩe.(5)One difÔ¨Åculty with this suggestion is that in order to be effective in melting the interiorof an asteroid, the aluminum must be incorporated relatively rapidly into a forming asteroidafter the aluminum is produced (in just a small number of half-lives). This places a severeconstraint on the formation timescale for the Solar System.A second problem with the radioactive isotope solution lies in the apparent trend fromchemically differentiated, volatile-poor asteroids in the inner belt to hydrated asteroidsaround 3.2 AU and icy bodies near Jupiter. This distribution seems to imply that2613Al waspreferentially included in asteroids in the inner belt if it is the source of heat that led tochemical differentiation.4METEORITESIn the early morning hours of February 8, 1969, residents in the region around ChihuahuaCity, Mexico, saw a bright blue-white light that streaked across the sky. As they watched,the light broke into two parts, each in turn exploding into a spectacular display of glowingfragments. Sonic booms were also heard accompanying the light show. It was reported thatsome observers even believed that the world was coming to an end. Rocks rained downon the countryside over an area that measured 50 km by 10 km (known as astrewnÔ¨Åeld).The next day the Ô¨Årst meteorite was discovered in the small village of Pueblito de Allende.All of the more than two tons of specimens collected from this meteor shower are nowcollectively referred to as theAllende meteorite. Many of the Allende stones were takento the NASA Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston, Texas, for study.13One sample ofthe Allende meteorite is shown in Fig. 20.14The observed streaks of light were produced by the frictional heating of the meteoritesurfaces by Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, causing the meteorites to glow. Although the outsides of thesamples were covered byfusion crustsproduced by the frictional heating, the interiors ofthe samples were unaffected. When a meteorite passes through the atmosphere, its damagedsurface Ô¨Çakes off almost as quickly as it forms.13The Lunar Receiving Laboratory was preparing to analyze the Moon rocks that were to be collected later thatyear by theApolloastronauts.14After attending a lecture about a meteoritic fall given by two Yale professors in Connecticut in 1807, PresidentThomas Jefferson (1743‚Äì1826) reportedly commented, ‚ÄúI could more easily believe that two Yankee professorscould lie than that stones could fall from Heaven.‚Äù Jefferson was, himself, a well-respected amateur scientist.Minor Bodies of the Solar SystemsigniÔ¨Åcant gravitational separation (recall that cool  R). Furthermore, the very long-half-life radioactive isotopes that are, in large part, responsible for maintaining the hot inte-rior of Earth could not generate heat rapidly enough to melt the interior of an asteroid. It has been suggested that a relatively short, intense burst of heat could be produced if a shorter-half-life isotope were available in sufÔ¨Åcient abundance. A likely candidate is

(b) A close-up of a portion of the interior of the sample showing CAIs and chondrules embedded in a matrix.(Courtesy of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.)The Age and Composition of the Allende MeteoriteA very precise chronometer for determining ages of events in the formation of the SolarSystem is available by comparing the relative abundances of two stable isotopes of leadthat can be identiÔ¨Åed in meteorites,20782Pb and20682Pb. These isotopes are ultimately producedby independent sequences of decays that begin with23592U (half-life of 0.704 Gyr) and23892U(half-life of 4.47 Gyr), respectively. By using thisPb‚ÄìPb system, scientists have deducedan age for the Allende meteorite of 4.566¬±0.002 Gyr, which is very close to the solarmodel age of the Sun (4.57 Gyr)It seems that the Allende meteoriteisanearlyprimordialremnantoftheearlysolarnebula(asareothermeteorites).A chemical analysis of the samples revealed that the meteorite‚Äôs composition is closeto solar (similar to the Sun‚Äôs photosphere), with some exceptions; the most volatile ele-ments (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Ar) are underabundant, and lithium (Li) was found to beoverabundant. The relative underabundance of volatiles can be understood by assumingthat the Allende meteorite condensed out of the inner portion of the solar nebula wherethe temperature was too high for those elements to be included in solar concentrations.1Allende‚Äôs lithium content is probably overabundant relative to the Sun because the Sun hasactually destroyed much of its own complement of that element during the star‚Äôs lifetime.CAIs and ChondrulesContained in the Allende samples are two types of nodules embedded in amatrixofdark silicate material. Thecalcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions(CAIs, also knownasrefractory inclusions) are small pockets of material ranging in size from microscopicto 10 cm in diameter that are relatively overabundant in calcium, aluminum, and titaniumwhen compared with the remainder of the meteorite. This is signiÔ¨Åcant because they are the15Of course, light gases such as hydrogen and helium easily escape low-mass objects such as meteorites.5Minor Bodies of the Solar System

most refractory (least volatile) of the primary elements in meteoritic material. It seems thatthe CAIs have undergone repeated episodes of evaporation and condensation.Chondrulesare spherical objects (1‚Äì5 mm across) made predominantly of SiO2, MgO, and FeO, whichseem to have cooled very rapidly from a molten state. Apparently no more than one meltingand cooling event occurred for a given chondrule, and some chondrules may have beenonly partially molten.A particularly intriguing discovery in the Allende CAIs is the overabundance of2612Mg.Because this particular nuclide is produced by the radioactive decay of2613Al (recall Eq. 5),which is known to be produced by supernovae, the meteorite may have formed out ofmaterial signiÔ¨Åcantly enriched with supernova ejecta. Moreover, because the half-life of2613Al is relatively short by astronomical timescales, the meteorite must have formed within afew million years or so following the production of the2613Al. This suggests that a supernovashock wave may have triggered the collapse of the solar nebula. Because the material fromthe supernova should not be expected to mix thoroughly with the original nebula, regionsof enhanced abundance would probably exist out of which objects such as the Allendemeteorite could form. An alternative mechanism for the production of the required2613Alhas also been proposed: Intense Ô¨Çares during pre-main-sequence T-Tauri and FU Orionisphases appear capable of synthesizing2613Al. This mechanism seems to eliminate the needfor a possibly ad hoc supernova trigger.Carbonaceous and Ordinary ChondritesThe Allende meteorite is one example of a class of primitive specimens known ascar-bonaceous chondrites, so named because they are rich in organic compounds and containchondrules. They may also include appreciable amounts of water in their silicate matrix.The matrix even records the existence of a fairly strong primordial magnetic Ô¨Åeld (aboutequal in strength to the value of Earth‚Äôs present-day Ô¨Åeld).Ordinary chondritescontainfewer volatile materials than the carbonaceous chondrites, implying that they formed in asomewhat warmer environment. Both general types of chondrites arechemically undiffer-entiated stony meteorites.Chemically Differentiated MeteoritesSeveral forms ofchemically differentiated meteoriteshave also been discovered. Igneousstones, known asachondrites, do not contain any inclusions or chondrules; instead, theywere formed entirely out of molten rock.Ironmeteorites do not contain any stony (silicate)material, but they may be composed of up to 20% nickel. About three-quarters of all ironmeteorites have long iron‚Äìnickel crystalline structures, up to several centimeters long andknown asWidmanst√§tten patterns, that could have developed only if the crystal cooledvery slowly over millions of years.16Stony‚Äìironmeteorites contain stony inclusions in amatrix of iron‚Äìnickel.Stones(chondrites and achondrites) make up about 96% of all themeteorites that hit Earth, irons account for about 3% of the total, and stony‚Äìirons make upthe remainder (1%).16The patterns were named for CountAlois von Widmanst√§tten, director of the Imperial Porcelain Works in Vienna,who discovered them in 1808.Minor Bodies of the Solar System

Sources of MeteoritesThe vast majority of all meteorites probably originate from asteroids, either chipped off theirparents or liberated from the deep interior during a catastrophic collision. For a sufÔ¨Åcientlylarge asteroid, signiÔ¨Åcant gravitational separation may have occurred, as suggested by theM-type minor planets. The exposed metallic cores are the source of the irons, and thecore‚Äìrock interface is the source of the stony‚Äìirons. Other asteroids underwent very littlechemical alteration during their lives and may account for the chondrites.The reÔ¨Çection spectra of asteroids can be compared with meteorite samples to test whetherthe asteroids could be the source of objects striking Earth. Figure 21 shows the strongcorrelations between the spectra of some asteroids and meteorites. Note, for instance, thatthe asteroid 176 Iduna has a spectrum very similar to that of the carbonaceous chondrite,Mighel, while the basaltic surface of 4Vesta agrees well with that of the achondrite meteorite,Kapoeta.An unusual achondrite was discovered on the ice cap of Antarctica in 1982.17It hasthe chemical makeup of rocks collected from the lunar highlands by theApolloastronauts.Clearly this achondrite was ejected from the Moon instead of from an asteroid. Becausethe escape velocity of the Moon is much larger than the escape velocities of asteroids, thediscovery was certainly unexpected. Even more surprising, a small handful of meteoriteshave been discovered whose ages date back only 1.3 Gyr. Because these stones are muchyounger than the surface of the Moon, they must have originated on a body that has been

The only real candidate is Mars, with an escape velocityof 5 km s‚àí1. At least one of the meteorites has inclusions of shock-melted glass that containnoble gases and nitrogen in the same proportions as the Martian atmosphere. However,also recall that Mars has produced at least one very old meteorite, ALH84001.A number ofmeteor showersoccur near the same dates every year, during which timemeteors seem to emanate from a Ô¨Åxed position on the celestial sphere, known as aradiant.The source of the meteorites is debris left in the orbits of comets or asteroids that happento intersect Earth‚Äôs orbit. As Earth passes through the body‚Äôs orbit, material rains down asif that material were coming from a position in the sky that Earth happens to be movingtoward at the time; hence the radiant. Most parent bodies of meteor showers are comets,although at least one object, 3200 Phaeton, is classiÔ¨Åed as an asteroid. Meteor showersare named for the constellation in which their radiants lie. A list of the principal meteorshowers, their approximate dates of maximum, and the parent object (if known) is given inTable 3.A History of Collisions with EarthBy now it should be apparent that objects throughout the Solar System have been subjectedto numerous and sometimes violent collisions; Earth is no exception. Even as recently as50,000 years ago, an iron meteorite, estimated to be 50 m in diameter, hit the ground inArizona, producing a crater 1.2 km wide and 200 m deep (Fig. 22). There is also strongevidence to support the hypothesis that a stony asteroid exploded in the atmosphere aboveSiberia in 1908 (an episode known as the Tunguska event). The detonation leveled treesin a radial pattern for 15 km in every direction. It is even reported that the blast waveknocked a man off his porch 60 km from the epicenter and that the explosion was audible atdistances of up to 1000 km. Estimates place the energy released during the Tunguska eventat 5√ó1017J, equivalent to a nuclear explosion of 12 MTons.Could other, even more energetic collisions have produced catastrophic consequencesfor life on Earth at the time?

(Courtesy of D. J. Roddy and K. Zeller, USGS.)could have been responsible for the mass extinctions of many species seen in the paleon-tological record. Support for this hypothesis came in 1979 when geologist Walter Alvarezand his father, Luis Alvarez (1911‚Äì1988), a Nobel Prize winner in physics, announced thediscovery of high abundances of iridium in a dark-colored clay that was located in the geo-logic strata at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary (commonly called the K‚ÄìT boundary). TheK‚ÄìT boundary corresponds in time to the extinction, 65 million years ago, of 70% of thespecies then in existence, including the last of the dinosaurs. Since their original discoveryin the Appenine Mountains of Italy, the anomalously high iridium concentrations have beenseen throughout the world at the K‚ÄìT boundary.The signiÔ¨Åcance of iridium is that it is rare in rock found near Earth‚Äôs surface. This isbecause iridium is readily soluble in molten iron (it is asiderophile) and as such participatedin the chemical differentiation of heavy elements sinking toward the core of Earth. However,iridium is fairly common in iron-rich meteorites. The amount of iridium present in the K‚ÄìTclay strata, where it is thousands of times more abundant than is typical of ordinary rock, isconsistent with an impact by a stony asteroid that measured 6 to 10 km across (or perhapsthe object was a slightly larger comet). An impactor of this size should have produced acrater some 100 to 200 km in diameter.Shocked mineral grains have also been found worldwide at the K‚ÄìT boundary but aremost abundant in North America, suggesting that the impact (or impacts) could have oc-curred there. Attention has focused on an ancient impact site along the northern coast ofthe Yucatan peninsula, near the town of Chicxulub. A nearly semicircular structure at least180 km across is located there and, based on radioactive dating, appears to be of the correctage. Based on the size of the crater, the energy of the impact is estimated to have been4√ó1022J, the equivalent of 1013tons of TNT.An impact of that magnitude at the Chicxulubsite could also account for evidence of an enormous tidal wave (atsunami) that apparentlytraveled as far north as central Texas.How could such an ocean impact have led to mass extinctions? If a meteorite of thesize suggested hit in the ocean, it would vaporize a large amount of water. Some of thisFor comparison, the vertical rise of a typical mountain in the Rockies is about 1.5 km above the valley Ô¨Çoor,and ocean depths are approximately 6 km.Some scientists have suggested that the diameter of the crater may be more like 300 km.18

water would wash out airborne dust while the rest of the moisture would increase thegreenhouse effect. As the temperature rose, even more water would evaporate into theatmosphere. Global atmospheric and ocean surface temperatures could rise by as much as10 K through this enhanced greenhouse effect.Alternatively, if a major impact were to occur on land, a tremendous amount of dustwould be injected into the atmosphere. As a consequence, the albedo would increase andmore solar radiation would be reÔ¨Çected back into space, cooling the surface.20In either case, as the meteorite passed through the atmosphere, the enormous amount ofkinetic energy available in the impactor would have produced searing heat and generateddevastating Ô¨Åres. It would also have reacted with appreciable amounts of nitrogen, producingnitrogen oxides and nitric acid. The ensuing acid rain would have damaged delicate land-based and aquatic ecosystems, killing vegetation and destroying much of the remainingfood source. Carbon soot is found in the K‚ÄìT clay layer, and there is also geologic evidencesuggesting that Ô¨Çowering plants were destroyed in some regions for periods of at leastseveral thousand years. Regardless of whether the impact occurred on land or in an ocean,the global environment would have been dramatically affected.Even if asteroids or comets did not kill the dinosaurs and other creatures, there is clearevidence that major impacts have occurred in the past. By some estimates, the probabilityof the occurrence, during our lifetimes, of a cataclysmic impact that would be capable ofdestroying civilizations is perhaps as high as one in a few thousand. In light of this rathersurprising statistic, some scientists have suggested that we should build a global asteroid‚Äìcomet defense system. Although no deÔ¨Ånite plans have yet been formulated, conferenceshave been held to discuss the possibility.The Basic Building Blocks of LifeIronically, even though impactors have been proposed as the mass murderers of some lifeforms on Earth, a number of carbonaceous chondrites have been found to contain many ofthe basic building blocks of life. Seventy-four amino acids have been found in one meteoritealone (the Murchison meteorite, which fell in Australia in 1972). Of those, seventeen areimportant in terrestrial biology. In addition to the amino acids, all four of the bases that cross-link the double helix of the DNA molecule (guanine, adenine, cytosine, and thymine), andthe Ô¨Åfth base that is important in cross-linking in RNA (uracil), have been discovered in theMurchison meteorite. Other molecules important to life on Earth (such as fatty acids) havealso been found in carbonaceous chondrites. Of course, it is a long way from producingrelatively simple amino acids and cross-linking bases to the generation of the extremelycomplex DNA and RNA molecules, but these discoveries indicate that the fundamentalchemistry necessary to start the process can occur in an extraterrestrial environment.
20It has been suggested that such a situation could also arise following a large-scale nuclear war. This scenariohas been referred to as ‚Äúnuclear winter.‚ÄùMinor Bodies of the Solar System

Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of theGeneva Observatory made the announcement in October 1995 of a planet with a period ofP=4.23077 d in a nearly circular orbit (e<0.01) around 51 Peg (a more recent radialvelocity curve of 51 Peg obtained by Geoffrey Marcy and his collaborators is shown inFig. 1).

With the rapid increase in the number of known planets beyond our own Solar System, important new information is being gathered concerning how planetary systems form and evolve. In addition to these systems being interesting to study in their own right, this increase in knowledge about extrasolar planets helps to inform us about our own Solar System.

An example of one suchsystem isœÖAndromedae; see Fig. 2. After the orbital perturbations due to the 4.6-d orbitof one planet were removed from the radial velocity curve of the star, evidence remainedof additional perturbations. TheœÖAnd system contains at least three planets with orbitalperiods of 4.6 d, 241 d, and 1284 d, withmsini‚Äôs of 0.69 MJ,1.89 MJ, and 3.75 MJ,respectively. The mass of the F8V parent star is estimated to be 1.3M‚äôAs of May 2006, 193 extrasolar planets have been detected in 165 planetary systems.While most of the planetary systems have had just one planet detected in them so far, 20systems are known to be multi-planet systems.

The data reveal the presence of atleast three planets orbitingœÖAnd. (Adapted from a Ô¨Ågure provided by Debra A. Fischer, privatecommunication.)The Mass Distribution of Extrasolar PlanetsInitially, the radial velocity technique was able to discover only very massive (Jupiter-class)planets in close-in orbits around their parent stars. One of the reasons for this selection effectis that these objects exert the greatest gravitational inÔ¨Çuence on their parent star and generatethe largest reÔ¨Çex radial velocities. The other reason is that a star must be observed over a timeinterval greater than the orbital period of the planet before the existence of the planet canbe conÔ¨Årmed. As the amount of time increases for the systems being surveyed, the longertime-line data have allowed researchers to Ô¨Ånd lower-mass planets and planets orbitingfarther from the star. The lowest-mass planet discovered to date is in a multiple systemorbiting Gliese 876 and has anmsini=0.023 MJ, which is just 7.3M‚äï. The largest orbitdetected thus far using the reÔ¨Çex motion technique is in the multiple system 55 Cancri, witha semimajor axis of 5.257 AU and an orbital period of 4517 d=12.37 yr.Over time, this selection effect is systematically diminishing.As is evident from statisticalstudies of the systems investigated so far, nature seems able to produce planets with a rangeof masses, with the lowest-mass planets being the most common. When binned by massinterval (see Fig. 3), the number of planets in each mass bin varies asdNdM‚àùM‚àí1.(1)The Distribution of Orbital EccentricitiesIt is also interesting to note the relationship between orbital eccentricity (e) and semimajoraxis for extrasolar planets (Fig. 4).

tend to have circularized orbits (or at least orbits with smaller eccentricities). Planets orbitingfarther from their parent star may have high orbital eccentricities, with the maximum valuedetermined to date being a planet orbiting HD 80606 withe=0.927 and a semimajor axisof 0.439 AU. However, from the data obtained thus far, only 15% of planets are knownto have eccentricities of greater than 0.5, and less than 2% have eccentricities in excess of0.75.With the small number of high-eccentricity planets, it is important to ask whether or notthere is something unique about the systems in which they are found. HD 80606 turns out tobe one member of a wide stellar binary system, the other member being HD 80607. Thesetwo G5V stars are nearly identical and slightly smaller than the Sun. The two stars are alsoseparated by a projected distance of 2000 AU. It has been suggested that the gravitationalperturbations exerted on the planet, HD 80606b, by HD 80607 may have pumped its orbitup to its current very high eccentricity. In support of this suggestion, another planet with ahigh eccentricity (e=0.67), 16 Cyg Bb, is also a member of a binary star system. However,the timescale for the gravitational perturbations provided by HD 80607 that would causethe orbital eccentricity of HD 80606b to signiÔ¨Åcantly increase is estimated to be 1 Gyr. Thislong period of time comes from the necessary resonant alignment of the second star withthe planet. The 1-Gyr timescale must be compared against the 1-Myr timescale providedby the general relativistic effect of the advance of the periastron of HD 80606b‚Äôs orbit dueto its parent starItisarguedthatthegeneralrelativisticeffectswouldcompletelyoverwhelmthe perturbations from HD 80607 unless there were a third body in the HD 80606 systemwith an orbital period of roughly 100 yr that could also gravitationally inÔ¨Çuence HD 80606b.So far, a third object has not been discovered.Two conclusions may be drawn from these data: (1) Planets with orbital periods ofless than 5 days tend to have the smallest eccentricities (e<0.17, with 80% of thosehavinge<0.1), probably due to strong tidal interactions with the parent star, and (2)planets sufÔ¨Åciently far from the parent star may have fairly large orbital eccentricities, buttypically less than about 0.5. It seems that our own Solar System is somewhat unique,at least compared to the systems studied to date, in that our planets tend to have orbitaleccentricities that are very small (excluding the Kuiper belt objects).The Trend toward High MetallicityAn additional important trend has also been emerging from the extrasolar planetary systemdata obtained to date. It appears that there is a strong tendency for planetary systems to pref-erentially form around metal-rich (Population I) stars. One way to quantify themetallicityis by comparing the ratios of iron to hydrogen in stars relative to our Sun, deÔ¨Åning themetallicity to be[Fe/H]‚â°log10/bracketleftbigg(NFe/NH)star(NFe/NH)‚äô/bracketrightbigg,(2)whereNFeandNHrepresent thenumberof iron and hydrogen atoms, respectively.

For comparison, extremely metal-poor (Population II) stars in the Milky WayGalaxy have been measured with values of[Fe/H]as low as‚àí5.4, while the highest valuesfor metal-rich stars are about 0.6.As can be seen in Fig. 5, most stars with planetary systems detected so far tend tobe metal-rich compared to the Sun. Those stars that do have a metallicity lower than thesolar value are only moderately lower. The data in Fig. 5 are plotted as the percentage ofstars in a given metallicity bin that were well studied and found to have planetary systems.According to the sample of 1040 F, G, and K stars used in the study, the data seem to bewell-Ô¨Åt by the relationshipP=0.03√ó102.0[Fe/H],(3)wherePis the probability of a star having a detectable planetary system.Measuring Radii and Densities Using Transitsthe small number of systems where this has been possible, it appears that the Jupiter-classplanets have densities that are similar to those of the gas giants in our Solar System (seeFig. 6). However, some of the so-called ‚Äúhot Jupiters‚Äù that orbit close to the parent starappear to be somewhat inÔ¨Çated (e.g., HD 209458b and OGLE-TR-10b). The simple answerto explain the effect, namely the higher surface temperature due to the planet‚Äôs proximityto the parent star, doesn‚Äôt seem to explain all of the close-in systems, so apparently anothersource (or sources) of heat is required to puff up the planets. Some of the suggestionsfor solving the puzzle include tidal dissipation due to ongoing circularization of the orbit(perhaps involving another undetected object trying to simultaneously pump up the orbitalFormation of Planetary Systems
The transit of a planet across the disk of the parent star provides further information about the planet. From the timing of the eclipse, and using atmospheric models of the star that include limb darkening, it is possible to determine the planet‚Äôs radius.

The star itself has a mass and radius of 1.3¬±0.1M‚äôand 1.45 R‚äô,respectively. In addition, the star‚Äôs metallicity is[Fe/H]=0.36, making it a signiÔ¨Åcantlymetal-rich star.

Ifthe core density is only 5500 kg m‚àí3, then the calculated core mass would be even larger(78 M‚äï).The Detection of an Extrasolar Planet AtmosphereTransits of extrasolar planets across the disks of their parent stars also provide for thepossibility of detecting extrasolar planetary atmospheres.

David Charbonneau and his collaborators were ableto detect the spectroscopic signature of sodium at its resonance doublet wavelength of589.3 nm by noting differences in the spectrum of the star as the planet passed in front ofit. The starlight passing through the planet‚Äôs atmosphere produced an enhanced absorptionfeature at that wavelength. The effect was very subtle, with deepening of the absorptionfeature by only an additional factor of 2.32¬±10‚àí4relative to adjacent wavelength bandsduring the transit. It has been proposed that the spectral signatures of water, methane, andcarbon monoxide may be able to be detected in this way as well.Distinguishing Extrasolar Planets from Brown DwarfsWith the detection of a few extrasolar planets having masses more than a factor of ten largerthan the mass of Jupiter, the question is again raised concerning the deÔ¨Ånition of a planet.At the low-mass end, large Kuiper belt objects such as Pluto have been classiÔ¨Åed as planets.At the upper end, what distinguishes a planet from a brown dwarf?planets. One proposed deÔ¨Ånition of planet is that it is an object that forms through a processbeginning with the bottom-up accretion of planetesimals, whereas a brown dwarf formsdirectly from gravitational collapse. The challenge with such a deÔ¨Ånition is determiningafter the fact how a particular object may have formed.A second criterion that has been proposed is based on whether or not the object thatforms is massive enough ever to have had nuclear fusion occur in its core. Computermodels of very low-mass objects indicate that if the mass of the object is greater than13 MJ, deuterium can burn while the object is forming. The rate of energy productionas being those objects having masses between these two limits (13 MJ<Mbd<75 MJ);in other words, brown dwarfs are ‚Äústars‚Äù that burn some deuterium but never reach astable nuclear-burning phase during contraction. Given the difÔ¨Åculty with the formation-mechanism criterion, the nuclear-reaction/mass-based criterion is generally favored.An Image of an Extrasolar PlanetIn 2004 the Ô¨Årst image of an extrasolar planet was obtained by Gael Chauvin and collabo-rators, using the European Southern Observatory‚Äôs Very Large Telescope with an infrareddetector; see Fig. 7. The parent star is a 25 MJbrown dwarf of spectral type M8.5, knownas 2MASSWJ1207334‚àí393254, or 2M1207 for short! The system was also resolved laterby the Hubble Space Telescope‚Äôs NICMOS instrument. The planet resides 55 AU from thebrown dwarf and has an estimated mass of 5¬±2MJ. From the infrared observations, thespectral type of the planet is between L5 and L9.5.Formation of Planetary Systems
Two different criteria have been proposed to answer this question. One suggestion is tied to the formation process of planets and stars. Stars form from the gravitational collapse of a gas cloud. As we will explore further in the next section, planets are gen-erally believed to form from a bottom-up accretion process, although there has been speculation that gravitational collapse in the star‚Äôs accretion disk may also produce
would not be sufÔ¨Åcient to stabilize the object during gravitational collapse, but deu-terium burning can be sufÔ¨Åcient to affect the luminosity of the object during col-lapse. At the ther end, stars with mass of at least 0.072 M‚äô (75 MJ) for solar compo-sition undergo nuclear fusion at a sufÔ¨Åcient rate to stabilize them at the low-mass end of the main sequence. Thus, it is proposed that brown dwarfs should be considered

In 1778 Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707‚Äì1788)proposed that a giant comet collided with the Sun, causing the ejection of a disk of materialthat ultimately condensed to form the planets. Competing tidal theories argued that a closeencounter with a passing star ripped material from the Sun. Unfortunately, each of thesetheories suffers from a number of difÔ¨Åculties, including inadequate energy, compositiondifferences between the planets and the Sun, and the sheer improbability of such an event.Another class of theories suggested that the Sun accreted planetary material from interstellarspace, taking care of the difÔ¨Åculty of composition differences between the Sun and theplanets, but not those among the planets themselves. Yet another class of theories, the basisof today‚Äôs models, argue for the simultaneous formation of the Sun and the planets outof the same nebula. Among the early proponents of these so-called nebular theories wereRen√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650), Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804), and Pierre-Simon, Marquis deLaplace (1749‚Äì1827).Although a signiÔ¨Åcant number of problems remain to be solved, there is now some senseof convergence on the basic components of planetary system formation. Throughout Part III(as well as in the rest of the book to this point), we have presented clues related to criticalfeatures of a comprehensive model, some obvious and others more subtle. Before discussingour present understanding of the formation of planetary systems, we will review some ofthese clues and the questions they raise.Accretion Disks and Debris Disksand pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. It is clear from both observational and theoreticalstudies that stars form from the gravitational collapse of clouds of gas and dust. If a collapsingcloud contains any angular momentum at all (which it surely will), the collapse leads to theformation of an accretion disk around the growing protostarAs a direct observational consequence of the conservation of angular momentum, nu-There is also substantial evidence ofdebris disksaround older stars, such asŒ≤PictorisTheimplicationisthatmaterialisleftoverinthediskafterthestarhasÔ¨Ånishedforming.

merous examples of accretion disk formation have been discovered and studied in detail, including the many proplyds observed in the Orion Nebula and elsewhere and the jets and Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects associated with young protostars. In addition, there is growing evi-dence that clumps of material exist in these disks.

Angular Momentum Distribution in the Solar SystemHowever, one problem that has frustrated most attempts to put together an adequate pictureof how our own Solar System developed concerns the present-daydistributionof its angularthe angular momentum of the entire Solar System, and most of the remainder is associatedwith Jupiter.1To complicate matters further, the Sun‚Äôs spin axis is tilted 7‚ó¶with respect tothe average angular momentum vector of the planets, making it hard to envision how sucha distribution of angular momentum could develop.An additional interesting component of the angular momentum question concerns theamount of angular momentum possessed by other stars. It turns out that, on average, main-sequence stars that are more massive rotate much more rapidly and contain more angularmomentum per unit mass than do less massive ones. Moreover, as can be seen in Fig. 8,a very discernible break occurs in the amount of angular momentum per unit mass as afunction of mass near spectral class A5. If the total angular momentum of the Solar Systemwere included, rather than just the angular momentum of the Sun, the trend along the upper

endofthemainsequencewouldextendtoincludeourSolarSystemaswell(theSun is a G2 star).A portion of the angular momentum problem may be solved by the transport of angu-lar momentum outward via plasma drag in a corotating magnetic Ô¨Åeld. Charged particlestrapped in the protosun‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld would have been dragged along as the Ô¨Åeld swept throughspace. In response, the protosun‚Äôs rotation speed slowed because of the torque exerted onit by the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines. In addition, much of the rotational angular momentum ofthe newly formed Sun was probably also carried away by the particles in the solar windComposition Trends throughout the Solar SystemWe have already seen that lower-mass stars with metallicities similar to or greater thanthe solar value seem able to form planetary systems routinely. Therefore, the process ofplanetary system formation must be robust. The process must also be capable of producingsystems with planets that are far from the parent star and systems where the planets are veryclose in.A crucial piece of any successful theory must be the ability to explain the clear composi-tion trends that exist among the planets in our Solar SystemThe inner terrestrial planets are small, generally volatile-poor, and dominated by rockymaterial, while the gas and ice giants contain an abundance of volatile material. Moreover,even though the ice giants Uranus and Neptune contain substantial volatiles, the gas gi-ants Jupiter and Saturn contain the overwhelming majority of volatile material in the SolarSystem.The moons of the giant planets also exhibit composition trends. In going from Jupiter outto Neptune, the progression is from rocky moons to increasingly icy bodies, Ô¨Årst containingwater-ice and then methane- and nitrogen-ice. The pattern even includes such objects as theasteroids, the Centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects, and other cometary nuclei. It is particularlyimportant to note that a composition trend also exists across the asteroid belt itself. Even onthe smaller scale of Jupiter‚Äôs system of satellites, the Galilean moons change from volcanicIo to the thick-ice surface of Callisto.The Temperature Gradient in the Solar NebulaApparently, either a composition gradient or a temperature gradient (or both) must haveexisted in the early solar nebula while these objects were forming. For instance, the ob-servations just described could be accounted for if the temperature of the nebular disk hadawell-determinedtemperaturegradient[T‚àùr‚àí3/4.

In support of these mechanisms is Fig.  8.

decreased sufÔ¨Åciently across the asteroid belt. In that case, water would not have condensed in the region of the terrestrial planets but could have condensed in the form of ice in the vicinity of the giant planets.

The temperaturestructure for an equilibrium solar nebula model is shown in Fig. 9. Even though speciÔ¨Åcfeatures of the distribution may change with more sophisticated modeling (by includingtime dependence, turbulence, and magnetic Ô¨Åelds), it seems apparent that the condensationtemperature of water-ice must be reached at some point near the current position of Jupiter,perhaps in the outer portions of the main asteroid belt (roughly 5 AU). The position in thesolar nebula where water-ice could form has been variously referred to as the ‚Äúsnow line,‚Äùthe ‚Äúice line,‚Äù or, more dramatically, the ‚Äùblizzard line.‚ÄùWe have also learned that the environments around newly forming stars can be verydynamic places, with mass accretion and mass loss happening at virtually the same timein T-Tauri systems. During FU Orionis events, the environment around the star can be-come particularly active, with signiÔ¨Åcant outbursts of energy occurring because of greatlyincreased mass accretion rates. It also seems certain that these environments will have com-plex magnetic Ô¨Åelds that would lead to frequent and intense Ô¨Çares, analogous to the solarÔ¨Çares on our Sun that are produced by magnetic Ô¨Åeld reconnection eventsConsequences of Heavy BombardmentOf course, it is readily apparent that our Solar System is riddled with evidence of colli-sions in the past, leaving cratered surfaces on objects of all sizes, from planets and moons.Formation of Planetary Systems
At least within our own Solar System, the formation of the Sun was accompanied by the formation of a wide range of objects, including small rocky planets, gas giants, ice giants, moons, rings, asteroids, comets, Kuiper belt objects, meteoroids, and dust.

to asteroids and comets. As a consequence, any formation theory must also be able to ac-count for the obvious, heavy bombardment endured by bodies in the early Solar System.composition of the Moon strongly suggest that both of these worlds were directly inÔ¨Çuencedby cataclysmic collisions involving very large planetesimals (the Moon‚Äôs formation is tiedto just such a collision with Earth). Heavy surface cratering shows that collisions continuedeven after their surfaces formed, with a brief episode of late heavy bombardment about700 Myr after the formation of the Moon. Features such as the enormous Herschel crateron Mimas and the bizarre surface of Miranda testify to the fact that the other bodies in theSolar System underwent the same intense barrage from planetesimals.Another consequence of the heavy bombardment by planetesimals is the variety ofpresent-day orientations for the spin axes of the planets. The extreme examples of theretrograde rotations of Uranus and Pluto have already been discussed, but the other planetsmust have had their rotation axes shifted as well. Assuming that the planets did form out ofa Ô¨Çattened nebular disk, the inherent angular momentum of the system would have resultedin rotation axes being initially aligned nearly perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Becausethis is not the case today, some event (or events) must have occurred to alter the directionsof the planets‚Äô rotational angular momentum vectors. With the exception of Venus‚Äôs andMars‚Äôs complex tidal interactions with the Sun and the other planets, the only likely mech-anism suggested to date that can naturally account for the range of orientations observedrequires collisions of planets or protoplanets with large planetesimals.The Distribution of Mass within Planetary SystemsOther features of the present-day Solar System that should be explained in a model of SolarSystem formation include the relatively small mass of Mars compared with its neighbors,the very small amount of mass present in the asteroid belt, and the existence of the Oortcloud and the Kuiper belt.Furthermore, if we are to seek a general, unifying model of planetary system formationthat includes our own Solar System as one example, it is necessary to understand thedistributions of planets in other systems. Particularly perplexing when Ô¨Årst discovered wasthe existence of ‚Äúhot Jupiters‚Äù such as 51 Peg b. How could a gas giant form and surviveso close to its parent star? In our own Solar System, none of the giant planets resides closerto the Sun than 5.2 AU.Formation TimescalesOne aspect of all formation theories that cannot be neglected are constraints imposed bytimescales:‚Ä¢Once thecollapseofamolecularcloudisinitiated,ontheorderof105yearsisrequiredfortheformationof a protosun and nebular disk.‚Ä¢ThehighmassdensityofMercuryandtheextremelyvolatile-poorFormation of Planetary Systems

nebular gas and dust that has not been accreted into a planetesimal or a protoplanet willbe swept away within about 10 Myr, terminating further formation of large planets.‚Ä¢ The presence of2613Al in carbonaceous chondrites indicates that these meteorites musthave been formed within a few million years after the creation of the aluminum,whether it was through a supernova detonation or through Ô¨Çares during FU Orionisactivity. Otherwise, all of the radioactive nuclides that were created would havedecayed into2612Mg. This observation puts severe constraints on condensation rates inthe early solar nebula.‚Ä¢ The oldest meteorites, including Allende, date back to near 4.566 Gyr, while the ageof the Sun itself is 4.57 Gyr. Clearly these oldest meteorites must have formed rapidlywithin the solar nebula.‚Ä¢ The ages of rocks returned from the Moon show that the surface of that body musthave solidiÔ¨Åed some 100 Myr after the collapse of the solar nebula. Similar constraintsexist on the formation of the surface of Mars judging on the basis of the age of theMartian meteorite, ALH84001.‚Ä¢ The lunar surface underwent a spike of late heavy bombardment about 700 Myr afterthe Moon formed.‚Ä¢ As we will learn later, as planets grow in accretion nebulae, they tend to migrateinward due to tidal interactions with the nebula and viscosity effects. It is estimatedthat a planetesimal could drift all the way into its parent star from a distance of 5 AUwithin roughly 1 to 10 Myr.‚Ä¢ Arather loose constraint on any model requires that all of the planets, moons, asteroids,Kuiper belt objects, and comets must be fully formed today, 4.57 Gyr years afterthe process started. Although this may seem trivial, not all models of Solar Systemformation have been successful in creating planets this rapidly!The Gravitational Instability Formation MechanismTwo general, competing mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of planets withinthe accretion disks of proto- and pre-main-sequence stars. One mechanism is based on theidea that planets (or perhaps brown dwarfs) could form in accretion disks in a manneranalogous to star formation. In regions where there may be a greater density of material inthe disk, self-collapse could result. As the mass accumulates in that region, its gravitationalinÔ¨Çuence on the surrounding disk increases, causing additional material to accrete onto thenewly forming planet. This mechanism could even result in a local subnebula accretiondisk forming around the protoplanet that could lead to the creation of moons and/or ringsystems.While this ‚Äútop-down‚Äùgravitational instabilitymechanism has several attractive fea-tures, including simplicity and being strongly analogous to the formation of protostars, itsgeneral applicability suffers from numerous difÔ¨Åculties. By observations of other accretiondisks, along with T-Tauri accretion and mass-loss rates, and combined with detailed numer-ical simulations, it appears that the solar nebula‚Äôs lifetime would not have been sufÔ¨Åcientto allow objects like Uranus and Neptune to grow quickly enough to attain the masses weFormation of Planetary Systems

observe before the nebula was depleted. This mechanism also does not explain the largenumber of other, smaller objects that are present in our Solar System and are likely to existin other planetary systems as well (recall theŒ≤Pic debris disk). In addition, the gravita-tional instability mechanism doesn‚Äôt appear to readily account for the mass distribution ofextrasolar planets, the correlation between planetary system formation and metallicity, orthe wide range in the densities and core sizes of planets, both within our Solar System andamong the extrasolar planets.The Accretion Formation MechanismAn alternative model, and the one general favored by most astronomers, is that planetsgrow from the ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù through a process ofaccretionof smaller building blocks.Based on all of the observational and theoretical information presently available, it appearsthat a reasonable description of the formation of planetary systems can now be given. Whatfollows is a possible scenario for the formation of our own Solar System, although referencesto general aspects of planetary system formation will also be made. It is important to note,however, that because of the complexity of the problem, revisions in the model (both minorand major) are likely to occur in the future.The Formation of the Solar System: An Exampleon the upper end of the main sequence, while less massive pieces either were still in theprocess of collapsing or had not yet started to collapse. Within a period of a few millionyears or less, the most massive stars would have lived out their entire lives and died inspectacular supernovae explosions.As the expanding nebulae from one or more of the supernovae traveled out through spaceat a velocity of roughly 0.1c, the gases cooled and became less dense. It may have beenduring this time that the most refractory elements began to condense out of the supernovaremnants, including calcium, aluminum, and titanium, the ingredients of the CAIs thatwould eventually be discovered in carbonaceous chondrites that would fall to Earth billionsof years later. When a supernova remnant encountered one of the cooler, denser componentsof the cloud that had not yet collapsed, the remnant began to break up into ‚ÄúÔ¨Ångers‚Äù of gasand dust that penetrated the nebula unevenly. The small cloud fragment would have also beencompressed by the shock wave of the high-speed supernova remnant when the expandingnebula collided with the cooler gas. It is possible that this compression may have evenhelped trigger the collapse of the small cloud. In any case, the material in the solar nebulawas now enriched with elements synthesized in the exploded star.Assuming that the solar nebula possessed some initial angular momentum, conserva-tion of angular momentum demands that the cloud ‚Äúspun up‚Äù as it collapsed, producinga protosun surrounded by a disk of gas and dust. In fact, the disk itself probably formedmore rapidly than the star did, causing much of the mass of the growing protosun to befunneled through the disk Ô¨Årst. Although this important point is not entirely resolved, it hasFormation of Planetary Systems

been estimated that the solar nebular disk may have contained a few hundredths of a solarmass of material, with the remaining 1 M‚äôof the nebula ending up in the protosun. At thevery least, a minimum amount of mass must have ended up in the nebular disk to form theplanets and other objects that exist today. Such a disk is referred to as theMinimum MassSolar NebulaThe Hill RadiusWithin the nebular disk, small grains with icy mantles were able to collide and stick togetherrandomly. When objects of appreciable size were able to develop in the disk, they began togravitationally inÔ¨Çuence other material in their areas.To quantify the inÔ¨Çuence that these growing planetesimals had, we can deÔ¨Åne theHillradius,RH, to be that distance from the planetesimal where the orbital period of a testparticle around the planetesimal is equal to the orbital period of the planetesimal aroundthe Sun.Assuming a circular orbit, the orbital period of a test particle (mt) around an object ofmassM(M‚â´mt) at a distanceRis given by Kepler‚Äôs third law asP‚âÉ2œÄ/radicalbiggR3GM.At a distanceafrom the Sun, the orbital period of the growing planetesimal around theSun equals the orbital period of a massless test particle around the planetesimal at the Hillradius when/radicalBigga3M‚äô=/radicalBiggR3HM.Thus, the Hill radius is given byRH=/parenleftbiggMM‚äô/parenrightbigg1/3a.(4)Rewriting in terms of the density of the Sun and the density of the planetesimal (assumedto be spherical), the Hill radius becomesRH=R/Œ±(5)whereRis the radius of planetesimal andŒ±‚â°/parenleftbiggœÅ‚äôœÅ/parenrightbigg1/3R‚äôa.The physical signiÔ¨Åcance of the Hill radius is that if a particle comes within about oneHill radius of a planetesimal with a relative velocity that is sufÔ¨Åciently low, the particle canbecome gravitationally bound to the planetesimal. In this way, the planetesimal acquires themass of the particle and continues to grow. Of course, as the planetesimal‚Äôs radius grows,so does its Hill radius..Formation of Planetary Systems

Example 2.1.For a planetesimal of densityœÅ=800 kg m‚àí3and radius 10 km, located5 AU from the Sun (œÅ‚äô=1410 kg m‚àí3), the planetesimal‚Äôs Hill radius would beRH=R/Œ±=R/parenleftbiggœÅœÅ‚äô/parenrightbigg1/3/parenleftbiggaR‚äô/parenrightbigg=8.9√ó106m=1.4R‚äï.This planetesimal is similar to present-day cometary nuclei.The Formation of the Gas and Ice GiantsAs the low-energy collisions continued, progressively larger planetesimals were able toform. In the innermost regions of the disk the accreting particles were composed of CAIs,silicates (some in the form of chondrules), iron, and nickel; relatively volatile materialswere unable to condense out of the nebula because of the high temperatures in that region.At distances greater than 5 AU from the growing protosun, just inside the present-day orbitof Jupiter, the nebula became sufÔ¨Åciently cool that water-ice could form as well. The resultwas that water-ice could also be included in the growing planetesimals beyond that distance.Even farther out (perhaps near 30 AU, the present-day orbit of Neptune), methane-ice alsoparticipated in the development of planetesimals. The location of the ‚Äúsnow line‚Äù wherewater-ice could form is shown in Fig. 10 (recall also Fig. 9).The object that grew most rapidly was Jupiter. Thanks to the presence of water-ice alongwith rocky materials, and with a nebula that was sufÔ¨Åciently dense in its region, Jupiter‚Äôscore reached a mass of between 10 and 15 M‚äï. At that point the planet‚Äôs gravitationalinÔ¨Çuence became great enough that it started to collect the gases in its vicinity (principallyhydrogen and helium). In effect, this created a localized subnebula, complete with its ownaccretion disk. The outcome was the formation of the massive planet we see today, togetherwith the Galilean satellites. Heat generated in the gravitational collapse of Jupiter, combinedwith tidal effects, led to the eventual evolution of its moons. Astronomers believe that theentire process of forming Jupiter required on the order of 106years, halting when the gaswas depleted.As we will see shortly, the formation of the massive Jupiter had a signiÔ¨Åcant impacton the other three planetesimals that had also grown to signiÔ¨Åcant size beyond the snow

line. Although Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all developed cores of 10 to 15 M‚äï, they weresomewhat farther out in the nebula where the density was lower. As a result, they wereunable to acquire the amount of gas that Jupiter captured in the same period of time.The Formation of the Terrestrial Planets and the AsteroidsIn the inner portion of the solar nebula the temperatures were too warm to allow the volatilesto condense out and participate in the formation of planetesimals. But as the nebula cooled,the most refractory elements were able to condense out to form the CAIs. Next to condensewere the silicates and other equally refractory materials.The slow relative velocities of silicate grains in nearly identical orbits resulted in low-energy collisions that promoted grain growth. Eventually, a hierarchy of planetesimal sizesdeveloped. Computer simulations suggest that in the region of the terrestrial planets, alongwith a large number of smaller objects, there may have been as many as 100 planetesimalsroughly the size of the Moon, 10 with masses comparable to Mercury‚Äôs, and several as largeas Mars. However, during the accretion process, most of these large planetesimals becameincorporated into Venus and Earth. When the forming planets became massive enough,internal heat that was generated by decaying radioactive isotopes, together with energyreleased during collisions, started the process of gravitational separation. The results werethe chemically differentiated worlds we see today.With the formation of the massive Jupiter just beyond 5 AU from the Sun, gravitationalperturbations began to inÔ¨Çuence the orbits of planetesimals in the region. In particular, mostof the objects in the present-day asteroid belt had their orbits ‚Äúpumped up‚Äù into progressivelymore and more eccentric orbits until some of them were absorbed by Jupiter or the otherdeveloping planets or were sent crashing into the Sun, while most were ejected from theSolar System entirely. This process stole material from the ‚Äúfeeding zones‚Äù near Mars and inthe asteroid belt, resulting in a smallish fourth planet and very little mass in the belt. Perhapsonly 3% of the original mass near Mars‚Äôs orbit remained and only 0.02% of the mass inthe region of the belt. Continued perturbations from Jupiter meant that the remaining beltof planetesimals had rather high relative velocities and were never able to consolidate intoa single object. In fact, the high relative velocities imply that collisions cause fracturing,rather than growth.As planetesimals continued to move throughout the forming Solar System, other colli-sions occurred. Some of the largest planetesimals in the inner Solar System collided withMercury, removing its low-density mantle, and some struck Earth, forming the Earth‚ÄìMoonsystem. Still other planetesimals of signiÔ¨Åcant mass crashed into Mars and the outer planets,changing the orientations of their axes. Apparently, some of the planetesimals were alsocaptured as moons or were torn apart by the giant planets when they wandered inside theplanets‚Äô Roche limits.Long before the terrestrial planets Ô¨Ånished ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù on planetesimals in their regions ofthe disk, however, the evolving Sun reached the stage of thermonuclear ignition in its core,initiating the T-Tauri phase. At this point the infall of material from the disk was reversedby the strong stellar wind that ensued, and any gases and dust that had not yet collected intoplanetesimals were driven out of the inner Solar System.It is only in the innermost part of the Solar System that the nebula was warm enough to form CAIs in the Ô¨Årstplace.2

The Process of MigrationThe accretion scenario described above is not without its own challenges. For instance,a long-standing problem has to do with the formation of the ice giants. At their currentpositions in the Solar System, it appears that the solar nebula would not have been denseenough to allow them to reach their present-day masses before the remaining gas was sweptaway by the T-Tauri wind. In addition, how is the episode of late heavy bombardment to beexplained as a spike in collision rates roughly 3.8 Gyr ago? The apparent solution to bothof these problems seems to lie in understanding a perplexing problem with many extrasolarplanets.With the discovery of ‚Äúhot Jupiters‚Äù in extrasolar planetary systems, scientists realizedthat planets must be able to migrate inward while they are forming, and Jupiter is no different.Computer simulations of Solar System evolution suggest that Jupiter formed about 0.5 AUfarther out in the nebula than its current position.One mechanism by which inward migration of Jupiter (and extrasolar planets) couldoccur involves gravitational torques between the planet and the disk. In this mechanism,initial deviations from axial symmetry produce density waves in the disk.The gravitational interaction between a growing planet and density waves results in thesimultaneous transfer of angular momentum outward and mass inward.This so-calledType Imigrationmechanism can be shown to be proportional to mass, implying that as the planetaccretes more material, it moves more rapidly toward its parent star. It may be that this canactually cause some planets to collide with the star on a timescale of one to ten millionyears.However, it initially appeared that the timescale for Type I migration was too shortcompared with the runaway accretion of gases onto the growing Jupiter; in other words,Jupiter would crash into the Sun before it could fully form. It also appeared that Jupitercouldn‚Äôt grow rapidly enough to reach its present size before the nebula was dissipated bythe T-Tauri wind.The solution to these problems may rest with the migration process itself. As the growingplanet moves through the solar nebula, it continually encounters fresh material to ‚Äúfeed on.‚ÄùIf the planet remained in a Ô¨Åxed orbit, it would quickly consume all of the available gaswithin several Hill radii and would grow only slowly after that. Migration allows it to movethrough the disk without creating a signiÔ¨Åcant gap in the nebula.It has also been shown that viscosity within the disk can cause objects to migrate inward.ThisType II migrationmechanism causes slowly orbiting particles farther out to speed upbecause of collisions with higher-velocity particles occupying slightly smaller orbits. Theloss of kinetic energy by the inner particles causes them to spiral inward. Type II migrationcan become the more signiÔ¨Åcant, if slower, migration process when a gap is opened up inthe disk.Peter Goldreich and Scott Tremaine suggested in 1980 that this mechanism would be important in the dynamicalevolution of accretion disks. Their paper was published some Ô¨Åfteen years before the Ô¨Årst conÔ¨Årmed detection ofan extrasolar planet.3

Outward migration is also possible. In this case, the scattering of planetesimals inwardresults in migration outward. Whether inward or outward migration occurs depends on thedensity of the nebula and the abundance of planetesimals.Applying the mechanisms of migration to the evolution of our own Solar System, itappears that Jupiter not only inÔ¨Çuenced objects interior to its present-day orbit but also wasinÔ¨Çuential in causing Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to migrate outward. It seems that Uranusand Neptune initially formed their cores in a region of the nebula with a greater density, justas Jupiter and Saturn did. However, because of outward migration, they were able to puton only a small amount of extra gas and remain today as ice giants, rather than gas giants.Resonance Effects in the Early Solar SystemAssuming that Jupiter originally formed at about 5.7 AU from the Sun as some simulationssuggest, and that Saturn formed perhaps 1 AU closer to the Sun than its current position, thetwo gas giants would have moved through a critical resonance as Jupiter migrated inwardand Saturn migrated outward. When the orbital periods of the two planets reached a 2:1resonance (i.e., the orbital period of Saturn was exactly twice the orbital period of Jupiter),their gravitational inÔ¨Çuences on other objects in the Solar System would have periodicallycombined at the same points in their orbits, causing signiÔ¨Åcant perturbations to orbits ofobjects in the asteroid belt and in the Kuiper belt. Computer simulations suggest that thisresonance effect may have occurred about 700 Myr after the formation of the inner planetsand our Moon. It seems plausible that the passage of Jupiter and Saturn through this 2:1resonance may have caused the episode of late heavy bombardment that is now recordedon the surface of the Moon.As a consequence of Neptune‚Äôs outward migration, Neptune swept up some of the re-maining planetesimals, trapping them in 3-to-2 orbital resonances with the planet as itmoved outward. It may be that Pluto and the other Plutinos were caught up in this outwardmigration. The orbits of the scattered Kuiper belt objects were also likely to have beenperturbed by the migration of Neptune. The classical KBOs were probably far enough fromNeptune not to be as drastically affected by its migration. In fact, the Kuiper belt may bethe Solar System‚Äôs analog to debris disks seen around other stars.Similarly, the Oort cloud cometary nuclei are likely to be planetesimals that were scat-tered more severely by Uranus and Neptune. Once sufÔ¨Åciently far from the Sun, scatteredcometary nuclei had their orbits randomized by passing stars and interstellar clouds.The Formation of CAIs and ChondrulesA particularly challenging problem with the model of Solar System formation describedabove is the presence of chondrules mixed in with CAIs in a matrix of hydrated and carbon-bearing minerals in chondritic meteorites. Both the chondrules and the CAIs have certainlybeen exposed to intense heat, but the matrix has clearly never been heated to temperaturesgreater than a few hundred kevins. Because silicates require lower temperatures to condenseout of the solar nebula, the chondrules probably formed after the CAIs. Silicate dust grainslikely formed out of the nebula, coalescing into small clumps through repeated collisions.Formation of Planetary Systems

(Figure adapted from Shu et al.,Ap.

As theinner edge of the accretion disk moves in and out on timescales of 30 years or so (perhapsassociated with magnetic Ô¨Åeld activity), the silicate grains are exposed to Ô¨Çash heating byÔ¨Çares resulting from reconnection events. In the rareÔ¨Åed environment at the interior edgeof the nebula, the droplets are able to cool rather quickly, perhaps between 100 and 2000 Kper hour. Frank Shu and his colleagues have suggested that the metamorphosed chondrulesmay be launched back into the planet-forming region of the nebula by an X-wind, similarto the wind responsible for the ejection of Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects in jets (see Fig. 11). Inthe planet-forming region of the nebula, the chondrules and CAIs are incorporated into thematrix. This model of chondrule formation implies that the solar nebula was a very dynamicsystem indeed.Although much work remains to be done in fully developing our understanding of SolarSystem formation and the formation extrasolar planetary systems, tremendous progress hasbeen made in this very complex area of research.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralBasri, Gibor, ‚ÄúA Decade of Brown Dwarfs,‚ÄùSky and Telescope,109, 34, May, 2005.Naeye, Robert, ‚ÄúPlanetary Harmony,‚ÄùSky and Telescope,109, 45, January, 2005.Marcy, Geoffrey, et al., ‚ÄúCalifornia and Carnegie Planet Search,‚Äùhttp://exoplanets.org.Schneider, Jean, ‚ÄúThe Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia,‚Äùhttp://exoplanet.eu.Formation of Planetary Systems

if the Milky Way is limited in extent, perhaps the diffuse and very faint ‚Äúelliptical nebulae‚Äùseen in the night sky might actually be extremely distant disk-like systems, similar to ourown but well beyond its boundary.1He called these objectsisland universes.Cataloging the Island UniversesThe true nature of the island universes became a matter of much investigation, and extensivecatalogs of these objects were collected. One such catalog we owe to Charles Messier (1730‚Äì1817), who, while hunting for comets, recorded 103 fuzzy objects that could otherwise beconfused with the intended targets of his search.2Although many of the members of theMessier catalogare truly gaseous nebulae contained within the Milky Way (such as theCrab supernova remnant and the Orion Nebula, M1 and M42, respectively), and others arestellar clusters (for instance, the Pleiades open cluster is M45 and the great globular clusterin Hercules is M13), the nature of other nebulae, such as M31 in Andromedawas unknown.Another catalog of nebulae was produced by William Herschel and subsequently ex-panded by his son, Sir John Herschel (1792‚Äì1871), to include the southern hemisphere.1Although today we generally use the wordnebulato refer to gas and dust clouds, it was originally used to describeany fuzzy patch of light in the sky that could not be resolved into a clear ensemble of stars.2Later, other astronomers added seven additional members to the original list, bringing the total number of Messierobjects to 110.It was in the middle of the eighteenth century that Kant and Wright Ô¨Årst suggested that the Milky Way represents a Ô¨Ånite-sized disk-like system of stars. In the two cen-turies of scientiÔ¨Åc investigation since their proposal, we have indeed come to learn that a major component of our Galaxy is well represented by a disk of stars that also contains a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of gas and dust. As an extension of their philo-sophical argument about the nature of the Galaxy, Kant went on to suggest that

Later, J. L. E. Dreyer (1852‚Äì1926) published theNew General Catalog(NGC), whichwas based on the work of the Herschels and contained almost 8000 objects. Like Messier‚Äôscatalog, the NGC includes many entries that are either gaseous nebulae or stellar clusterslocated within the Milky Way. However, the true nature of other objects in the catalogremained in question.3It was in 1845 that William Parsons, the third Earl of Rosse (1800‚Äì1867), built what wasthen the largest telescope in the world. Located in Ireland and nicknamed the ‚ÄúLeviathan,‚Äùthe 72-in (1.8-m) instrument was able to resolve, for the Ô¨Årst time, the spiral structure insome nebulae. Their pinwheel appearance strongly suggested that thesespiral nebulaemaybe rotating. This suspicion was eventually veriÔ¨Åed by Vesto M. Slipher (1875‚Äì1969) in1912 when he detected Doppler-shifted spectral lines in a number of these objects.The Great Shapley‚ÄìCurtis DebateThe argument over the nature of the nebulae centered on their distances from us and therelative size of the Galaxy. Many astronomers believed that the spiral nebulae resided withinthe conÔ¨Ånes of the Milky Way, and others favored the view that they were really Kant‚Äôsisland universes. On April 26, 1920, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington,D.C., Harlow Shapley of the Mount Wilson Observatory and Heber D. Curtis (1872‚Äì1932)of the Lick Observatory met to argue the merits of each point of view. In what has becomeknown as theGreat Debatein astronomy, Shapley supported the idea that the nebulae aremembers of our Galaxy. Curtis, on the other hand, was a proponent of the extragalacticinterpretation of the data, believing that the nebulae were physically much like the MilkyWay, but separated from it.One of Shapley‚Äôs strongest points was based on the apparent magnitudes of novae ob-served in M31. He argued that if the disk of Andromeda were as large as the Milky Way(approximately 100 kpc in diameter by his own recent estimates), then its angular size inthe sky (‚àº3‚ó¶√ó1‚ó¶) would imply a distance to the nebula that was so large as to make theluminosities of the novae in M31 much greater than those found in the Milky Way.His second major point was based on data of Adrian van Maanen (1884‚Äì1946), a well-respected observer, whose proper-motion measurements of M101 seemed to suggest anangular rotation rate of 0.02‚Ä≤‚Ä≤yr‚àí1. If M101 had a diameter similar to Shapley‚Äôs estimatefor the Milky Way, then points near its outer edge would have rotational speeds far in excessof those observed within the Milky Way.In defense of the extragalactic hypothesis, Curtis argued that the novae observed in spi-ral nebulae must be at least 150 kpc away from us in order to have intrinsic brightnessescomparable to those in the Milky Way. At this distance, M31 would be similar in size toKapteyn‚Äôs much smaller estimate of the diameter of the Galaxy, rather than to Shapley‚Äôs
3It is worth pointing out that most of the members in the Messier catalog are contained within the NGC; forinstance, M31 is also designated as NGC 224.The Nature of Galaxies
estimate. He also argued that the large radial velocities measured for many spi-ral nebulae seemed to indicate that they could not remain gravitationally bound within a Kapteyn-model Milky Way. Furthermore, assuming that the transverse  velocities of the nebulae are similar in value to their radial velocities, then if the neb-ulae were close enough to be located within the Milky Way it should be possible to

measure their proper motions across the sky; however, no such motions had been detected.Finally, for those spiral nebulae that are oriented edge-on, dark absorption regions can beseen. Curtis suggested that if the Milky Way had a similar dark layer, the zone of avoidancewould be easily explained.In the end, neither set of arguments proved to be deÔ¨Ånitive and the Great Debate servedmore to highlight the issues than to solve the dilemma. Although, as we now know, errorsexisted on both sides of the controversy, Shapley‚Äôs arguments were perhaps the more Ô¨Çawed.Part of the problem rested in his overestimate of the size of the Milky Way‚Äôs disk. The otherdifÔ¨Åculty was in his reliance on van Maanen‚Äôs data, which van Maanen himself later showedto be incorrect. In fact, proper-motion studies were unable to measure any rotation of M101.The debate was Ô¨Ånally settled in 1923 when Edwin Hubble (1889‚Äì1953) detectedCepheid variable stars in M31 using the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson. By measur-ing their apparent magnitudes and determining their absolute magnitudes via the period‚ÄìThe process of scientiÔ¨Åc exploration that led to the realization that our Solar System isnot located near the center of the Milky Way, and that the Galaxy is only one of a countlessnumber of galaxies in the universe, represented an advance in our understanding of the uni-verse comparable to that of the Copernican Revolution. Although many people contributedThe ClassiÔ¨Åcation of GalaxiesNow that the extragalactic nature of the galaxies had been established, work began ondetermining their physical properties. As a Ô¨Årst step in understanding any new collectionof objects, it is necessary to classify them according to their intrinsic characteristics, akinto the zoological classiÔ¨Åcation of various species of animals. Once again Hubble playeda key role. In his 1926 paper ‚ÄúExtra-Galactic Nebulae,‚Äù and later in his bookThe Realmof the Nebulae, Hubble proposed that galaxies be grouped into three primary categoriesbased on their overall appearance. This morphological classiÔ¨Åcation scheme, known as theHubble sequence, divides galaxies intoellipticals(E‚Äôs),spirals, andirregulars(Irr‚Äôs).The spirals are further subdivided into two parallel sequences, thenormalspirals(S‚Äôs), andthebarred spirals(SB‚Äôs). A transitional class of galaxies between ellipticals and spirals,known aslenticulars, can be either normal (S0‚Äôs) or barred (SB0‚Äôs). Hubble then arrangedhis morphological sequence in the form of atuning-fork diagram, shown in Fig. 1,which explicitly shows the two types of spirals. A galaxy‚ÄôsHubble typeis its designationalong the Hubble sequence.A more modern classiÔ¨Åcation designates true irregulars as Ir, as shown in Fig4

As a result, he referred to galaxies toward the leftof the diagram asearly typesand to those toward the right aslate types, terminology that isstill in widespread use today.Within the category of ellipticals, Hubble made divisions based on the observedellip-ticityof the galaxy, deÔ¨Åned byœµ‚â°1‚àíŒ≤/Œ±,(1)whereŒ±andŒ≤are theapparentmajor and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively, projectedonto the plane of the sky.

Galaxieswith ellipticities greater thanœµ=0.7 have never been observed, implying that no E galaxieswith intrinsic ellipticities greater than 0.7 appear to exist.It is important to realize that a difÔ¨Åculty immediately arises with this scheme: Theapparent ellipticity may not correspond well to an actual ellipticity since the orientationof the spheroid to our line of sight plays a crucial role in our observations. This effectcan be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, when observers viewoblateandprolategalaxies,respectively.

The galaxies with the most prominent bulges (the largest bulge-to-diskluminosity ratios,Lbulge/Ldisk‚àº0.3), the most tightly wound spiral arms (with pitch anglesof approximately 6‚ó¶), and the smoothest distribution of stars in the arms are classiÔ¨Åed as Sa‚Äôs(or SBa‚Äôs), while Sc‚Äôs (or SBc‚Äôs) have smaller bulge-to-disk ratios (Lbulge/Ldisk‚àº0.05),more loosely wound spiral arms (‚àº18‚ó¶), and spiral arms that resolve into clumps of starsand H II regions.

(Images from Sandage andBedke,The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D.C., 1994.)Hubble split the remaining category of irregulars into Irr I if there was at least some hintof an organized structure, such as spiral arms, and Irr II for the most extremely disorganizedstructures. Both the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud are examplesof Irr I galaxies, while M82 (NGC 3034) is an example of an Irr II; see Fig. 7.Irregular galaxies have a wide range of characteristics, although they tend not to beparticularly large. Typically their absoluteBmagnitudes vary from‚àí13 to‚àí20, they havemasses of between 108M‚äôand 1010M‚äô, and their diameters range from 1 to 10 kpc. Mostirregulars also tend to have noticeable bars that are often off-center.Since the publication of Hubble‚Äôs tuning-fork diagram, astronomers have made numerousmodiÔ¨Åcations to his original classiÔ¨Åcation scheme. For instance, Gerard de Vaucouleurssuggested the elimination of the irregular classiÔ¨Åcations, Irr I and Irr II, in favor of theaddition of other morphological classes later than Sc (or SBc). Those galaxies that werebinned into Irr I have been designated Sd (SBd), Sm (SBm), or Im (where m stands forMagellanic type); for instance, the LMC is classiÔ¨Åed as an SBm, and the SMC is an Im. Thetruly irregular galaxies are simply designated Ir, such as M82 (which is why Ir is used asthe designation in Fig. 1). Sandage and Brucato further suggested that the Ir class shouldmore appropriately be termedamorphousto indicate the lack of any organized structure.As we shall see, spirals of Hubble-type Sd and later tend to be signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller thanearlier-type spirals; consequently, they are sometimes referred to asdwarf spirals.The Nature of Galaxies

(Images from Sandage and Bedke,The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies, CarnegieInstitution of Washington, Washington, D.C., 1994.)Sidney van den Bergh introduced theluminosityclassfor spirals. The class ranges fromI through V , with I representing those spirals with well-deÔ¨Åned arms; galaxies with the leastdistinct arms are classiÔ¨Åed as V . M31 is classiÔ¨Åed as SbI‚ÄìII (intermediate between I andII), the Milky Way Galaxy is an SBbcI‚ÄìII, M101 is an ScI, the LMC is an SBmIII, andthe SMC is an ImIV‚ÄìV . Except for the largest elliptical galaxies (to be discussed further inSection 4), the Milky Way and M31 are among some of the largest and brightest galaxiesin the universe. It is important to note, however, that despite its name, luminosity class doesnot necessarily correlate well with absolute magnitude.Besides their striking arms, spirals also show an amazing array of more complex andsubtle features. While some galaxies have spiral arms that can be followed nearly all theway into the center, others have arms that appear to terminate at the location of an innerring. Special designations further help to classify these systems. M101 [Fig. 5(c)] is agalaxy of the former type and is labeled as an Sc(s)I, where (s) designates that the spiralcan be traced to the center of the galaxy. On the other hand, NGC 7096 [Fig. 5(a)] andM81 [Fig. 5(b)] are galaxies of the later type and are classiÔ¨Åed as Sa(r)I and Sb(r)I‚ÄìII,The Nature of Galaxies

Fortunately, the Hubble sequence, withits various permutations and enhancements, has greatly facilitated the process of trying tounderstand the nature of galaxies.2SPIRAL AND IRREGULAR GALAXIESHubble‚Äôs classiÔ¨Åcation scheme for late-type galaxies has proved to be very successful inorganizing our study of these objects. Not only do bulge-to-disk ratios, the tightness of thespiral arms, and the ability to resolve the arms into stars and H II regions all correlate wellwith Hubble type, but so do a host of other physical parameters.Tables 1 and 2 summarize the characteristics of late-type galaxies, the details ofwhich will be discussed later.

As is the case with determiningabsolute magnitudes for stars, calculating the absolute magnitudes of galaxies requires mak-ing corrections to their observed apparent magnitudes if we are to properly account for theeffects of extinction, both within the Milky Way and within the target galaxy(Extinction is generally negligible in the nearly empty space between galaxies.) Further-more, for extragalactic objects another important correction must be considered as well..The Nature of Galaxies

for very distant galaxies. If this effect were not considered, possible conclusions about theevolution of galaxies would be likely to be in errorThe Brightness of the Background SkyAnother problem that arises when making observations of faint galaxies, or when mea-suring their outermost regions, is the competition with the brightness of the backgroundsky. The dimly glowing night sky has an average surface brightness of about¬µsky=22B-mag arcsec‚àí2(measured in theBwavelength band). Sources of this backgroundlight include light pollution from nearby cities, photochemical reactions in Earth‚Äôs upperatmosphere, the zodiacal light, unresolved stars in the Milky Way, and unresolved galaxies.However, in modern photometric studies using CCDs, the surface brightnesses of galax-ies can be measured down to levels of 29B-mag arcsec‚àí2or fainter. Consequently, toaccurately determine the light distribution of a galaxy at these extremely faint levels, it isnecessary to subtract the contribution from the background sky.Isophotes and the de Vaucouleurs ProÔ¨ÅleOnce the sky subtraction is performed, it becomes possible to map contours of constantsurface brightness. Such contours are known asisophotes(lines of constant photon number).In specifying the ‚Äúradius‚Äù of a galaxy, it is necessary to deÔ¨Åne the surface brightness ofthe isophote being used to determine that radius.1/4ellipsoid having an isophotal surface brightness of¬µH=26.5B-mag arcsec‚àí2. A secondstandard radius in frequent use is theeffectiveradius,re, the projected radius within whichone-half of the galaxy‚Äôs light is emitted. The surface brightness level atre, designated¬µe,depends on the distribution of the surface brightness with radius.For the bulges of spiral galaxies, and for large ellipticals, the surface brightness distri-bution typically follows anr1/4law given by¬µ(r)=¬µe+8.3268/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggrre/parenrightbigg1/4‚àí1/bracketrightBigg.(2)This is just ther1/4de Vaucouleurs proÔ¨Åle written inunits of mag arcsec‚àí2, rather thanL‚äôpc‚àí2.

,The Nature of GalaxiesSince most galaxies are observed to have measurable redshifts, some or even most of the light that would normally fall within the wavelength band of interest, say the B band, would be redshifted to longer-wavelength regions. Accounting for this ef-fect is known as the K  -correction. As we will learn, the K  -correction is most severe

A direct means to determine the distribution of all matter, luminousand dark, is to measure the galaxy‚Äôs rotation curveExamples of rotation curves, averaged over groups of galaxiesof a givenMBrange and Hubble type, are shown in Fig. 8.When rotation curves are compared with either luminosity or Hubble type, a numberof correlations are found. For instance, with increasing luminosity in theBband,LB, therotation curves tend to rise more rapidly with distance from the center and peak at highermaximum velocities (Vmax). For galaxies of equalB-band luminosities, spirals of earliertype have larger values ofVmax. Within a given Hubble type, galaxies that are more luminoushave larger values ofVmax. Also, for a given value ofVmax, the rotation curves tend to riseslightly more rapidly with radius for galaxies of progressively earlier type. The fact thatgalaxies of different Hubble types, and therefore very different bulge-to-disk luminosityratios, exhibit rotation curves that are very similar in form if not in amplitude suggeststhat the shapes of their gravitational potentials do not necessarily follow the distribution ofluminous matter. This behavior is believed to be a signature of the existence of dark matterin these galaxies.Although the maximum rotational velocity within the disk increases for earlier-typegalaxies, a wide range inVmaxexists for each type. For typical samples of spirals oftype Sc and earlier, the mean maximum rotation velocities areVmax=299 km s‚àí1forSa, 222 km s‚àí1for Sb, and 175 km s‚àí1for Sc, while the ranges in values are 163 km s‚àí1to.

Astrophys.,223,81, 1991.)they measured the Doppler-broadened 21-cm radio emission line of neutral hydrogen ina sample of spiral galaxies. When the 21-cm line is sampled across the entire galaxy atone time, this line typically displays a double peak, as shown in Fig. 9. The doublepeak arises because of the Ô¨Çat rotation curve of the galaxy, which generally has the highestrotational velocity in the Ô¨Çat part of the curve. Since so much of the H I participates inthe rotation at this maximum velocity, the Ô¨Çux density is greatest at this value. The doublepeak occurs because a portion of the disk is rotating toward the observer, causing the lineto be blueshifted, and a portion of the disk is rotating away from the observer, resulting ina redshifted line.

Although the additive (zero-point) constant remains unevaluated, this simple argumentnearly reproduces the leading coefÔ¨Åcients of Eqs. ( 5‚Äì 8), the slopes of theB-bandTully‚ÄìFisher relations for Sa‚Äôs, Sb‚Äôs, and Sc‚Äôs, and the slope of the collective relationshipin theHband.Radius‚ÄìLuminosity RelationAnother important pattern also emerges in the data of early-type spiral galaxies (e.g., Sa‚ÄìSc): Radius increases with increasing luminosity, independent of Hubble type. At the diskradius (R25) corresponding to a surface-brightness level of 25B-mag arcsec‚àí2, the data arewell represented by the linear relationshiplog10R25=‚àí0.249MB‚àí4.00,(11)whereR25is measured in units of kpc.Masses and Mass-to-Light RatiosThrough the use of the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation (Eqs. 5‚Äì 7), combined with Eq. ( 11)and (24.49), it is now possible to estimate both the masses of early-type spiral galaxies andtheir mass-to-light ratios interior toR25. While masses range from greater than 109M‚äôtoat most about 1012M‚äô, there is only a very weak relationship between a galaxy‚Äôs massand its Hubble type (on average, Sc‚Äôs areslightlyless massive than Sa‚Äôs), as might beexpected, given the lack of any dependence on Hubble type in the correlation betweenR25andMB. However, a correlation does exist for the mass-to-light ratios, with the averagevalue ofM/LBdecreasing with progressively later Hubble type;‚ü®M/LB‚ü©=6.2¬±0.6 forSa‚Äôs, 4.5¬±0.4 for Sb‚Äôs, and 2.6¬±0.2 for Sc‚Äôs.Colors and the Abundance of Gas and DustThe trend inM/LBsuggests that Sc‚Äôs tend to have a greater fraction of massive main-sequence stars relative to earlier spiralswe should also expect Sc‚Äôs to be bluer than Sa‚Äôs and Sb‚Äôs, which is just what is observed.The mean values of the color index,B‚àíV, decrease with later Hubble types: 0.75 for Sa‚Äôs,0.64 for Sb‚Äôs, and 0.52 for Sc‚Äôs. For successively later-type galaxies, progressively greaterportions of the overall light from spirals is emitted in bluer wavelength regions, implyingan increasingly greater fraction of younger, more massive, main-sequence stars.Irregulars tend to be the bluest of all galaxies represented by the Hubble sequence, withcharacteristic values ofB‚àíV‚àº0.4. Furthermore, Ir‚Äôs often get bluer toward their centers,rather than redder as is the case for early-type spirals. This suggests that irregulars are stillactively manufacturing stars in their central regions. For instance, the LMC and the SMCstill appear to be making blue globular clusters in their disks.It is an unfortunate consequence of the historical development of the terminology that galaxies of later Hubbletype are actually dominated by stars lying on the early (upper) part of the main sequence.(that upper main-sequence stars have low mass-to-light ratios). If this is the case,8

Since blue main-sequence stars are short-lived, they must have formed relatively recently.Presumably an abundant supply of gas and dust exists in Sc‚Äôs from which these stars can beproduced. Based on the analysis of 21-cm radiation, HŒ±emission, and CO emission (whichis a good tracer of H2), we Ô¨Ånd that the mass fraction of gas relative to the total mass interiortoR25increases steadily from Sa‚Äôs to Sc‚Äôs and later. For instance,‚ü®Mgas/Mtotal‚ü©=0.04 forSa‚Äôs, 0.08 for Sb‚Äôs, 0.16 for Sc‚Äôs, and 0.25 for Scd‚Äôs. This agrees with the observation thatthe brightness of H II emission also increases with later Hubble types.The relative amounts of atomic and molecular hydrogen also change with Hubble type.For Sab‚Äôs,‚ü®MH2/MHI‚ü©=2.2¬±0.6, decreasing to 1.8¬±0.3 for Sb‚Äôs, 0.73¬±0.13 forSc‚Äôs, and 0.29¬±0.07 for Scd‚Äôs. This observation has been interpreted as implying thatSa‚Äôs are somewhat more centrally condensed, containing correspondingly deeper gravita-tional wells in which gas can collect and combine to form molecules. This means that theinterstellar medium of Sa‚Äôs is dominated by molecular gas while the interstellar mediumof Scd‚Äôs is primarily composed of atomic hydrogen. Overall, the amount of molecular hy-drogen in spirals can range from 5√ó1010M‚äôfor the most massive galaxies to as little as106M‚äôfor dwarf spirals. The mass of dust is characteristically 150 to 600 times lower thanthe mass of gas in the ISM.It is dust that is primarily responsible for the far-infrared (FIR) luminosities of galaxies,although synchrotron radiation and the emissions of stars can also contribute to the total.From observations made by IRAS, astronomers have discovered thatLFIR/LB=0.07 forM31 (an SbI‚ÄìII), 0.2 for M33 (an Sc(s)II‚ÄìII), 0.4 for M101 (an Sc(s)I), 0.18 for the LMC(an SBmIII), and 0.09 for the SMC (an ImIV‚ÄìV). In general, Sc‚Äôs have a larger fraction ofinfrared emission than Sa‚Äôs or Sb‚Äôs, consistent with the other observations of correspond-ingly greater fractions of their masses being in the form of gas and dust. Interestingly, SB‚Äôstend to have greater infrared luminosities than do normal S‚Äôs.Metallicity Gradients and Color Gradients of SpiralsNot only is there a dependence of color on Hubble type, but individual spiral galaxiesalso exhibitcolor gradients, with their bulges generally being redder than their disks.This arises for two reasons: metallicity gradients and star formation activity. The aver-age number of electrons per atom is larger for metal-rich stars than for metal-poor stars.Since ionization and the orbital transitions of electrons contribute to the opacity in stel-lar photospheres, the opacity in metal-rich stars is greater. Because it is more difÔ¨Åcult forlight generated in the interior to escape from a star with a higher-opacity photosphere,the star will tend to ‚Äúpuff up‚Äù; its radius will increase, with a corresponding decrease ineffective temperature. Hence, a higher-opacity star will be redder than a lower-opacitystar, all else being equalThe redness of bulges argues for those regions being more metal-rich than are the por-tions of disks farther from the center, as is the case in our own Galaxy. In fact, within theMilky Way, metallicity gradients have been measured at Galactocentric radii of between4 and 14 kpc with values ofd[He/H]/dr=‚àí0.01¬±0.008 dex kpc‚àí1,d[O/H]/dr=‚àí0.07¬±0.015 dex kpc‚àí1, andd[Fe/H]/dr=‚àí0.01 to‚àí0.05 dex kpc‚àí1.‚Äúdex‚Äù refers to the logarithmic nature of the metallicity term in the gradient99.The Nature of Galaxies

The symbolsin the upper panel correspond to dE‚Äôs (dwarf ellipticals, open squares) and ellipticals (open circles andopen triangles). In the lower panel, spirals are represented by Ô¨Ålled circles and irregulars are indicatedby Ô¨Ålled squares. (Figure adapted from Zaritsky, Kennicutt, and Huchra,Ap. J.,420, 87, 1994.)Star formation, the second major cause of color gradients, implies that the disks of spiralgalaxies are more actively involved in star-making than are their bulges. This is consistentwith the distribution of gas and dust in the galaxies. The spheroidal components of spiralsusually contain much less gas and have correspondingly lower star formation rates than theirdisks. Since disks are able to produce young, hot, blue stars at a greater rate, the spheroidsappear relatively redder and a color gradient is established.Color gradients have been observed within the spheroids of spiral galaxies as well, suchas NGC 7814. The galaxies‚Äô spheroidal components become bluer with increasing radius.This is also the case for the Milky Way, with the more metal-rich, redder globular clustersorbiting closer to the Galactic center.Observations indicate that metallicity correlates with the absolute magnitudes of galax-ies;[Fe/H]and[O/H]both increase withMB(see Fig. 12).

prisingly tight correlation exists between X-ray andB-band luminosities (LX/LB‚âÉ10‚àí7),which has been interpreted as implying that the X-rays are due to a class of objects thatconstitutes an approximately constant fraction of the population of all objects in spirals. Thesuspected sources are X-ray binaries. It is probable that supernova remnants also contributeto the X-ray emission.Supermassive Black HolesObservations of stellar and gas motions near the centers of some spirals strongly suggestthe presence of supermassive black holes.

It is important to note that in order to determine an accurate value for the mass, anappropriate choice ofRmust be made. As the observations move farther from the blackhole, contributions to the total mass increase from surrounding stars and gas.Rmust bechosen to be within the black hole‚Äôs ‚Äúsphere of inÔ¨Çuence.‚ÄùExample 2.1.Equation ( 13) can be used to estimate a virial mass for the centralblack hole of M32, a companion galaxy of M31. From Fig. 14, the central radial-velocitydispersion is approximately 162 km s‚àí1. This means that within 0.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(approximately 0.4 pc)of the center, there is a total mass of roughlyMvirial‚àº1√ó107M‚äô.A more accurate estimate, based on the rotation curve, gives a value of between 1.5√ó106M‚äôand 5√ó106M‚äô.It is important to note that central supermassive black holes are not restricted to late-typegalaxies. For example, based on observations made using the Hubble Space Telescope, itappears that the giant elliptical galaxy M87 (NGC 4476) also contains a 3.2¬±0.9√ó109M‚äôblack hole. HST was able to resolve a disk of material within M87 that has rotationalspeeds reaching 550 km s‚àí1; the disk itself is orbiting a central region no larger thanour Solar System. Given that the distance to M87 is nearly 20 Mpc, this is a remarkableobservation.

A veryintriguing and useful correlation has been discovered between the mass of the supermassiveblack hole in a galaxy‚Äôs center and the velocity dispersion of the stars within the galaxy.The relationship is illustrated in Fig. 15 and is given by the best-Ô¨Åt power law,Mbh=Œ±(œÉ/œÉ0)Œ≤,(14)whereœÉis the velocity dispersion in units of km s‚àí1,Œ±=(1.66¬±0.24)√ó108M‚äô,Œ≤=4.86¬±0.43, andœÉ0=200 km s‚àí1. The velocity dispersion is measured for the stellar pop-ulation near the black hole. Correlations between the mass of supermassive black holes andother bulk galaxy parameters, such as the luminosity of the bulge, have also been uncovered.Apparently a fundamental link exists between the formation of the central supermassiveblack hole in a galaxy and the overall formation of the galaxy itself. Just what that link isremains to be determined.Evidence continues to mount that supermassive black holes may exist in the centers ofmost galaxies.SpeciÔ¨Åc Frequency of Globular ClustersFinally, it is worth discussing the abundance of globular clusters in late-type galaxies,which, when compared with the numbers of globular clusters in ellipticals, has importantimplications for theories of galactic formation and evolution. It appears that galaxies thatThe Nature of Galaxies

3SPIRAL STRUCTUREGalaxies exhibit a rich variety of spiral structure, which may vary in number of arms andhow tightly wound they are, degree of smoothness in the distribution of stars and gas, surfacebrightness, and the existence or lack of bars. The most majestic spiral galaxies, known asgrand-designspirals, usually have two very symmetric and well-deÔ¨Åned arms. One of thebest-known examples of a grand-design spiral is M51 (NGC 5194), shown in Fig. 17.Also called the Whirlpool galaxy, M51 has a companion galaxy (NGC 5195, visible in theimage) near the end of one of the spiral arms.However, not all spirals are grand designs with two distinct arms. For instance, M101[Fig. 5(c)] has four arms, and NGC 2841 (Fig. 18) has a series of partial arm fragments.Galaxies like NGC 2841, which do not possess well-deÔ¨Åned spiral arms that are traceableover a signiÔ¨Åcant angular distance, are calledÔ¨Çocculent spirals. Only about 10% of allspirals are considered grand-design galaxies, another 60% are multiple-arm galaxies, andthe remaining 30% are Ô¨Çocculent galaxies.The optical images of spiral galaxies are dominated by their arms. This is because veryluminous O and B main-sequence stars and H II regions are found preferentially in thearms. Since massive OB stars are short-lived objects relative to the characteristic rotationperiod of a galaxy, spiral structure must correspond to regions of active star formation. (Forinstance, the ages of OB stars are on the order of 10 Myr, compared to 230 Myr for the orbitalperiod of the local standard of rest in the Milky Way

Noticethat the dust bands tend to reside on the inner (concave) edges of the arms. Observation of21-cm H I emission indicates that gas clouds are also more prevalent near the inner edgesof the arms.As Fig. 19 illustrates, when spiral galaxies are observed in red light, the arms becomemuch broader and less pronounced, although they still remain detectable.

Trailing structureLeading structureFIGURE 20Trailing and leading spiral arm structures.at red wavelengths emphasize the emission of long-lived, lower-mass main-sequence starsand red giants, this implies that the bulk of the disk is dominated by older stars. However,despite the dominance of lower-mass stars between the spiral arms, observations indicatethat there is still an increase in the number density of older stars (and an accompanyingincrease in mass density) within the spiral arms.Trailing and Leading Spiral ArmsAlthough the general appearance of spiral galaxies suggests that their arms aretrailing,meaning that the tips of the arms point in the opposite direction from the direction of rotation(see Fig. 20), verifying this is not always a simple matter. Distinguishing between trailingandleadingspiral arms requires a determination of the orientation of the plane of the galaxyrelative to our line of sight so that radial-velocity measurements can be unambiguouslyinterpreted in terms of the direction of galaxy rotation. In almost all cases where such aclear determination can be made, it does appear that spiral arms are trailing. However, in onecase, NGC 4622, two arms are going one way and another arm is winding in the oppositedirection; at least one of these arms must be leading. It has also been suggested that M31(Andromeda) has one tightly wound leading arm. In each case it is likely that the cause ofthe leading spiral is a tidal encounter with a retrograde-moving object (M32 in the case ofAndromeda).The Winding ProblemGiven that spiral galaxies are commonplace within the universe, it is natural to ask whatcauses spiral structure, and whether spiral arms are long-lived (with lifetimes comparableto the age of a galaxy) or transient.One problem immediately arises when the nature of spiral structure is considered;ma-terial armscomposed of a Ô¨Åxed set of identiÔ¨Åable stars and gas clouds would necessarily‚Äúwind up‚Äù on a timescale that is short compared to the age of the galaxy. This so-calledwindingproblemcan be understood by considering a set of stars that are originally along asingle line, but at varying distances from the center of the galaxy, as shown in Fig. 21(a).Since the disk of a spiral galaxy rotates differentially (except very near the center), the outerThe Nature of Galaxies

(a) The stars start out in a line at timet=0. (b) After starAhas completed one orbit.(c) After starAhas completed two orbits.stars will require more time to complete one orbit than will stars with smaller orbital radii.1This effect will of course lead to a natural generation of trailing spiral arms. However, afteronly a few orbits, the spiral arms will become too tightly wound to be observed; this situ-ation is depicted in Figs. 21(b) and 21(c). Another mechanism is needed to explainpersistent spiral structure.The Lin‚ÄìShu Density Wave TheoryIn the mid-1960s, the American astronomers C. C. Lin and Frank Shu proposed that spiralstructure arises because of the presence of long-livedquasistatic density waves. Densitywaves consist of regions in the galactic disk where the mass density is greater than average,perhaps by 10% to 20%. Stars, dust, and gas clouds move through the density waves duringtheir orbits around the galactic center, much like cars slowly working their way througha trafÔ¨Åc jam on a highway. Lin and Shu suggested that when the galaxy is viewed in anoninertial reference frame that is rotating with a speciÔ¨Åc angular speedŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp, known astheglobal pattern speed, the spiral wave pattern appears to be stationary, as shown inFig. 22. This does not imply that the motions of the stars are also stationary in thatframe, however. Stars near the center of the galaxy can have orbital periods that are shorterthan the density wave pattern (orŒ∫OmegaŒ∂>Œ∫OmegaŒ∂gp) and so they will overtake a spiral arm, movethrough it, and continue on until they encounter the next arm. Stars sufÔ¨Åciently far fromthe center of the galaxy will be moving more slowly than the density wave pattern and willbe overtaken by it (Œ∫OmegaŒ∂<Œ∫OmegaŒ∂gp). At a speciÔ¨Åc distance from the center, called thecorotationradius(Rc), the stars and density waves will move together. In this noninertial referenceframe in which the density wave pattern is static, the stars withR<Rcwill appear to passthrough the arms moving in one direction, while stars withR>Rcwill appear to be movingin the opposite sense.The Lin‚ÄìShu hypothesis helps to explain many of the observations concerning spiralstructure that have been discussed‚Äîfor instance, the ordering of H I clouds and dust bands1For Ô¨Çat rotation curves, the orbital velocities of stars are nearly independent of distance from the center, but theangular velocity,Œ∫OmegaŒ∂=v/R, still decreases with increasing distance.0

Becausemassive stars have relatively short lifetimes, they will die before they can move entirelyout of the density wave in which they were born. Less massive, redder stars will be ableto live much longer (some longer than the current age of the galaxy) and so will continuethrough the density wave and become distributed throughout the disk. Local maxima inthe number density of red dwarfs within spiral arms are due to the presence of the densitywave during a subsequent passage, which causes the stars to collect at the bottom of thewave‚Äôs gravitational potential well. Of course, the same scenario could also occur on theouter (leading) edges of spiral arms outside the corotation radius. However, it is likely thatless dust and gas will be found in these outer regions of the galaxy.In principle, the density wave theory also suggests a solution to the winding problem.The problem arose because we considered material arms (arms composed of a Ô¨Åxed set ofstars). If, instead, the stars are allowed to pass through a quasistatic density wave, then theproblem has been changed to one of establishing and maintaining the wave of enhanceddensity. This has been the focus of considerable research since the Lin‚ÄìShu hypothesis wasproposed.The Nature of Galaxies
Apparently, as dust and gas clouds within the corotation radius overtake a den-sity wave, they are compressed by the effects of the increase in local mass  density. This causes some of the clouds to satisfy the Jeans criterion and begin to collapse,  resulting in the formation of new stars. Since this process takes some time (approxi-mately 105 yr for a 15 M  star, the appearance of new stars will occur within the arm slightly ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù from dust and gas clouds at the edge of the wave.

Small-Amplitude Orbital PerturbationsWe now turn our attention to developing the basic ideas of how the orbital motions ofindividual stars about the galactic center can result in spiral-shaped regions of enhanceddensity according to the Lin‚ÄìShu hypothesis. We begin by considering the general motion ofa star (or gas cloud) in an axially symmetric gravitational Ô¨Åeld that is also symmetric aboutthe galactic midplane. This implies that we are assuming here that density waves make aninsigniÔ¨Åcant contribution to the gravitational Ô¨Åeld, an assumption that may not be valid inall spiral galaxies. However, the assumption does simplify the analysis considerably.From Fig. 23, the position of a star at some general point above the galactic midplanecan be written in the formr=RÀÜeR+zÀÜez,(16)whereÀÜeR,ÀÜeœÜ, andÀÜezare the unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates.1To convert betweenrectangular and cylindrical coordinates, we see thatx=RcosœÜ, y=RsinœÜ, z=z,andÀÜeR=ÀÜicosœÜ+ÀÜjsinœÜ,ÀÜeœÜ=‚àíÀÜisinœÜ+ÀÜjcosœÜ,ÀÜez=ÀÜk.For a star of massM, Newton‚Äôs second law of motion in cylindrical coordinates isMd2rdt2=Fg(R, z),

This implies that the star is able to move only along theR-axisin Fig. 24.

Sincethe force is always directed toward the position of minimumŒ∫PhiŒ∂eff, the star will acceleratetoward the bottom of the potential well, overshoot the equilibrium position, and climb backup the opposite side. The star will then turn around and fall back down toward the bottomof the well again, continually executing simple harmonic motion. The same type of be-havior would occur if the star were orbiting in a perfect circle projected onto the midplane(AR=0), but with superimposed vertical oscillations. However, since in generalŒ∫Ã∏=ŒΩandŒ∂Ã∏=0, the general motion within the well can be quite complicated, as Fig. 24 illustrates.We now have two expressions (Eqs. 34 and 35) that describe the motion of astar about an equilibrium position (R=Rm,z=0) that is moving in a circular orbit.

As the star moves ina retrograde direction about the epicycle, it is carried alternately closer to and then fartherfrom the galactic center. The epicycle is also oval in shape and has an axial ratio that isgiven by the ratios of the amplitudes of the oscillations inœáandœÅ,o r2Œ∫OmegaŒ∂/Œ∫. The(œá, œÅ)coordinate system of the epicycle rotates about the galaxy‚Äôs center with the angular speedŒ∫OmegaŒ∂(the angular speed of the equilibrium point) and is indicated in Fig. 25.Example .ur Sun is moving relative to the perfectlycircular motion of the LSR, as reÔ¨Çected in the Sun‚Äôs peculiar solar motion.

Using the values for the Oort constants A = 14.8 km s‚àí1 kpc‚àí1 and B = ‚àí12.4 km s‚àí1 kpc‚àí1, respectively, the epicycle frequency for our Sun is Œ∫0 = 36.7 kms‚àí1 kpc‚àí1 = 1.2 √ó 10‚àí15 rad s‚àí1.

The axial ratio of the Sun‚Äôs epicycle is given byœámaxœÅmax=2Œ∫OmegaŒ∂0Œ∫0‚âÉ1.5.Closed Orbits in Noninertial FramesThe number of oscillations per orbit about the galaxy‚Äôs center is equal to the ratio of thestar‚Äôs epicycle frequency to its orbital angular speed. If the ratioŒ∫/Œ∫OmegaŒ∂is a ratio of integers,the orbit is closed. Like the Sun‚Äôs, however, most stellar orbits are not closed and a rosettepattern results. But in a noninertial reference frame that is rotating with alocalangularpattern speed,Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂, relative to the inertial frame, the star‚Äôs path would appear to bevery simple, tracing out aclosed orbitthat is retrograde and centered at a distanceRmfromthe galaxy‚Äôs center (see Fig. 25). Such a reference frame corresponds to the epicycle‚Äôsown coordinate system in which the equilibrium point is stationary and the closed pathsimply traces the epicycle itself.To obtain a closed orbit in a noninertial reference frame, we need not necessarily choosean angular pattern speed that equals the unperturbed orbital angular speedŒ∫OmegaŒ∂. Instead, wecould choose to have the star completenorbits as seen in the rotating frame while executingmepicycle oscillations (wherenandmare positive or negative integers), after which timethe star would be back at its starting point. That is, we could choosem(Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚àíŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp)=nŒ∫,o rŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp(R)=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂(R)‚àínmŒ∫(R).(39)Note that this is a local pattern speed, soŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìpis a function ofR. Although in principle, thereare an inÔ¨Ånite number of local pattern speeds at eachR, only a small number of values fornandmproduce substantial enhancements in mass density.1Figure 26 shows the rotation of a coordinate system for which the local patternspeed corresponds to(n=1,m=2), together with the position of the star at one point.Figure 27 shows the motion of the star as seen in four rotating reference frames with(n, m)=(0,1),(1,2),(2,3), and(1,4). The position of the star that was indicated inFig. 26 corresponds to the same position in Fig. 27(a).Now imagine a large number of stars at various distancesRfrom the center of a spiralgalaxy, all observed in a reference frame rotating with theglobalangular pattern speedŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp.If we consider the case(n, m)=(1,2)andifthe local pattern speedŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂(R)‚àíŒ∫(R)/2is a constant for all values ofR, then we can setŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp. Seen from the noninertial frame,the resulting orbital patterns could be nested with their major axes aligned, as illustrated inFig. 28(a). The structure that results bears a signiÔ¨Åcant resemblance to the bars presentin roughly two-thirds of all spiral galaxies. Of course, we could also orient each successiveoval-shaped orbit so that its major axis is rotated slightly relative to the one immediatelyinterior to it. In this example the result is a trailing two-armed grand-design spiral wave1This problem is analogous to situations encountered within the Solar System. For example, the orbital resonancesof Saturn‚Äôs moons (primarily Mimas) with particles in the planet‚Äôs ring system produce gaps in the rings. In addition,small integer ratios between Jupiter‚Äôs orbital period and the orbital periods of asteroids result in either increasesor decreases in the number of asteroids having certain orbital radii.5

Twisting the ovals in the opposite sense would result in aleading two-armed spiral. The two-armed spiral M51 (Fig. 17) is an example of a trailing-arm,(n=1,m=2)pattern structure, while the four-armed spiral M101 [Fig. 5(c)] isan(n=1,m=4)system. Patterns withm=2 are the most common type of density wavestructure.It is important to remember that the individual stars are following their own orbits inan inertial reference frame and that these orbits appear only as simpliÔ¨Åed oval shapes in areference frame that is rotating with the local angular pattern speed. Furthermore, even inthe rotating frame the stars themselves are still moving along the oval orbits. Only the spiralpattern appears to be static in that frame (if we still assume thatŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp, independent ofR); in the nonrotating inertial frame the spiral pattern will appear to move with an angularspeed ofŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp. It is the ‚ÄútrafÔ¨Åc jam‚Äù of stars becoming packed together where their ovalorbits approach one another that leads to the density waves.The stability of the structures shown in Fig. 28 depends crucially on whetherŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂(R)‚àíŒ∫(R)/2 is actually independent ofR‚Äîthat is, on whether there is an appropriateglobal value ofŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp. Figure 29 shows curves ofŒ∫OmegaŒ∂(R)‚àínŒ∫(R)/mwith several ratiosofn/mfor one model of our Galaxy. Notice thatŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚àíŒ∫/2 is nearly Ô¨Çat over a wide rangeof values forR, a fact Ô¨Årst realized by the Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad (1895‚Äì1965). The same general behavior is exhibited by a large number of spiral galaxies andprobably accounts for the prevalence of two-armed spirals. Of course,Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚àíŒ∫/2i sn o texactly constant with respect to galactocentric radius, so some drifting of epicycle orbitsrelative to one another does occur, leading once again to a winding problem. However, inthis case the winding occurs for density waves rather than material waves, and because therelative drift is slower, the winding takes about Ô¨Åve times longer to develop. If a means canbe found to stabilize the galaxy against this remnant winding effect, the original Lin‚ÄìShuhypothesis of a quasistatic density wave will be realized.Lindblad, Corotation, and Ultraharmonic ResonancesSinceŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚àíŒ∫/2 is not exactly constant across the entire galactic disk, stars at varying radiido not encounter the spiral arms at precisely the same point in their epicyclic paths onThe Nature of Galaxies

However, there are certain radii for whichthis can happen and a resonance develops, analogous to the resonance that can occur when aspring is forced to oscillate at its natural frequency. For instance, if a star is at its maximumvalue ofœá(Eq. 36) each time it encounters a density wave, the perturbation it experiencesdue to the local increase in density and gravitational potential will always be in the samesense, and the effect will be cumulative. A similar argument applies to each of the localpattern speeds, such asŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂(R)andŒ∫OmegaŒ∂‚Ñìp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂(R)+Œ∫/2.This ampliÔ¨Åcation can occur at several radii in a galaxy, depending on its mass distributionand its resulting rotation curve.AninnerLindbladresonanceexists when the local angularpattern speed of the star equals the global angular pattern speed of the density wave for thecase whenŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚àíŒ∫/2 forn/m=1/2. It is possible that either zero, one, or two innerLindblad radii may exist for a given galaxy, depending on the shape of the rotation curve. Acorotation resonancecan occur ifŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂for some value ofR, and anouterLindbladresonancemight exist ifŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂+Œ∫/2. Theultraharmonicresonancemay also developforŒ∫OmegaŒ∂gp=Œ∫OmegaŒ∂‚àíŒ∫/4. The inner rings of galaxies such as NGC 7096 and M81 [Figs. 5(a)and (b)] are apparently due to either inner Lindblad resonances or ultraharmonic resonances,while the outer rings of galaxies like NGC 4340 [Fig. 4(f)] are found at the outer Lindbladresonance.The positions of the Lindblad and corotation resonances are depicted in Fig. 30for two different rotation curves.Resonances have the effect that epicycle oscillation amplitudes increase dramatically. Asa result, collisions of gas clouds should also increase signiÔ¨Åcantly at resonance positions,and energy will be dissipated. Consequently, resonance locations (if they exist in a speciÔ¨Åcgalaxy) can actually lead to damping of spiral waves unless other processes are capable ofNote that we are now going beyond the assumption made on page 969 that the density waves make an insigniÔ¨Åcantcontribution to the gravitational Ô¨Åeld.16

This situation is analogous to that of stellarpulsationregions of partial ionization (primarily hydrogen and helium) drivepulsations,while other regions of the star damp the oscillations.Nonlinear Effects in Density Wave TheoryDespite a great deal of work, a complete understanding of density waves has not yet beenfully realized. For instance, various effects not considered in the simple model presented heremay play important roles, such as nonlinear (higher-order) terms inŒ∫PhiŒ∂eff(recall Eq. 28).Also, the waves themselves alter the gravitational potential in which they originate so thatazimuthal symmetry breaks down.One important driving mechanism in a number of grand-design spirals, including M51(Fig. 17), is the presence of a companion galaxy that triggers spiral structure through tidal
NumericalN-Body SimulationsAn important example of a nonlinearN-body simulation of a rotating disk is one that wascalculated in an early work by F. Hohl in 1971 (see Fig. 31). In that calculation, 105stars were initially placed in axisymmetric orbits (t=0), but as the simulation progressed,Hohl‚Äôs model proved to be very unstable against the development of them=2 pattern (alsoknown as them=2 mode), and a two-armed spiral density wave developed (t=2.0).

A more detailed discussion of the physical driving mechanisms that help to establish and maintain density waves is beyond the level of the current discussion, but it is worth pointing out that the techniques for studying spiral density waves have much in common with the theoretical procedures used to investigate stellar pulsation; both linear and nonlinear models have been employed in the investigation of spiral structure.

Apparently a rotating disk is highly susceptible to a bar-mode instability, at least oncomputers.

In modernN-body simulations, models have also included the effects of highly cen-tralized masses, such as the gravitational inÔ¨Çuence of supermassive black holes. Variousresearchers have shown that the inclusion of sufÔ¨Åciently condensed and massive centralmass concentrations can weaken, and even destroy, the bar instability. Most studies Ô¨Åndthat a mass on the order of a few percent of the mass of the galaxy‚Äôs disk is required in orderto affect the bar.Stochastic, Self-Propagating Star FormationAlthough most of the discussion found in this section has focused on the Lin‚ÄìShu hypothesisof quasistatic density waves and the existence of grand-design spirals, many of the galaxiesobserved in the universe are Ô¨Çocculent spirals. It may be that these objects are composedof a linear combination of several stable density perturbations (somewhat reminiscent ofmodes in stellar oscillations), along with sufÔ¨Åcient patchiness in the interstellar medium togive the appearance of less well-deÔ¨Åned spirals. Alternatively, it may be that an entirelydifferent mechanism is responsible for the spiral structure seen in these galaxies.In 1976 M. W. Mueller and W. David Arnett proposed a theory of spiral structure forÔ¨Çocculent spirals known asstochastic,self-propagatingstarformation(SSPSF). In theirtheory they imagine spiral structure arising from outbursts of star formation that propagateacross the galaxy. When one region of the galaxy undergoes a star formation episode, itsmost massive stars will age rapidly, producing core-collapse supernovae. The supernovaeshock waves will travel through the interstellar medium, triggering the collapse of othergas clouds in nearby regions, where further star formation will occur, allowing the processto continue. This scheme has been compared to a forest Ô¨Åre, with the Ô¨Çames jumping fromtree to tree. Spiral structure arises when the differential rotation of the galaxy draws thesenewly ‚Äúlit‚Äù regions into trailing arms.Although SSPSF has been successful in producing Ô¨Çocculent spiral structure in computersimulations, it is unable to account for the transitions from dust lanes to OB stars to red starsacross the spiral arms of grand-design spirals, so it probably cannot explain those galaxies.Of course, it may well be that we will need both of these theories (and perhaps others) tounderstand the abundance of spiral structure found throughout the universe.4ELLIPTICAL GALAXIESAlthough Hubble type correlates well with a wide variety of physical parameters for late-type galaxies, thereby ensuring its continued usefulness for those systems, the Hubble-typedesignation for early galaxies (which is based solely on apparent ellipticity) has shownitself to be virtually irrelevant in terms of trying to categorize other characteristics. As aresult, subtype distinctions are made for ellipticals that are independent of the ellipticity,focusing instead on other morphological features, such as the size, absolute magnitude, andsurface brightness of the image. Once thought to be the simplest of the major galaxy types,since the 1980s ellipticals have come to be seen as remarkably diverse and complex.environmental evolution,possibly involving tidal interactions or mergers with neighboringgalaxies.Some of this complexity may arise, at least in part, from strongThe Nature of Galaxies

Morphological Classes of Elliptical GalaxiesToday a number of separate morphological classes are commonly used to distinguish amongthe elliptical galaxies:‚Ä¢cD galaxiesare immense, but rare, bright objects that sometimes measure nearly1 Mpc across and are usually found only near the centers of large, dense clusters ofgalaxies. Their absoluteBmagnitudes range from less than‚àí22 mag to‚àí25 mag,and they have masses of between 1013and 1014M‚äô. cD galaxies are characterizedby having central regions with high surface brightnesses (¬µ=18B-mag arcsec‚àí2)and very extended, diffuse envelopes (¬µ=26 to 27B-mag arcsec‚àí2). They mayalso possess tens of thousands of globular clusters, with typical speciÔ¨Åc frequencies,SN, of 15 (see Eq. 15). Furthermore, these galaxies are known to have very highmass-to-light ratios, sometimes exceeding 750 M‚äô/L‚äô, implying large quantities ofdark matter.‚Ä¢Normal elliptical galaxiesare centrally condensed objects with relatively highcentral surface brightnesses. They include the giant ellipticals (gE‚Äôs), intermediate-luminosity ellipticals (E‚Äôs), and compact ellipticals (cE‚Äôs). The absoluteBmagnitudesof normal E‚Äôs range from‚àí15 to‚àí23, masses of between 108and 1013M‚äô, diame-ters from less than 1 kpc to nearly 200 kpc, mass-to-light ratios from 7 to more than100 M‚äô/L‚äô, and speciÔ¨Åc frequencies of globular clusters in the range of 1 to 10.Lenticular galaxies (S0‚Äôs and SB0‚Äôs) are often grouped with normal E‚Äôs.‚Ä¢Dwarfellipticalgalaxies(dE‚Äôs) have surface brightnesses that tend to be much lowerthan those of cE‚Äôs of the same absolute magnitude. The absoluteBmagnitudes ofdE‚Äôs fall between‚àí13 and‚àí19, they have typical masses of 107to 109M‚äô, and theirdiameters are on the order of 1 to 10 kpc. Their metallicities also tend to be lowerthan for normal E‚Äôs. The average value of the speciÔ¨Åc frequency of globular clustersis‚ü®SN‚ü©=4.8¬±1.0, which is still higher than for spirals.‚Ä¢Dwarf spheroidal galaxies(dSph‚Äôs) are extremely low-luminosity, low-surface-brightness objects that have been detected only in the vicinity of the Milky Way.Their absoluteBmagnitudes are only‚àí8t o‚àí15 mag, their masses are roughly 107to 108M‚äô, and their diameters are between 0.1 and 0.5 kpc.‚Ä¢Blue compact dwarf galaxies(BCD‚Äôs) are small galaxies that are unusually blue,with color indices ranging from‚ü®B‚àíV‚ü©=0.0 to 0.3. This corresponds to main-sequence stars of spectral class A, indicating that these galaxies are undergoingparticularly vigorous star formation. They have absoluteBmagnitudes of‚àí14 to‚àí17, masses on the order of 109M‚äô, and diameters of less than 3 kpc. As is ex-pected for very active star formation, BCD‚Äôs also have a large abundance of gas, withMHI=108M‚äôandMHI I=106M‚äôconstituting roughly 15% to 20% of the entiremass of the galaxy. They also have correspondingly low mass-to-light ratios; in anextreme case, ESO400‚àíG43 hasM/LB=0.1 despite the dominance of dark matterat large radii.The Nature of Galaxies

Lentic-ular galaxies have also been included in the list, since they appear to have much in commonwith many ellipticals.Surface Brightness ProÔ¨ÅlescD‚Äôs and normal ellipticals have surface brightness proÔ¨Åles that closely follow ther1/4law(Eq. 2). As an example, the brightness proÔ¨Åle of NGC 3379, a gE galaxy, is shown inFig. 32. However, as the mass of the galaxy decreases, there is a fairly smooth transitionover to an exponential proÔ¨Åle (Eq. 3). This is particularly true of dE‚Äôs and dSph‚Äôs.Dust and Gas in Elliptical GalaxiesThe low gravitational binding energy of dE‚Äôs and dSph‚Äôs means that it would be very difÔ¨Åcultfor these galaxies to retain a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of gas, which is indeed what is observed.In fact, dSph‚Äôs are virtually devoid of gas. Consequently, dE‚Äôs and dSph‚Äôs are not activelyforming stars today. Moreover, they have very low metallicities, with values similar to thosefound in globular clusters. It has been suggested that these systems lost most of their gas viasupernova-driven mass loss or byram-pressure strippingas the galaxies passed throughthe gas found in clusters of galaxie .For many years it was believed that all elliptical galaxies had been largely strippedof any dust or gas that had not yet formed into stars or, alternatively, that star formationhad proceeded very efÔ¨Åciently during the earliest history of these galaxies, depleting allavailable gas. However, we have now come to realize that gas and dust are present withinmost normal elliptical galaxies, albeit at somewhat diminished levels relative to spirals.sThe Nature of Galaxies

Supp.,40,699, 1979.)The hydrogen gas that is present in E/S0‚Äôs is usually evident in several forms. A 107KX-ray-emitting hot-gas component of 108to 1010M‚äômakes up the majority of all the gasthat is present in a typical E/S0 galaxy. (Possible heating mechanisms include supernovaeand stellar winds.) A warm-gas component (104to 105M‚äôat 104K), observable in HŒ±,i salso present in the form of H II regions. Furthermore, 107to 109M‚äôof cold H I (‚àº102K) isdetectable at 21 cm. CO emission studies indicate that 107to 109M‚äôof molecular hydrogencan be found in early-type galaxies as well.Astronomers have also discovered that perhaps 50% of all elliptical galaxies containappreciable amounts of dust, with typical masses in the range of 105to 106M‚äô. One in-triguing observation is that there exist dust lanes that are essentially randomly oriented withrespect to their parent galaxy‚Äôs optical-light axes. Frequently, the dust is even found to becounter-rotating relative to the rotation direction of other (stellar) components. Apparently,much of this gas was acquired after the initial formation of the galaxy.Metallicity Gradients and Color GradientsAs we saw in Fig. 12 during our discussion of spirals, the metallicity of elliptical galaxiesis well correlated with luminosity; brighter galaxies have higher overall metal content.The Nature of Galaxies

Furthermore, as with spiral galaxies, metallicity gradients and color gradients also exist inellipticals. Generally, the central regions of E‚Äôs are redder and more metal-rich than areregions at larger radii. This trend can be expressed in terms of the gradient of the massfraction of metals found in the distribution of stars; typicallydlog10Z/dlog10r‚âà‚àí0.13.The same is also true for lenticular galaxies. In addition, the disks of S0‚Äôs are bluer thantheir bulges, as is the case for galaxies of later Hubble type [for S0‚Äôs,(U‚àíV)disk‚àí(U‚àíV)bulge‚àº‚àí0.1t o‚àí0.5]. Any successful theory of galaxy formation must incorporate theavailable observations concerning chemical enrichment.The Faber‚ÄìJackson RelationOne relationship that dE‚Äôs, dSph‚Äôs, normal E‚Äôs, and the bulges of spirals all have in commonis the correlation between their central radial-velocity dispersion andMB. This relationis shown in Fig. 33. To see why the relation arises, we begin with the result of thevirial theorem for the central radial-velocity dispersion of a spherically symmetric massdistribution (Eq. 13). In that case we made the simple approximation that a massMwas uniformly distributed throughout a volume of radiusR. Now, if we further assume thatthe mass-to-light ratio is essentially constant for all galaxies and that their average surfacebrightnesses are all equal (assumptions that were also made in ‚Äúderiving‚Äù the Tully‚ÄìFisherrelation), we arrive at the resultL‚àùœÉ40,(40)whereœÉrhas been replaced byœÉ0to signify that the central value for the radial-velocitydispersion is being assumed. This relationship was Ô¨Årst identiÔ¨Åed by Sandra Faber andRobert Jackson and is now referred to as theFaber‚ÄìJackson relation.

( 5‚Äì 7) if thoseexpressions are solved for log10Vmax.]The Fundamental PlaneAs is readily apparent by inspecting Fig. 33, there is considerable scatter in the data.This is further reÔ¨Çected in the fact that the slope of the best-Ô¨Åt line through the data differsslightly from the one found in Eq.

Depending on thesample set used,L‚àùœÉŒ±0, with 3<Œ±<5.In an effort to Ô¨Ånd a tighter Ô¨Åt to the data, astronomers have introduced a second parameterinto the expression, the effective radius. One representation of this Ô¨Åt isL‚àùœÉ2.650r0.65e.(42)Here, galaxies are visualized as residing on a two-dimensional ‚Äúsurface‚Äù in the three-dimensional ‚Äúspace‚Äù represented by the coordinatesL,œÉ0, andre. Known as thefun-damental plane, Eq. ( 42) combines the contributions of a galaxy‚Äôs gravitational well(œÉ0) with its radius and luminosity. Alternatively, the fundamental plane can be written interms of the effective surface brightness of a galaxy at its effective radius:re‚àùœÉ1.240I‚àí0.82e.(43)The fundamental plane appears to represent the whole family of elliptical galaxies andseems to imply something about the formation of these systems.The Effects of RotationParameterizations such as the fundamental plane do a much better job of classifying ellip-ticals than Hubble‚Äôs original scheme based on ellipticity. But then, what is the source of agalaxy‚Äôs shape? Although the answer is not yet entirely clear, it is evident that most ellip-ticals are not purely oblate or prolate rotators with two axes, but are triaxial, meaning thatthere is no single preferred axis of rotation. We have already encountered this situation inthe randomness of the dust lanes found in at least one-half of all ellipticals. Further evidenceexists in the frequent observations of counter-rotating stellar cores in as many as 25% oflarger ellipticals. It appears that in at least some of these cases, material in the form of gas,dust, globular clusters, or dwarf galaxies has been captured sometime since the galaxy‚Äôsformation.When the rotational velocities of elliptical galaxies are measured, we Ô¨Ånd that the moreluminous ones have mean rotational velocities that are much less than their velocity disper-sions, implying that the shapes of these galaxies are not due to rotation. Instead, their,The Nature of Galaxies

shapes are caused by the anisotropic velocity dispersion of stars in the galaxies. Inone particularly extreme case, the luminous E4 galaxy, NGC 1600 (MB=‚àí22.87), hasVrot=1.9¬±2.3k ms‚àí1andVrot/œÉ <0.013; it has no unique axis of rotation that is sta-tistically signiÔ¨Åcant.If the ellipticity,œµ(Eq. 1), of a galaxy were due to its being an ideal, oblate rotatorwith an isotropic stellar velocity distribution, then it can be shown that/parenleftbiggVrotœÉ/parenrightbiggisotropic‚âà/parenleftbiggœµ1‚àíœµ/parenrightbigg1/2.For NGC 1600 this means that if its ellipticity ofœµ=0.4 were due to pure rotation, thenVrot/œÉshould be approximately 0.8.

In addition, thediffuse, faint dwarf E‚Äôs have predominantly anisotropic velocity dispersions and are alsopressure-supported. On the other hand, galaxies for which‚àí18>MB>‚àí20.5 mag have‚ü®(V/œÉ)‚àó‚ü©‚âà0.9, implying that they are largely rotationally supported (this includes thecE‚Äôs). Interestingly, the bulges of spiral galaxies tend to be rotationally supported as well.Correlations with Boxiness or DiskinessIn 1988 Ralf Bender, Jean-Luc Nieto (1950‚Äì1992), and their collaborators proposed thatmany of the characteristics of elliptical galaxies can be understood in terms of the degreeofboxinessordiskinessthat their isophotal surfaces exhibit. As a means of quantifyingthe deviation from an elliptical shape, the shape of an isophotal contour (deÔ¨Åned for somespeciÔ¨Åc value of¬µ) is written in polar coordinates as a Fourier series of the forma(Œ∏)=a0+a2cos(2Œ∏)+a4cos(4Œ∏)+¬∑¬∑¬∑,(44)whereais the contour‚Äôs radius and the angleŒ∏is measured counterclockwise from the majoraxis of the ellipsoid. The Ô¨Årst term in the expansion represents the shape of a perfect circle,the second term corresponds to the amount of ellipticity, and the third term is associatedwith the degree of boxiness. Ifa4<0, the isophotal surface tends toward a ‚Äúboxy‚Äù ap-pearance, and ifa4>0, the surface tends toward being ‚Äúdisky‚Äù (see Fig. 34). Typically,|a4/a0|‚àº0.01, with deviations from perfect ellipses routinely measured to an accuracy ofapproximately 0.5%.Figure 35 shows the correlations of various quantities with the isophotal Fourierparametera4, measured in units of 100a4/a0.

galaxies are largely pressure-supported. The lower left-hand panel indicates the deviationof the core mass-to-light ratio (measured in theVband) from the average value for galaxiesof the same luminosity; boxy galaxies tend to have higher-than-average ratios, while diskygalaxies have lower-than-average values. The panel in the lower right-hand corner showsthat boxy ellipticals tend to be much brighter at radio wavelengths than are disky galaxies.However, the spread in the radio luminosities of boxy galaxies is quite large, while thevariation in radio luminosity for disky galaxies is much smaller. The same sort of correlationis found in other wavelength regions as well (such as X-ray, UV , and HŒ±). For disky E‚Äôs, thesources of X-rays tend to be consistent with compact sources only, as is the case for S0‚Äôs,while boxy E‚Äôs show evidence of diffuse sources (i.e., hot gas). Finally, the upper right-hand panel indicates that ellipticity (and therefore Hubble type) tends to increase with theabsolute value ofa4(|a4|). However, this suggests that two galaxies of identical Hubble typecould have very different characteristics when other physical parameters are considered. Forinstance, for two E4 galaxies (œµ=0.4), one could be rotationally supported (a4>0) whilethe other is pressure-supported (a4<0), and the former galaxy would probably have a coremass-to-light ratio lower than average while the latter galaxy would have a higher-than-average core mass-to-light ratio.Also, the former galaxy would have a low radio luminosity,and the latter might have a much higher radio luminosity.Other parameters also seem to be associated with the boxiness or diskiness of a galaxy.Whereas rotationally supported disky galaxies have relatively large ratios of rotational an-gular momentum to mass (speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum), pressure-supported boxy galaxieshave rather low ratios. Boxy galaxies are frequently observed to contain counter-rotatingcores, while disky galaxies rarely possess counter-rotating cores. Finally, disky galaxiesgenerally have rotational symmetries that are oblate, and boxy galaxies tend to be muchmore triaxial.Although it is likely that the degree of boxiness among galaxies represents a continuumrather than two distinctly different classes of objects, apparently some 90% of all ellipticalsare generally disky in nature. It has been suggested that disky galaxies may simply representan extension of the sequence of S0‚Äôs to progressively smaller and smaller disk-to-bulgeratios, and that some disky galaxies are actually misclassiÔ¨Åed S0‚Äôs. However, boxy galaxiesmay well represent a tell-tale signature of some level of environmental evolution, such astidal interactions or mergerThe Relative Numbers of Galaxies of Various Hubble TypesBefore leaving the discussion of morphology, it is important to address the question of therelative numbers of galaxies of various Hubble types. This is usually represented by theluminosityfunction,œÜ(M) dM, deÔ¨Åned to be the number of galaxies in a particular samplethat have absolute magnitudes betweenMandM+dM. Figure 36 shows luminosityfunctions for two samples; the top graph is for galaxies located in the vicinity of the MilkyWay and the bottom graph is for a sample of galaxies in the Virgo cluster of galaxies.The total luminosity function in either environment is the sum of theindividual luminosity functions of each Hubble type.In an attempt to Ô¨Ånd a general analytic Ô¨Åt to galactic luminosity functions, Paul Schechterproposed the functional formœÜ(L) dL‚àºLŒ±e‚àíL/L‚àódL,(45)s.The Nature of Galaxies

Instead, each luminosity function depends on the environment of theparticular sample of galaxies.As can be seen for either environment depicted in Fig. 36, dE‚Äôs and dwarf irregularsrepresent the largest fraction of all galaxies, even though S‚Äôs and E‚Äôs are the most prominentin terms of both cluster luminosity and mass. Careful inspection of the Ô¨Ågures also showsanother important detail: Although spirals represent the largest fraction of bright galaxies ineach case, there is a somewhat higher proportion of ellipticals in the Virgo cluster. When theVirgo cluster is compared with the much larger and more densely populated Coma cluster,the relative numbers of spirals and ellipticals change dramatically. In the Virgo cluster weÔ¨Ånd 12% E‚Äôs, 26% S0‚Äôs, and 62% S+Ir, while in the Coma cluster, the proportions are 44%E‚Äôs, 49% S0‚Äôs, and only 7% S+Ir.

In this chapter we will explore the complex system of stars, dust, gas, and dark matterknown as theMilky Way Galaxy.1Although it is possible to get at least a general ideaabout the nature of other galaxies from our external viewpoint, studying our own Galaxyhas proved to be very challenging. As we will learn, we live in a disk of stars, dust, and gasthat severely impacts our ability to ‚Äúsee‚Äù beyond our relative stellar neighborhood whenwe look along the plane of the disk. The problem is most severe when looking toward thecenter of the Galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius. In Section 1 we will discover thatstudying the distribution of stars while considering the effects of extinction provides us withour Ô¨Årst hint of what the Milky Way looks like from an outside perspective. In Section 2,a detailed description of the many varying components of the Galaxy will be presented.Much of what we know today about the formation and evolution of the Milky Way isencoded in the motions of the Galaxy‚Äôs constituents, especially when combined with infor-mation about variations in composition. Unfortunately, measuring the motions of the starsand gas in the Galaxy is done from an observing platform (Earth) that is itself undergoinga complex motion that involves the orbit of Earth around the Sun and the Sun‚Äôs elaboratepath around the Galaxy. In Section 3 we will investigate these motions, allowing us tomove from a description of motions relative to the Sun to motions relative to the center of1Throughout the remainder of this text, we may refer to the Milky Way Galaxy alternately in the shortened forms‚Äúthe Galaxy‚Äù and ‚Äúour Galaxy.‚ÄùHuman beings have long looked up at the heavens and contemplated its vastness, propos-ing various models to explain its form. In some civilizations the stars were believed to be located on a celestial sphere that rotated majestically above a Ô¨Åxed, central Earth.When Galileo made his Ô¨Årst telescopic observations of the night sky in 1610, we started down a long road that has dramatically expanded our view of the universe.

We will also be led to the remarkable conclusion that the luminous, baryonicmatter in the Galaxy is only a small fraction of what our Galaxy is composed of.Finally, in Section 4, we will probe the center of the Milky Way and study the exoticenvironment found there, including indisputable evidence for a supermassive black hole.Way. We will also study the large-scale structure of the universe and trace our developingunderstanding of the earliest moments of the universe and its ultimate fate.Historical Models of the Milky Way GalaxyAs can be seen by even a casual observation of the dark night sky, an almost continuousband of light appears to circle Earth, inclined about 60‚ó¶with respect to the celestial equator(see Fig. 1). It was Galileo who Ô¨Årst realized that this Milky Way is a vast collectionof individual stars. In the mid-1700s, in order to explain its circular distribution across theheavens, Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) and Thomas Wright (1711‚Äì1786) proposed that theGalaxy must be a stellar disk and that our Solar System is merely one component withinthat disk. Then, in the 1780s, William Herschel (1738‚Äì1822) produced a map of the MilkyWay based crudely on counting the numbers of stars that he could observe in 683 regionsof the sky (see Fig. 2). In his analysis of the data, Herschel assumed that (a) all stars

have approximately the same absolute magnitude, (b) the number density of stars in spaceis roughly constant, (c) there is nothing between the stars to obscure them, and (d) he couldsee to the edges of the stellar distribution. From his data, Herschel concluded that the Sunhad to be very near the center of the distribution and that the dimensions measured alongthe plane of the disk were some Ô¨Åve times greater than the disk‚Äôs vertical thickness.Jacobus C. Kapteyn (1851‚Äì1922) essentially conÔ¨Årmed Herschel‚Äôs model of the Galaxy,again using the technique of star counting. However, through the use of more quantitativemethods, Kapteyn was able to specify a distance scale for his model of the Galaxy. TheKapteyn universe, as it is now called, was a Ô¨Çattened spheroidal system with a steadily de-creasing stellar density with increasing distance from the center. A depiction of the Kapteynuniverse is shown in Fig. 3. In the plane of the Galaxy and at a distance of some 800 pcfrom the center, the number density of stars had decreased from its central value by a factorof two. On an axis passing through the center and perpendicular to the central plane, thenumber density decreased by 50% over a distance of only 150 pc. The number densitydiminished to 1% of its central value at distances of 8500 pc and 1700 pc in the plane andperpendicular to the plane, respectively. Kapteyn concluded that the Sun was located 38 pcnorth of the Galactic midplane and 650 pc from the center, measured along the Galacticmidplane.To get some idea of how Kapteyn arrived at his nearly heliocentric (or Sun-centered)model of the universe, recall the equation for the distance to a star whose absolute magnitudeis knownd=10(m‚àíM+5)/5.Assuming a value forM(for instance, if the spectral class and luminosity class are known),and measuringmat a telescope, the distance modulusm‚àíMand the distancedare readilyobtained. And given the known coordinates of the star on the celestial sphere, its three-dimensional position relative to Earth is determined.In actuality, since the number of stars in any given region is so great, it is impractical toestimate the distance to each individual star in the way just described. Instead, a statisticalapproach is used that is based on counting the number of stars in a speciÔ¨Åed region downto a predetermined limiting apparent magnitude. From this counting procedure, the numberdensity of stars at a given distance from the Sun can be estimated. We will discuss some
FIGURE 3The Kapteyn universe. Surfaces of constant stellar number density are indicatedaround the Galactic center. Note that the open circle does not represent the position of the Sun derivedby Kapteyn. Rather, the open circle was used as an estimate from which Kapteyn began his analysisof the available data.

of the details of this method shortly. In his original study, Kapteyn used over 200 selectedregions of the sky.During the years between 1915 and 1919, shortly before Kapteyn‚Äôs model was published,Harlow Shapley (1885‚Äì1972) estimated the distances to 93 globular clusters using RR LyraeIn analyzing his data, Shapley recognized that the globular clusters are not distributeduniformly throughout space but are found preferentially in a region of the sky that is centeredin the constellation of Sagittarius, at a distance that he determined to be 15 kpc from theSun. Furthermore, he estimated that the most distant clusters are more than 70 kpc from theSun, over 55 kpc beyond the center. As a result, by assuming that the extent of the globularclusters was the same as the rest of the Galaxy, Shapley believed that the diameter of theGalaxy was on the order of 100 kpc, close to ten times the value proposed by Kapteyn.Shapley‚Äôs picture of the Galaxy also differed from Kapteyn‚Äôs in another important way:Kapteyn‚Äôs model located the Sun relatively near the center of the distribution of stars,whereas Shapley‚Äôs Galactic center was much farther away.We know today that both Kapteyn and Shapley were in error; Kapteyn‚Äôs universe wastoo small and the Sun was too near the center, and Shapley‚Äôs Galactic model was toolarge. Surprisingly, both models erred in part for the same reason: the failure to include intheir distance estimates the effects of interstellar extinction due to dust and gas. Kapteyn‚Äôsselected regions were largely within the Galactic disk where extinction effects are mostsevere; as a result, he was unable to see the most distant portions of the Milky Way, causinghim to underestimate its size. The problem is analogous to someone on Earth trying tosee the surrounding land while standing in a dense fog with limited visibility. Shapley, onthe other hand, chose to study objects that are generally found well above and below theplane of the Milky Way and that are inherently bright, making them visible from greatdistances. It is in directions perpendicular to the disk that interstellar extinction is leastimportant, although it cannot be neglected entirely. Unfortunately, errors in the calibrationof the period‚Äìluminosity relation used by Shapley led to overestimates of the distances tothe clusters. The calibration errors were traced to the effects of interstellar extinctionInterestingly, Kapteyn was aware of the errors that interstellar extinction could introduce,but he was unable to Ô¨Ånd any quantitative evidence for the effect, even though researcherssuspected that dust might be responsible for the dark bands seen running across the MilkyWay (see Fig. 1). Further evidence for strong extinction could also be found in Shapley‚Äôsown data; no globular clusters were visible within a region between approximately¬±10‚ó¶ofthe Galactic plane, called thezone of avoidance. Shapley suggested that globular clusterswere apparently absent in the zone of avoidance because strong gravitational tidal forcesdisrupted the objects in that region. In reality, interstellar extinction is so severe within thezone of avoidance that the very bright clusters are simply undetectable. Clearly the problemsencountered by Kapteyn and Shapley in deducing the structure of our Galaxy point out thedifÔ¨Åculty of determining its general morphology from a nearly Ô¨Åxed location within the.The Milky Way Galaxyand W Virginis variable stars. Since these stars are easily identiÔ¨Åed in the clusters through their periodic variations in luminosity, it is a relatively simple matter to use their absolute magnitudes (obtained from a period‚Äìluminosity relation) to estimate their distances from the Sun. The distances to the variable stars correspond to the distances to the clusters in which they reside.

Galaxy‚Äôs disk. Unfortunately, given the immense distances involved, we are not likely tobe able to reach another, more favorable vantage point any time soonThe Effects of Interstellar ExtinctionTo see how interstellar extinction directly affects estimates of stellar distances,we Ô¨Åndd=10(mŒª‚àíMŒª‚àíAŒª+5)/5=d‚Ä≤10‚àíAŒª/5,(1)whered‚Ä≤=10(mŒª‚àíMŒª+5)/5is the erroneous estimate of distance made when extinction isneglected, andAŒªis the amount of extinction in magnitudes, and as a function of wavelength,that has occurred between the star and Earth. SinceAŒª‚â•0 in all cases (after all, extinctioncannot make a star appear brighter),d‚â§d‚Ä≤; the true distance is always less than the apparentdistance.In the disk of the Milky Way the typical rate of extinction in visible wavelengths is1 magnitude kpc‚àí1, although that value can vary dramatically if the line of sight includesdistinct nebulae such as giant molecular clouds. Fortunately, it is often possible to estimatethe amount of extinction by considering how dust affects the color of a star (interstellarreddening)Example 1.1.Suppose that a B0 main-sequence star with an absolute visual magnitudeofMV=‚àí4.0 is observed to have an apparent visual magnitude ofV=+8.2. Neglectinginterstellar extinction (i.e., assuming naively thatAV=0), the distance to the star wouldbe estimated to bed‚Ä≤=10(V‚àíMV+5)/5=2800 pc.However, if it is known by some independent means (such as reddening) that the amountof extinction along the line of sight is 1 mag kpc‚àí1, thenAV=kdmag, wherek=10‚àí3mag pc‚àí1anddis measured in pc. This givesd=10(V‚àíMV‚àíkd+5)/5=2800√ó10‚àíkd/5pc,which may be solved iteratively or graphically, giving a true distance to the star ofd=1400 pc.In this case the distance to the star would have been overestimated by almost a factor oftwo if the effects of interstellar extinction were not properly accounted for.Differential and Integrated Star CountsAs we have already mentioned, Kapteyn‚Äôs method of star counting was not based on directlydeterminingdfor individual stars. Rather, the numbers of stars visible in selected regionsof the sky are counted over a speciÔ¨Åed apparent magnitude range. Alternatively, all starsin the regions brighter than a chosen limit of apparent magnitude can be counted. These.The Milky Way Galaxy

approaches are known asdifferentialandintegrated star counts, respectively. The tech-nique of star counting is still used today to determine the number density of stars in the sky.The distribution depends on a variety of parameters, including direction, distance, chemicalcomposition, and spectral classiÔ¨Åcation. Such information is very helpful to astronomers intheir efforts to understand the structure and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy.LetnM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, r) dMbe the number density of stars with absolute magnitudes be-tweenMandM+dMand attributeSthat lie within a solid angle/Omegaœµin a speciÔ¨Åc directionat a distancerfrom the observer (Scould be composition or the Morgan‚ÄìKeenan spectraln(S, /Omegaœµ, r)=/integraldisplay‚àû‚àí‚àûnM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, r) dM.(2)If other speciÔ¨Åc information is also desired, those attributes could be included inSas well.However, the amount of data required to carry out star count analyses is formidable and oftenprohibitive; as the number of variables increases, so does the amount of data required. Inhis original study, Kapteyn consideredgeneralstar counts that tracked absolute magnitudeonly, regardless of spectral class.If the number densitynM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, r) dMis integrated over the volume of a cone deÔ¨Ånedby the solid angle/Omegaœµand extending from the observer atr=0 to some distancer=d, theresult isNM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, d) dM, the total number of stars with absolute magnitudes in therangeMtoM+dMthat are found within that conical volume of space (see Fig. 4).UsingdV=/Omegaœµr2drin spherical coordinates, this isNM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, d) dM=/bracketleftbigg/integraldisplayd0nM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, r) /Omegaœµr2dr/bracketrightbiggdM.(3)Equation ( 3) is the general expression for theintegrated star count, written in terms of

the limiting distance,d. Note that this means thatnMdMcan be obtained fromNMdM(with limiting distancer) by differentiating:nM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, r) dM=1/Omegaœµr2dNMdMdr.Of course, those stars sharing the same absolute magnitude will have different appar-ent magnitudes because they lie at different distances from us. We can use Eq. ( 1)to replace the limiting distance,d, with the apparent magnitudem. This results inNM(M, S, /Omegaœµ, m) dM, the integrated star count written in terms of the limiting magni-tude,m.

However, the resolution of Olbers‚Äôs paradox is not as simple when applied to theuniverse as a wholeThe modern process of gathering star count data involves the automated use of CCDdetectors to determineNMorAM.

2THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE GALAXYArmed with numerous examples of other galaxies beyond the Milky Way, together with thedata obtained from star counts and information gathered from various distance indicators,abundance analyses, and so on, astronomers have been able to piece together a model ofthe structure of our own Galaxy. However, it is important to point out that many of thedetails of the model remain uncertain and may even change in signiÔ¨Åcant ways as moreinformation becomes available. With that caveat, we will attempt to describe our currentunderstanding of the general morphology of the Galaxy in this section, leaving details ofits complex motions and fascinating nucleus until later in the chapter..The Milky Way Galaxy

A general model, based in part on observations of other galaxies believed to be similar to the Milky Way, is superimposed on the data; through successive iterations, the density function, the amount of interstellar extinction, and variations in composition with position are Ô¨Åne-tuned until a satisfactory match to the original data is obtained. However, given the complexity of the data and analysis, signiÔ¨Åcant uncertainties remain in our picture of stellar distributions within the Milky Way.

Distance to the Galactic CenterJust as Herschel and Kapteyn had believed, the Milky Way is a galaxy that possesses adisk of stars, of which the Sun is one member. However, as Shapley had suspected, the Sundoes not reside near the center of the disk but is actually located roughly one-third of theway out from the middle. As viewed from Earth, the center of the disk is in the direction ofthe constellation of Sagittarius corresponding to a very compact emission source known asSgr A‚ãÜ(see Section 4) at the J2000.0 equatorial coordinatesŒ±Sgr A‚ãÜ=17h45m40.0409s(6)Œ¥Sgr A‚ãÜ=‚àí29‚ó¶00‚Ä≤28.118‚Ä≤‚Ä≤.(7)Face-on and edge-on diagrams of the Galaxy are given in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.Some of the details of the Galaxy‚Äôs components (to be discussed later) are presented inTable 1.The Sun‚Äôs distance from the center of the Galaxy, known as thesolar Galactocentricdistance,R0, has been revised downward many times since Shapley‚Äôs Ô¨Årst estimate of15 kpc.

(R0is often used to normalize other distances in the Galaxy.)However, a number of studies have found that the value ofR0is about 8 kpc. For example,in 2003 Frank Eisenhauer and colleagues determined a value of 7.94¬±0.42 kpc based onastrometric and spectroscopic measurements of S2, the closest star to the Galactic center.Given the remaining uncertainties in the distance to the Galactic center, and given the

We will discuss composition effects now but will delay ourdiscussion of kinematics until the next section.dance of heavier elements; Population I stars are metal-rich, withZ‚àº0.02, Population IIstars are metal-poor, withZ‚àº0.001, and Population III stars are essentially devoid ofmetals, withZ‚àº0. In reality, a wide range of metallicities exists in stars. At one end arethe extreme Population I stars, and on the other, the hypothetical Population III stars (ifthey still exist). Between Population I and Population II stars are theintermediate(or,alternatively and suggestively,disk) population stars.To more carefully quantify the important parameter of composition, theratioof ironto hydrogen has become almost universally adopted by researchers because iron lines aregenerally readily identiÔ¨Åable in stellar spectra. During a supernova detonation (particularlyof Type Ia), iron is ejected, enriching the interstellar medium. New stars can then be createdwith a greater abundance of iron in their atmospheres than in their predecessors. As a result,iron content should correlate with stellar age, the youngest, most recently formed starshaving the highest relative abundance of iron. The iron-to-hydrogen ratio in the atmosphereof a star is compared with the Sun‚Äôs value through the expression[Fe/H]‚â°log10/bracketleftbigg(NFe/NH)star(NFe/NH)‚äô/bracketrightbigg,(11)a quantity often referred to as themetallicityStars with abundances identical to the Sun‚Äôs have[Fe/H]=0.0, less-metal-rich stars havenegative values, and more-metal-rich stars have positive values. Values ranging from‚àí5.4for old, extremely metal-poor stars to about 0.6 for young, extremely metal-rich stars havebeen measured in our Galaxy. According to studies of the main-sequence turn-off points inclusters (both globular and galactic), metal-rich stars tend to be younger than metal-poorones of similar spectral type. The apparent correlation between age and composition isreferred to as theage‚Äìmetallicity relation.Stars are generally classiÔ¨Åed according to the relative abun-

However, in many situations the correlation between age and[Fe/H]may not be asreliable as Ô¨Årst believed. For example, signiÔ¨Åcant numbers of Type Ia supernovae do notappear until roughly 109years after star formation begins, and since Type Ia supernovaeare responsible for most of the iron production, iron is not available in large quantitiesto enrich the interstellar medium. Furthermore, mixing of the interstellar medium after aSN Ia event may not be complete. In other words, a local region of the ISM may becomeenriched in iron after 109years, while another region may not experience the same level ofenrichment. Therefore, according to the age‚Äìmetallicity relation, the iron-rich region wouldsubsequently produce stars that appear younger, when in fact both regions are the same age.A second measure of ISM enrichment (and age) is based on[O/H], deÔ¨Åned in a waycompletely analogous to Eq. ( 11). Since core-collapse supernovae appear after only 107years following the onset of star formation (recall that they are the result of massive-starevolution) and they produce a higher abundance of oxygen relative to iron,[O/H]may alsobe used to determine the ages of Galactic components; some astronomers use[O/Fe]forthe same purpose.To complicate matters further, accurate age estimates depend critically on precise valuesfor distance moduli, which are needed to determine cluster main-sequence turn-off pointsAge Estimates of the Thin and Thick DisksIn the thin disk, typical values for the iron‚Äìhydrogen metallicity ratio are in the range‚àí0.5<[Fe/H]<0.3, while for the majority of stars in the thick disk,‚àí0.6<[Fe/H]<‚àí0.4 is more characteristic, although some thick-disk members may have metallicities atleast as low as[Fe/H]‚àº‚àí1.6.According to various age determinations, the stellar members of the thin disk are probablysigniÔ¨Åcantly younger than their thick-disk counterparts. It appears that star formation beganseveral billion years. On the other hand, star formation in the thick disk appears to havepredated the onset of star formation in the thin disk by two to three billion years. It isgenerally believed that the episode of thick-disk star formation spanned the time intervalbetween 10 and 11 Gyr ago.Mass-to-Light RatiosBased on data from star counts and orbital motions, the estimated stellar mass of the thindisk is roughly 6√ó1010M‚äôwith another 0.5√ó1010M‚äôof dust and gas. Furthermore,the luminosity in the blue-wavelength band isLB=1.8√ó1010L‚äô. When the Ô¨Årst of theseparameters is divided by the second, the resultingmass-to-light ratioisM/LB‚âà3M‚äô/L‚äô.This quantity gives us information about the kinds of stars responsible for the generationof the light.;The Milky Way Galaxy
errors of 0.1 in distance moduli lead to 10% errors in age. Needless to say, the important task of Galactic age determinations remains a major challenge in astronomy.
in the thin disk about 8 Gyr ago and is ongoing today. This conclusion is supported by the observations of white dwarf stars in the thin disk and theoretical estimates of their cooling times. There is also some evidence that star formation in the thin disk may not have been continuous over time but may have come in bursts with intervening gaps of

The mass of thethick disk is probably about 2 to 4√ó109M‚äô, or approximately 3% of the thin-disk mass.Spiral StructureSigniÔ¨Åcant structure exists within the disk itself. When neutral hydrogen clouds or relativelyyoung objects such as O and B stars, H II regions, and galactic (open) clusters are used astracers of Galactic structure, aspiral structureemerges, giving the disk the appearance ofa pinwheel. When other galaxies that possess distinct disks are observed in blue light (thedominant visible-wavelength band of hot, bright, young, high-mass main-sequence stars),these galaxies often exhibit similarly beautiful spiral structure. One such example is thegreat spiral galaxy of Andromeda, shown in Fig. 7. However, when the galaxies arein Fig. 8, the Sun seems to be located close to, but not actually in, one of the spiral armfeatures known as theOrion‚ÄìCygnus arm, or simply theOrion arm(this feature is alsoknown as theOrion spursince it is probably not a full spiral arm structure). Spiral armsget their names from the constellations in which they are observed.The interstellar gas and dust clouds that plagued Kapteyn‚Äôs attempts at determining theoverall structure of the Galaxy and that are clearly evident in Fig. 1 are primarily locatednear the midplane and found preferentially in the spiral arms. If it were possible to view ourGalaxy from a vantage point outside the disk but along the plane, it would probably appearsimilar to NGC 891,3the galaxy shown in Fig. 9.3NGC is a designation indicating that the galaxy is a member of theNewGeneralCatalogAlong the main sequence, a star‚Äôs

Molecular hydrogen and cool dust are found predominantly in the regions 3 to 8 kpcand 3 to 7 kpc from the Galactic center, respectively (i.e., inside the solar circle), whileatomic hydrogen can be found in the region from 3 kpc out to the edge of the Galactic disk(25 kpc). It appears that H2and the dust are most tightly conÔ¨Åned to the plane of the Galaxy,with vertical scale heights above or below the midplane of perhaps 90 pc or less. This isonly about 25% of the value for stars in the thin disk and on the order of 9% of the scaleheight of thick-disk stars. In the region near the Sun, the scale height for atomic hydrogenis approximately 160 pc. The total mass ofHIi sestimated to be 4√ó109M‚äôand the massof H2is approximately 109M‚äô. In the solar neighborhood the total mass density of gasis 0.04 M‚äôpc‚àí3, of which atomic hydrogen accounts for approximately 77%, moleculescontribute 17%, and ions add an additional 6%.At distances beyond 12 kpc from the center of the Galaxy, the scale height of H I increasesdramatically, reaching a value of more than 900 pc. In addition, the distribution of H I in theouter reaches of the Galaxy is no longer strictly conÔ¨Åned to the plane but, rather, exhibitsa well-deÔ¨Ånedwarpthat reaches a maximum angle of deviation from the plane of 15‚ó¶.Amap of the H I distribution at a Galactic radius of 13.6 kpc is shown in Fig. 10.

Warped H Idistributions such as the one observed in our own Galaxy appear to be common featuresin other spiral galaxies as well, including Andromeda (in some spiral galaxies the warpangle can reach 90‚ó¶). Although we do not yet fully understand the dynamics that lead to thecreation of warps (they do not seem to be the result of simple gravitational perturbationsfrom one or more external galaxies, for example), they do seem to be associated with thedistribution of mass in the outer regions of the Galaxy, beyond where most of the luminosityis produced.Hydrogen clouds can also be found at high latitudes. Although some of these clouds havepositive radial velocities, implying that they are moving away from the disk, the majoritypossess large negative radial velocities (up to 400 km s‚àí1or more), as measured by their21-cm emission. There appear to be two types of sources responsible for thesehigh-velocityclouds. In one process, clouds of gas ejected from supernovae are driven to large values ofz, where they eventually cool and rain back down onto the Galactic plane. This suggestionis known as theGalactic fountain model. It also appears that the Galaxy is accreting gasfrom intergalactic space, as well as from a number of its small satellite galaxies; hence thepredominance of negative-radial-velocity clouds.In addition, a very hot, tenuous gas exists at distances up to or exceeding 70 kpc fromthe Galactic center. TheFar Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer(FUSE) has been able todetect O VI absorption lines in the spectra of distant extragalactic sources and halo starsproduced when the light passes through the gas in the Galactic halo. Using O VI as a tracerof the hydrogen gas, the strengths of the O VI absorption lines imply a number density ofThe Milky Way Galaxy

Assuming that the distribution is approximately sphericalwith a radius ofR‚àº70 kpc leads to an estimate of the mass of the gas ofM‚âÉ4√ó108M‚äô.If the gas distribution is somewhat Ô¨Çattened, the total mass could exceed 109M‚äô. In orderto support the gas against gravitational collapse, the gas temperature must be every hot. Itis estimated that the temperature of this hot, tenuous gas is in excess of 106K, with thehigh gas temperature perhaps being due to collisions between infalling gas and existing gasin the Galaxy. The gas is sometimes referred to as acoronal gas, suggestive of its hightemperature.The Disruption of Satellite GalaxiesAnother unusual high-latitude feature is theMagellanic Stream, a narrow band of H Iemission stretching more than 180‚ó¶across the sky and trailing the Southern Hemisphere‚ÄôsMagellanic Clouds (recall that the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are small satellitegalaxies of the Milky Way; the LMC and SMC are located 52 and 61 kpc from Earth,respectively).4The Magellanic Stream appears to be the result of a tidal encounter of theMagellanic Clouds with the Milky Way some 200 Myr ago. It has also been suggested thatthe Magellanic Stream may owe some of its structure to the interaction with our Galaxy‚Äôshot coronal gas.Other satellite galaxies have also tidally interacted with the Milky Way, and still othersare currently doing so. For example, in 1995 Rodrigo Ibata and his colleagues announcedthe discovery of a previously unknown dwarf spheriodal galaxy in Sagittarius. At a distanceof only 24 kpc from Earth and 16 kpc from the center of the Milky Way, the Sagittarius dwarfspheroidal is the closest galaxy to Earth. It is clearly elongated with the long axis directedtoward the center of the Galaxy and, with a radial velocity of 140 km s‚àí1, has had onlya few orbital encounters with the Milky Way. Evidently the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidalgalaxy, along with its globular clusters, is being incorporated into the Milky Way Galaxy.Using the2-Micron All Sky Survey(2MASS) catalog, researchers have also identiÔ¨Åedan overdensity of stars in the constellation Canis Major near the plane of the Milky Way.A group of globular clusters and open clusters are associated with this overdensity in bothposition and radial velocity. This feature strongly suggests that another dwarf satellite galaxywas integrated into the Milky Way in the past and may now be a part of the thick disk.The unusual globular clusterœâCentauri also seems to be the remnant of a dwarf galaxythat has been subsumed by the Milky Way.œâCen is the largest and brightest globular clustervisible from Earth and has an unusually high surface brightness. It appears that this globularcluster is the stripped core of another former satellite galaxy. (It has been suggested that theglobular clusters M54 and NGC 2419 were also once dwarf galaxies that suffered the samefate asœâCen.)The Galactic BulgeAlthough the vertical scale height of the thin disk is near 350 pc in the vicinity of the Sun,that value increases somewhat toward the inner regions of the Galaxy, where the disk meetstheGalactic bulge.

Using the COBE data, together with observations ofRR Lyraes and K and M giants, we Ô¨Ånd that the variation in the number density of stars inthe bulge corresponds to a vertical scale height that ranges from 100 pc to 500 pc, dependingon the ages of the stars used to make the determination; younger stars yield smaller scaleheights.The surface brightness,I, of the bulge (measured in units of L‚äôpc‚àí2) exhibits anapproximate radial dependence of the formlog10/bracketleftbiggI (r)Ie/bracketrightbigg=‚àí3.3307/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggrre/parenrightbigg1/4‚àí1/bracketrightBigg,(13)which is often referred to as ar1/4law[the law was Ô¨Årst formulated by Gerard deVaucouleurs(1918‚Äì1995) in 1948 and is also referred to as ade Vaucouleurs proÔ¨Åle].reis a referenceradius (called theeffective radius) andIeis the surface brightness atre.

(Wewill Ô¨Ånd that the de Vaucouleurs proÔ¨Åle is a general distribution for relaxed, spheroidalsystems.)A serious difÔ¨Åculty in observing the properties of the bulge rests in the large amount ofextinction at visible wavelengths due to the dust between the Sun and the Galactic center.The total amount of extinction within several degrees of the center can be more than 30magnitudes. However, a number of lines of sight exist for which the amount of extinctionis minimal. The most well known of these isBaade‚Äôs window, which Walter Baade (1893‚ÄìThe Milky Way Galaxy

1960) discovered in 1944 while observing the globular cluster NGC 6522. Baade realizedthat by observing in that region of the sky, he was able to see RR Lyraes that were actuallybeyond the Galactic center. Baade‚Äôs window is 3.9‚ó¶below the Galactic center, and the lineof sight passes within 550 pc of the center. It is believed that NGC 6522 is located withinthe bulge.From the observational evidence, the chemical abundances of stars in the bulge varysigniÔ¨Åcantly, ranging from quite metal-poor to very metal-rich;‚àí2<[Fe/H]<0.5. In fact,based on the chemical abundances, it appears that three somewhat distinct age groupingsexist in the central bulge. One set of stars appear to be very young, with ages less than200 Myr, a second set has ages between 200 Myr and 7 Gyr, and the third set tends to beolder than 7 Gyr (perhaps up to 10 Gyr or older).In a trend that on initial reÔ¨Çection appears to be counterintuitive, the oldest stars in thebulge tend to have the highest metallicities, while the youngest stars have a fairly uniformdistribution of metallicities across the range from‚àí2t o0.5. This pattern is probably dueto a burst of massive star formation when the Galaxy was young. Apparently core-collapsesupernovae enriched the interstellar medium early in the life of the bulge, implying thatsubsequent generations of stars contained an enhanced abundance of heavier elements. Themore uniform distribution of metallicity in recent generations of stars could be the resultof fresh, infalling material. It is this type of complication that must be considered carefullywhen employing the age‚Äìmetallicity relationThe Milky Way‚Äôs Central BarAlthough it was originally thought to be essentially spheroidal in nature, a number ofobserving campaigns and database studies have determined that the budge contains a distinctbar.5The Milky Way‚Äôs central bar is clearly depicted in the artist‚Äôs drawing of the Galaxyshown in Fig. 5. The bar has a radius (one-half length) from the galactic center of4.4¬±0.5 kpc and is oriented at an angle ofœÜ=44‚ó¶¬±10‚ó¶with respect to the line-of-sightangle from Earth to the Galactic center. It also seems that the bar is somewhat thicker in theplane of the Galaxy than in thezdirection; the dimension ratios are approximately 1:0.5:0.4.ars are dynamically stable structures and common featuresof many spiral galaxies.)The 3-kpc Expanding ArmA unique feature in the inner regions of the Galaxy that is most easily observed at the 21-cmwavelength ofHIi st h e3-kpc expanding arm, a gas cloud that is moving toward us atroughly 50 km s‚àí1. Once believed to be the product of a gigantic explosion in the center ofthe Galaxy, the rapidly moving structure is now thought to be a consequence of the presenceof the stellar bar. Rather than being driven away from the center in an explosive event thatwould require an unrealistic 1052J of energy, the gas cloud is merely in a very ellipticalorbit about the Galactic center resulting from gravitational perturbations from the bar.5One such database study is the analysis of the GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire)point source catalog of some 30 million infrared sources in the direction of the inner Galaxy, produced by theSpitzer Space Telescope. The Galactic bulge is much more transparent to infrared wavelengths than to visiblewavelengths..

The Stellar Halo and Globular Cluster SystemThe last luminous component of the Galaxy is thestellarhalo(or simply the halo), composedof the globular clusters and thoseÔ¨Åeld stars(stars that are not members of clusters) that havelarge velocity components perpendicular to the Galactic plane. These Ô¨Åeld stars are oftenreferred to ashigh-velocity starssince, as we will learn in the next section, their velocitycomponents differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from those of the Sun. Most of the globular clusters and thehigh-velocity stars can reach positions that are far above or below the plane of the Galaxy.Although it appeared to Shapley that all of the known globular clusters were distributednearly spherically about the Galactic center, it has become apparent that two distinct spatialdistributions exist, delineated by metallicity. Older, metal-poor clusters whose membershave[Fe/H]<‚àí0.8 belong to an extended spherical halo of stars, while younger clusterswith[Fe/H]>‚àí0.8 form a much Ô¨Çatter distribution and may even be associated with thethick disk. The spatial distribution of the two metallicity groups is shown in Fig. 12.The notable exception is the well-studied globular cluster 47 Tucana (47 Tuc; also knownas NGC 104), which is located 3.2 kpc below the Galactic plane and has an unusually highmetallicity of[Fe/H]=‚àí0.67. Some astronomers have argued that 47 Tuc is a memberof the halo population, while others consider 47 Tuc to be a member of the thick disk.Our Galaxy is known to contain at least 150 globular clusters with distances from thecenter of the Milky Way ranging from 500 pc to 120 kpc. The youngest globular clustersappear to be about 11 Gyr old, and the oldest are probably a little over 13 Gyr old.6It nowappears that a signiÔ¨Åcant age spread of two billion years or so exists between the youngestand oldest members of the halo.

Although 144 of the globular clusters are found within 42 kpc of the Galactic center, 6globular clusters have been found between 69 and 123 kpc of the Galactic center. Someastronomers have suggested that those six most distant clusters may have been captured bythe Milky Way or may be dwarf spheroidal galaxies, much asœâCen and the Sagittariusdwarf galaxy may have been. If we do not include these very remote objects, the metal-poorclusters seem to be conÔ¨Åned to a halo with a radius of approximately 42 kpc. However, thedetection of extremely distant and luminous Ô¨Åeld stars suggests that a stellar halo radius of50 kpc may be more appropriate.The number density proÔ¨Åle of the metal-poor globular clusters and the Ô¨Åeld stars in thehalo has the formnhalo(r)=n0,halo(r/a)‚àí3.5,(14)wheren0,halo‚âÉ4√ó10‚àí5pc‚àí3is roughly 0.2% of the thin disk‚Äôs midplane value (seeEq. 9). The scale length (a) of the number density distribution is several thousandparsecs. At visible wavelengths, the effective radius of the halor1/4law (Eq. 13) isre=2.7 kpc.Metal-rich globular clusters seem to have many characteristics in common with thick-disk Ô¨Åeld stars, including spatial distribution. Just like the thick-disk Ô¨Åeld stars, the verticalscale height of these clusters is on the order of 1 kpc, unlike the much larger scale lengthof the metal-poor clusters.However, based on studies that use RR Lyraes as tracers of other Ô¨Åeld stars in the halo,there is some question about whether Ô¨Åeld stars actually share the same spatial distributionpattern as the corresponding metal-poor clusters. Instead, the Ô¨Åeld stars may occupy avolume that is appreciably Ô¨Çattened, perhaps as much asc/a‚àº0.6, wherecis the minoraxis of a spheroid in the direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane, andais the majoraxis (see Fig. 13). Such a discrepancy in distributions, if real, could have a signiÔ¨ÅcantinÔ¨Çuence on an ultimate model of Galaxy formation and evolution. On the other hand, other

astronomers believe that a single value of 0.8‚â§c/a‚â§0.9 probably applies to the Ô¨Åeld starsand clusters alike.Based largely on star counts, the totalstellarmass density in the solar neighborhoodis approximately 0.05 M‚äôpc‚àí3. Of that total, the contribution due to high-velocity halostars is on the order of 0.2%, or 1√ó10‚àí4M‚äôpc‚àí3. Combining this with the spatial densitypower law yields a total estimated mass of the stellar halo on the order of 1√ó109M‚äô,o fwhich roughly 1% is the combined mass of the globular clusters; the remainder is lockedup in Ô¨Åeld stars. TheB-band luminosity of the halo is estimated to be 1√ó109L‚äô, giving amass-to-light ratio on the order of unity (the exact value is quite uncertain).When all of the components of the Galaxy are considered together, its totalB-band lumi-nosity isLB,tot=2.3¬±0.6√ó1010L‚äô. However, approximately one-third of the Galaxy‚Äôsemission is in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum and is primarily associatedwith interstellar dust. Including IR emissions, the bolometric luminosity of the Galaxy isLbol=3.6√ó1010L‚äô.The Dark Matter HaloWhen the masses of all of the luminous components of the Galaxy are combined (the thinand thick disks, the interstellar dust and gas, the Galactic bulge, the stellar halo, and thebar), the total mass of luminous matter in the Galaxy is estimated to be 9√ó1010M‚äô.A swe shall see in the next section, this value is in good agreement with the orbital motionof the Sun about the Galactic center, but it does not explain the orbits of stars and gasat Galactocentric distances much greater thanR0. Apparently there is still another crucialcomponent to the overall structure of our Galaxy. Along with inÔ¨Çuencing orbital motions,this unseen element of Galactic structure may also be responsible for the generation of thewarps seen in the H I distribution near the outer edges of the luminous disk.Thisdark matter haloseems to be roughly spherically distributed, enveloping the stellarhalo and extending out to at least 230 kpc. Based on its gravitational inÔ¨Çuence over luminousmatter, the dark matter halo has an apparent mass distribution of the formœÅ(r)=œÅ0(r/a)(1+r/a)2,(15)whereœÅ0andaare chosen by Ô¨Åtting the mass distribution in the dark matter haloThis functional dependence behaves as 1/rwhenr‚â™aand as 1/r3whenr‚â´a. The mass of the dark matter halo may be as great as5.4√ó1011M‚äôwithin 50 kpc of the Galactic center and 1.9√ó1012M‚äôwithin 230 kpc ofthe Galactic center. It appears that the dark matter halo accounts for about 95% of the entiremass of the Galaxy. [The empirical justiÔ¨Åcation for a dark matter density distribution suchas Eq. (15) will be discussed]The composition of the dark matter halo is still a mystery. It cannot be in the formof interstellar dust, because dust betrays its presence through the extinction of starlight.Furthermore, the dark matter halo cannot be composed of gas, because absorption lineswould be apparent when observing halo stars. One possible class of candidates are referredto asweakly interacting massive particles(WIMPs). WIMPs would not contribute tothe overall luminosity of the Galaxy, but they would affect it through their gravitational.in Section 3The Milky Way Galaxy

TheGalactic coordinate systemexploits the natural symmetry introduced by the existence of the Galactic disk.The intersection of the midplane of the Galaxy with the celestial sphere forms what isvery nearly a great circle, known as theGalactic equator.7This orientation is depicted inFig. 16.Galactic latitude(b) andGalactic longitude(‚Ñì) are deÔ¨Åned from a vantagepoint taken to be the Sun, as shown in Fig. 17.

Galactic longitude (also in degrees) is measured east along the Galacticequator, beginningnearthe Galactic center, to the point of intersection with the great circleused to measure Galactic latitude.By international convention, the J2000.0 equatorial coordinates of the north Galacticpole (b=90‚ó¶) areŒ±NGP=12h51m26.28sŒ¥NGP=27‚ó¶7‚Ä≤41.7‚Ä≤‚Ä≤,and the origin of the Galactic coordinate system (‚Ñì0=0‚ó¶,b0=0‚ó¶) corresponds toŒ±0=17h45m37.20sŒ¥0=‚àí28‚ó¶56‚Ä≤9.6‚Ä≤‚Ä≤.Note that the center of the Galaxy(Œ±Sgr A‚ãÜ,Œ¥Sgr A‚ãÜ)given by Eqs.

A graphical form of thetransformations that does not suffer from this multiplicity is presented in Fig. 18.A Cylindrical Coordinate System for Galactic MotionsThe motions of stars in the solar neighborhood allow us to glean important clues regardingthe large-scale structure of the Galaxy. Although the Galactic coordinate system is usefulfor representing the locations of objects within the Galaxy as seen from Earth, it is not themost convenient choice for studying kinematics and dynamics. One reason is that the Sun,which is the origin of the Galactic system, is itself moving about the center of the Galaxy. Inaddition, a coordinate system centered on the Sun constitutes a noninertial reference framewith respect to Galactic motions.Therefore, to complement the Galactic coordinate system, a cylindrical coordinate sys-tem is used that places the center of the Galaxy at the origin. In this system the radialcoordinateRincreases outward, the angular coordinateŒ∏is pointed in the direction of ro-tation of the Galaxy, and the vertical coordinatezincreases to the north (see Fig. 19).Furthermore, the corresponding velocity components are traditionally labeled/Piœµ‚â°dRdt,/Thetaœµ‚â°RdŒ∏dt,Z‚â°dzdt.(22)It is worth noting that this set of directional choices results in a left-handed coordinatesystem instead of a more conventional right-handed one. This occurs because, when viewedfrom the north Galactic pole, the Galaxy rotates clockwise, rather than counterclockwise.(Fortunately, we are not going to be concerned with cross products in this analysis. Recallthat cross products are right-handed by deÔ¨Ånition.)Peculiar Motions and the Local Standard of RestSince all of our observations are made from Earth (or at least relatively near it, in the caseof satellites), and because we can transform those observations to Sun-centered ones byremoving any effects resulting from the rotational and orbital motions of Earth or motionsof the spacecraft, we will consider the Sun as the site of all observations of the Galaxy.In particular, since the Earth‚ÄìSun distance is very small when compared to any distanceson a Galactic scale, we need not concern ourselves with the change in position, only withchanges in velocity.The Milky Way Galaxy

(Note thatsome authors deÔ¨Åne the radial coordinate to be positive toward the Galactic center. It should also benoted that the coordinate system deÔ¨Åned here isnota right-handed coordinate system.)Before we can hope to make a Ô¨Ånal transformation from the Sun to the center of theGalaxy, however, we must also understand the Sun‚Äôs motion. In fact, the Sun does notfollow a simple planar orbit or even a closed nonplanar orbit; instead, as it moves about theGalactic center, it is also currently moving slowly inward (in the negative-Rdirection) andfarther north, away from the midplane (positive-zdirection).To investigate the motion of the Sun and the other stars in the solar neighborhood, wewill Ô¨Årst deÔ¨Åne thedynamical local standard of rest(dynamical LSR) to be a point thatisinstantaneouslycentered on the Sun and moving in aperfectly circular orbitalong thesolar circle about the Galactic center. An alternative deÔ¨Ånition for the LSR known as thekinematic local standard of restis based on the average motions of stars in the solarneighborhood. Although with the right choice of reference stars, dynamical and kinematicLSRs agree quite well, it can be shown that the kinematic LSR systematically lags behindthe dynamical LSR. Throughout the remainder of this text, ‚Äúthe LSR‚Äù will always refer tothe dynamical LSR.The velocity components of the LSR must be/PiœµLSR‚â°0,/ThetaœµLSR‚â°/Thetaœµ0,ZLSR‚â°0,where/Thetaœµ0‚â°/Thetaœµ(R0)andR0is the solar Galactocentric distance. Note that once the LSR ischosen, the Sun immediately begins to drift away from it, implying that we would effectivelyneed to redeÔ¨Åne the reference point constantly. In reality this is not a signiÔ¨Åcant problembecause (fortunately) the 230-Myr orbital period of the LSR is very long compared to thetime since modern telescopic observations began (and even longer compared to the lifetimeof a typical research grant); consequently, there has not been sufÔ¨Åcient time for the effectto become noticeable.The velocity of a starrelativetotheLSRis known as the star‚Äôspeculiar velocityand isgiven byV=(VR,VŒ∏,Vz)‚â°(u, v, w),(23)The Milky Way Galaxy

The reason is that with symmetriesabout both the rotation axis and the midplane, there should be as many stars moving inwardas outward, and there should be as many stars moving toward the north Galactic pole astoward the south Galactic pole. In reality this is not quite true because the Galaxy is notprecisely axisymmetric, but the error is not signiÔ¨Åcant for our purposes here. As a result,we shall assume that, summing over a sample ofNnearby stars,‚ü®u‚ü©=1NN/summationdisplayi=1ui‚âÉ0,(27)‚ü®w‚ü©=1NN/summationdisplayi=1wi‚âÉ0.(28)The same assumption cannot be made for thevcomponent, however. To see why, considerthe situations depicted in Fig. 20. Stars with different average orbital radii must followpaths that bring them very close to the LSR if they are to be considered members of thesolar neighborhood and eligible for inclusion in the calculation of‚ü®v‚ü©. If we consider thespecial case thatu=0 andw=0 for all stars in our sample, then the stars must be at eithertheir most distant point from the Galactic center (apogalacticon) or their closest approachto the Galactic center (perigalacticon) when they coincide with the LSR; this is true ofAandB, respectively.

Unfortunately, this requires a theory of Galactic motionthat is beyond the scope of the present argument. However, qualitatively the procedureinvolves deriving an analytical expression for‚ü®v‚ü©in terms of the radial variation in thenumber density of stars in the solar neighborhood. The justiÔ¨Åcation for this relationshiplies in the argument made concerning the lag of stellar motions behind the LSR due tothe increase in number density with decreasing Galactocentric distance.

A stellarsample that produces a larger dispersion inumeans that a wider range of elliptical orbitsare included. This results in a more negative average value ofvfor the sample because ofthe larger fraction of the stellar population withR<R0; there are more stars in the samplewithv<0 than withv>0. Alternatively, asœÉ2udecreases, fewer stars will have orbits thatare appreciably noncircular and‚ü®v‚ü©will approach zero. From Eq.

Overall, thesolar motion is approximately 13.4k ms‚àí1toward a point in the constellation of Hercules.The point toward which the Sun is moving is called thesolar apex; the point away fromwhich the Sun is retreating is thesolar antapex(located in Columba). It is important tonote, however, that the exact value for the solar motion and the location of the solar apexdepend on the choice of reference stars.Now that the solar motion is known, the velocities of stars relative to the Sun canbe transformed into peculiar motions relative to the LSR. It is then possible to plot onecomponent of peculiar motion against another for a speciÔ¨Åed sample of stars in the solarneighborhood in order to obtain important information about their kinematics. Such plotsresult in patterns known asvelocity ellipsoids. As depicted in a diagram ofuversusv(Fig. 21), when young, metal-rich main-sequence A stars are used, the range in velocitiesabout the LSR is fairly limited (a small dispersion), for older K giants a wider variation inbothuandvis observed, and when old, metal-poor red dwarfs are plotted, the spread iseven larger (a large dispersion). The same general behavior is seen in plots ofwversusv,whereas a much more symmetric diagram results whenwis plotted againstu.SpeciÔ¨Åc features of Fig. 21 are worth discussing in more detail. First is the very notice-able relationship between metallicity and velocity dispersion, called avelocity‚Äìmetallicityrelation. When the velocity‚Äìmetallicity and age‚Äìmetallicity relations are combined, the ve-locity ellipsoids suggest that the oldest stars in the Galaxy have the widest range of peculiarvelocities, a trend that is evident in all three coordinates. Because stars with the smallestpeculiar velocities do not drift away from the LSR as quickly, they must occupy orbits thatare similar to that of the LSR, implying that these young stars are members of the thin disk.On the other hand, the stars with the largest peculiar velocities follow very different pathsabout the center of the Galaxy. In particular, stars with large|w|must be passing throughThe Milky Way Galaxy

These old, metal-poor stars are the high-velocity stars that were mentionedin the last section as being members of the stellar halo.A second common feature of peculiar velocity diagrams is the clear asymmetries in thevelocity ellipsoids along thev-axis as a function of metallicity or age (this effect is knownasasymmetric drift). Few stars are observed withv>+65 km s‚àí1, but there are metal-poor RR Lyraes and subdwarfs withv<‚àí250 km s‚àí1. In fact, as suggested by the dashedline in Fig. 21, a nearly circular ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù with a radius of roughly 300 km s‚àí1canbe drawn around the high-velocity stars. The center of the velocity envelope appears to benearv=‚àí220 km s‚àí1for bothu‚Äìvandw‚Äìvdiagrams. If on average the stellar halo isrotating very slowly (if at all), then the orbital velocity of the LSR should reveal itself asa point of symmetry along thev-axis. This is because halo stars with/Thetaœµ‚âÉ0 (no velocitycomponent in the direction of Galactic rotation) should exhibit peculiarvvelocities thatsimply reÔ¨Çect the motion of the LSR (i.e.,v‚âÉ‚àí/Thetaœµ0). Stars that have orbital componentsthat are in the opposite sense from the overall Galactic rotation direction havev<‚àí/Thetaœµ0.By this argument it appears that the orbital speed of the LSR is/Thetaœµ0(R0)=220 km s‚àí1,(36)the presently accepted IAU standard. This value has also been measured using groups ofexternal galaxies for reference.88Kuijken and Tremaine (1994) have suggested that the IAU value of/Thetaœµ0may be too large. Based on a set ofself-consistent solutions to various Galactic parameters, they argue for/Thetaœµ0=180 km s‚àí1.The Milky Way Galaxy

Example 3.1.An estimate of the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy interior to the solarGalactocentric distance can be made using Kepler‚Äôs third law, together withR0and/Thetaœµ0.UsingR0=8 kpc and/Thetaœµ0=220 km s‚àí1, the orbital period of the LSR isPLSR=2œÄR0/Thetaœµ0=230 Myr.Assuming that the mass of the Galaxy within the solar circle is much greater than the massof a test particle orbiting along with the LSR, and that the bulk of the Galaxy‚Äôs mass isdistributed spherically symmetrically, Kepler‚Äôs third law givesMLSR=4œÄ2R30GP2LSR=8.8√ó1010M‚äô.This value compares well with the estimate of the mass of luminous matter quoted onmatter halo is included.In 1927, Jan Oort (1900‚Äì1992) proposed that since no stars had been observed withv>+65 km s‚àí1, the escape velocity of the Galaxy must be/Thetaœµ0+65 km s‚àí1‚àº300 km s‚àí1relative to the Galactic center. In fact, we know today that a small number of extremely high-velocity stars do exist in the solar neighborhood with speeds of‚àº500 km s‚àí1relative to thecenter of the Galaxy. Since these stars have not escaped from the Galaxy, it seems that thestrong asymmetry nearv‚àº+65 km s‚àí1simply points to a deÔ¨Åciency in very high-velocitystars.Differential Galactic Rotation and Oort‚Äôs ConstantsIn 1927 Jan Oort also derived a series of relations that have become the framework withwhich astronomers have attempted to determine the differential rotation curve of the Galacticdisk. To simplify the discussion, we will assume that all motions are circular about the centerof the Galaxy.Consider the situation depicted in Fig. 22. Assume that the Sun (atO) and a star orsome other object (atS) are orbiting the Galactic center (atC) in the Galactic midplane. Thevelocity vector that is measured between the Sun and the star at pointSis therelativevelocitybetween the two objects. Therefore, in order to compare the observed-velocity vector tothe object‚Äôs true velocity with respect to the Galactic center, it is necessary to consider thedifference between the star‚Äôs motion and the Sun‚Äôs motion. Of course, in practice it is notthe relative space motion that is measured directly but the radial velocity and the propermotion, with the proper motion being converted into the transverse velocity if the distancedto the star is known.If the line of sight is in the direction of the Galactic longitude‚Ñì, and if/Thetaœµ(R)is the orbitalvelocity curve as a function of distance from the Galactic center, then the relative radialand transverse velocities of the star are, respectively,vr=/ThetaœµcosŒ±‚àí/Thetaœµ0sin‚Ñì,vt=/ThetaœµsinŒ±‚àí/Thetaœµ0cos‚Ñì,earlier,butitismuchlessthanthetotalmassestimateoftheGalaxywhenthedarkThe Milky Way Galaxy

Equations ( 37) and ( 38) are valid as long as the assumption of circular motion isjustiÔ¨Åed.Although the Sun‚Äôs motion around the Galactic center is not perfectly circular, its peculiarvelocity relative to the LSR is small compared to/Thetaœµ0(only about 6%). As a result, to aÔ¨Årst approximation, Eqs. ( 37) and ( 38) provide a reasonable estimate of/Omegaœµ=/Omegaœµ(R)if the other parameters are known. However,dis in general very difÔ¨Åcult to measureunless the object is close enough to yield to trigonometric parallax, or perhaps some otherreasonably reliable distance estimate may be applicable (for instance, the star may be aCepheid variable).Another complication arises because of the effects of interstellar extinction. Our abilityto observe Galactic structure to great distances is severely limited at visual wavelengths.Unless we are making observations in relatively unobscured directions such as Baade‚Äôswindow, we are restricted to seeing stars out to a few thousand parsecs from the Sun. Oneimportant exception to this constraint (to be discussed in more detail below) is the 21-cm-wavelength band of H I; virtually the entire Galaxy is optically thin to 21-cm radiation,making that wavelength band a valuable tool for studying Galactic structure.Because of the distance limitation at optical wavelengths, Oort derived a set of ap-proximate equations forvrandvtthat are valid only in the region near the Sun. Despitethis restriction, these alternative formulae are still able to provide a surprising amount ofinformation about the large-scale structure of the Galaxy.We make the assumption here that/Omegaœµ(R)is a smoothly varying function ofRso that theTaylor expansion of/Omegaœµ(R)about/Omegaœµ0(R0)is given by/Omegaœµ(R)=/Omegaœµ0(R0)+d/OmegaœµdR/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleR0(R‚àíR0)+¬∑¬∑¬∑.Thus, to Ô¨Årst order, thedifferencebetween/Omegaœµand/Omegaœµ0is/Omegaœµ‚àí/Omegaœµ0‚âÉd/OmegaœµdR/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleR0(R‚àíR0),and theapproximate valueof/Omegaœµis/Omegaœµ‚âÉ/Omegaœµ0.If we also make use of the identity/Omegaœµ=/Thetaœµ/R, Eqs.

For stars in the directions‚Ñì=0‚ó¶and‚Ñì=180‚ó¶, the lines of sight are perpendicular to their motions relative to the LSR. Asa result, the radial velocity must be zero. For‚Ñì=90‚ó¶or 270‚ó¶, the stars being observed arein essentially the same circular orbit as the Sun and are moving with the same speed, soagainvr=0 km s‚àí1. At intermediate angles the situation is somewhat more complicated,however. For instance, if we assume that in the neighborhood of the Sun,/Omegaœµ(R)is monoton-ically decreasing outward, then at‚Ñì=45‚ó¶, the star being observed is closer to the Galacticcenter and is ‚Äúoutrunning‚Äù the Sun; hence a positive radial velocity would be measured.For‚Ñì=135‚ó¶, the Sun is ‚Äúovertaking‚Äù the star and a negative radial velocity results. At‚Ñì=225‚ó¶, the Sun is moving away from the star, producing a positive radial velocity, and at‚Ñì=315‚ó¶, the star is gaining on the Sun, causing the observed radial velocity to be negative.of thevrandvtcurves (Eqs. 41 and 42, respectively) giveA, and the vertical offsetinvtgivesB.It is now possible to derive several important relationships between the Oort constantsAandB, and thelocalparameters of Galactic rotation,R0,/Thetaœµ0,/Omegaœµ0=/Thetaœµ0/R0, and(d/Thetaœµ/dR)R0.For instance, from Eqs.

Because of differential Galactic rotation, each cloudhas a different radial velocity relative to the Sun.As has already been mentioned, 21-cm emission fromHIi sable to penetrate virtually theentire Galaxy, making it an indispensable tool in probing the structure of the Milky Way.By measuringvras a function of‚Ñì, the Galactic rotation curve can be determined fromEq. ( 37), provided that the distance of the emitting region from the Sun can be found.Figure 24(a) shows a typical intensity distribution for the 21-cm emission line ofH I along a particular line of sight. When a speciÔ¨Åc cloud is encountered along the lineof sight, the wavelength of the radiation from that cloud is Doppler shifted because of theeffects of differential Galactic rotation. Furthermore, the intensity of the radiation at a givenwavelength (or velocity) is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms along the line ofsight in the cloud. The peaks of the line proÔ¨Åle shown in Fig. 24(a) correspond to theclouds shown in Fig. 24(b).The principal difÔ¨Åculty in using 21-cm radiation to determine/Omegaœµ(R), and hence/Thetaœµ(R),lies in measuringd. This problem can be overcome by selecting the largest radial veloc-ity measured along each line of sight, which must originate in the regionRminfrom theGalactic center, implying thatd=R0cos‚Ñì. By measuringvr,maxfor 0‚ó¶<‚Ñì<90‚ó¶and270‚ó¶<‚Ñì<360‚ó¶, we can determine the rotation curve within the solar Galactocentric ra-dius. Unfortunately, this technique does not work for Galactic longitudes 90‚ó¶<‚Ñì<270‚ó¶because there is no unique orbit for which a maximum radial velocity can be observed. Themethod also tends to break down near‚Ñì=90‚ó¶and‚Ñì=270‚ó¶becausevrbecomes ratherinsensitive to changes in distance from the Sun. For longitudes within approximately 20‚ó¶ofthe Galactic center, further problems develop; clouds that have markedly noncircular mo-tions exist in that region, perhaps because of the gravitational perturbations of the centralbar, so the assumptions underlying the preceding analysis are not valid.The Flat Rotation Curve and Evidence of Dark MatterTo measure/Thetaœµ(R)forR>R0, we must rely on objects available in the Galactic plane,such as Cepheids, for which we can directly obtain distances.

According to Newtonian mechanics, if most of the masswere interior to the solar circle, the rotation curve should drop off as/Thetaœµ‚àùR‚àí1/2, a behaviorThe data for the Milky Way are supported by observations of other spiral galaxies, suchas those obtained by Vera Rubin and her collaborators in the late 1970s. Figure 26shows a spectrograph slit superimposed on NGC 2998, a galaxy in the constellation of UrsaMajor, 96 Mpc from Earth. Below that image is a portion of the spectrum in a wavelengthregion near HŒ±. The left side of the slit recorded blueshifted light, and the light on the rightside was redshifted. The Doppler shifts were then translated into radial velocities, and acorresponding rotation curve was determined.Similar rotation curves have also been measured for a number of other spiral galaxies (seeFig. 27). With the exception of the innermost regions (to be discussed in Section 4 forthe Milky Way), there is a rapid rise in rotation speed with distance out to a few kiloparsecsfrom the center. This type of rotation is referred to asrigid-body rotationbecause when/Thetaœµ‚àùR,/Omegaœµ=/Thetaœµ/Ris a constant and all stars have the same orbital period about the GalacticThe Milky Way Galaxy

we see that the mass density in the outer regions of the Galaxy must vary asœÅ(r)=V24œÄGr2.(50)Thisr‚àí2density dependence is very different from the form determined by star countsin the portion of the Galaxy beyond the solar Galactocentric radius. Recall from Eq. ( 14)that the number density of stars in the luminous stellar halo is believed to vary asr‚àí3.5,amuch more rapid drop-off than is evident from the Ô¨Çat rotation curve. It was this discrepancythat so surprised astronomers.As we mentioned at the end of Section 2, it appears that themajority of the mass in the Galaxy is in the form of nonluminous (dark) matter. Only throughits gravitational inÔ¨Çuence on the luminous component of our Galaxy and satellite galaxieslike the LMC and the SMC, and through gravitational lensing of light from backgroundsources, does the dark matter make its presence known.One modiÔ¨Åcation to Eq. ( 50) that has been made by many researchers is to force thedensity function to approach a constant value near the center, rather than diverge. Such amodel is also consistent with the observational evidence of rigid-body rotation. As a result,one commonly used density proÔ¨Åle for the Milky Way‚Äôs dark matter halo is assumed to beof the formœÅ(r)=œÅ01+(r/a)2,(51)whereœÅ0andaare chosen as parametric Ô¨Åts to the overall rotation curve. Note that forr‚â´a, ther‚àí2dependence is obtained, andœÅ‚àºconstant whenr‚â™a. A similar proÔ¨Åle isoften used for modeling other galaxies as well, with different choices forœÅ0anda.It is important to point out that Eq. ( 51) cannot be correct to arbitrarily large valuesofr. The reason for this is that the total amount of mass in the Galaxy would increasewithout bound sinceMr‚àùr. As a result, the density function for the dark matter halomust eventually terminate or at least decrease sufÔ¨Åciently rapidly that the mass integral/integraltext‚àû0œÅ(r)4œÄr2drremains Ô¨Ånite.An alternative form of the dark matter halo density distribution was proposed by JulioNavarro, Carlos Frenk, and Simon White in 1996. Using a commonly assumed form ofdark matter dynamics known ascold dark matter(CDM), Navarro, Frenk, and White rannumerical simulations of the formation of dark matter halos over a wide range of size andmass scales, ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. Their simulationsrevealed that a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù proÔ¨Åle of the formœÅNFW(r)=œÅ0(r/a)(1+r/a)2(52)was applicable over an enormous range with appropriate choices ofœÅ0anda(this is theproÔ¨Åle Ô¨Årst given by Eq. 15). The NFW density proÔ¨Åle behaves approximately like a1/r2proÔ¨Åle over much of the halo but is shallower (‚àº1/r) near the center and steeper(‚àº1/r3) near the edge of the halo. Even though the NFW proÔ¨Åle decreases more rapidlythan Eq. ( 51) with increasingr, it can be shown that the total mass contained within theThe Milky Way Galaxy

A Component Model of the Milky Way GalaxyBased on the mass density functions from star counts and kinematics, astronomers havebeen able to construct approximate models of the overall rotation curve of the Galacticdisk. One such model is shown in Fig. 28. Note that the observational data show thatthe rotation curve is decreasing slightly in the solar neighborhood (R0); hence the negativevalue ford/Thetaœµ/dR=‚àí(A+B)near the Sun. Although the model does not reproduce allof the Ô¨Åne structure that is present in the velocity data (which may be due to local densityvariations in the thin disk, such as spiral arms), the overall correspondence between themodel and observations is quite good. Notice in particular the rigid-body rotation near thecenter, the local maximum due to the combined effects of the central bulge, the stellar haloand the dark matter halo, and the eventual Ô¨Çat rotation at large values ofR.Some Methods for Determining DistancesBefore leaving the topic of Galactic kinematics, it is appropriate to discuss motion-basedmethods of determining distances within the Milky Way, the most important of which isthemoving cluster method. Since in a stellar cluster the stars are gravitationally bound toone another, they move through space collectively. By recording the changing positions ofmembers of the group over time due to the cluster‚Äôs bulk motion, it is possible to determinetheir directions of motion. After removing the effects of the Sun‚Äôs peculiar motion, tracing

In reality, other galaxies exist in our universe besides the Milky Way, and their mass density functions may overlap our own. As a result, although galaxies appear to be separate luminous objects, their dark matter halos may actually merge in intergalactic space.

This is simply the illusionthat parallel lines appear to converge at inÔ¨Ånity, a phenomenon familiar to anyone who haslooked down the length of a long, straight set of railroad tracks. A diagram of the motionof the Hyades galactic cluster, found in the constellation of Taurus, is shown in Fig. 29.From the geometry illustrated in Fig. 30, the angle between the cluster and the con-vergent point, as seen from the Sun, must be the same as the angle between the line ofsight to the cluster and its space velocity vector,v(this statement is valid only because theconvergent point is taken to be at inÔ¨Ånity).

By comparing theapparent magnitudes of other cluster H‚ÄìR diagram main sequences to the Hyades, it is pos-sible to Ô¨Ånd the distance moduli of those clusters, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 31.The Milky Way Galaxy
Assuming that the amount of interstellar extinction is known (from reddening data, for instance), the distances to those clusters can be determined. This distance technique is known as main-sequence Ô¨Åtting and is similar to the method of spectroscopic par-allax. However, main-sequence Ô¨Åtting is a more precise procedure because it relies on a large number of stars along the main sequence rather than on a single object, sig-niÔ¨Åcantly reducing statistical errors. Identifying RR Lyraes in clusters of known dis-tances then provides a means of determining the intrinsic luminosities of these stars more accurately. Once the luminosities of the RR Lyraes have been calibrated, they can be used to determine other distances, such as to globular clusters. Historically, the Hyades provided the foundation for virtually all distance estimates, both Galac-tic and extragalactic, beyond about 100 pc from Earth, although this is changing with

This larger baseline canthen be used to determine an average distance to the group of stars. However, it is importantto remember that the measured solar motion does depend on the group of stars used as areference. We will not discuss the details of the method in this text.4THE GALACTIC CENTERObservations of the center of our Galaxy pose a particular challenge. This is because theabundance of gas and dust in the Galactic plane results in more than 30 magnitudes ofextinction at visible wavelengths. Located only 30 pc above the midplane and 8 kpc fromthe center, the line of sight from the Sun to the center traverses nearly the maximumpossible amount of interstellar material. It is interesting to note, however, that because thesolar peculiar velocity has an appreciable component perpendicular to the Galactic plane(w‚äô=7.2 km s‚àí1), the Sun will reach a height of approximately 85 pc above theplane in15 million years;this will place it above most of the obscuring material.The Milky Way Galaxy
The ability to measure distances directly from the motion of Earth around the Sun relies on the 2-AU diameter of Earth‚Äôs orbit. If the length of the baseline could be increased, it would be possible to extend the method to objects farther away. This is accomplished by using the peculiar motion of the Sun with  respect to a group of stars having similar properties, such as similar spectral types, distanc-es, and space motions. The overall solar motion of 13.4 km s‚àí1 is equivalent to.

If humanity is still inhabiting Earth at that time, our descendants will enjoy a spectacularview of a dense stellar cluster near the center of our Galaxy.The Mass Distribution Near the Galactic CenterTo peer into the central regions of the Galaxy today, we are forced to make most of ourobservations in wavelengths longer than about 1¬µm (i.e., infrared, microwave, and radio),or in X-rays and gamma rays. Despite our difÔ¨Åculty of clearly seeing the center of theGalaxy in visible wavelengths, we have been able to construct an image of theGalacticnucleusthat depicts a history of violent events and exotic phenomena.One IR wavelength band commonly used for investigations of the core of our Galaxyis centered at 2.2¬µm, the so-calledKband. This wavelength band is employed becausethe large number of old Population I K and M giant stars (Te‚àº4000 K) that exist in thecentral region of the Galaxy are readily observable at 2.2¬µm. When we use theKband tostudy the brightness distribution of the central cluster and use an appropriate mass-to-lightratio (‚àº1M‚äô/L‚äô), it appears that the mass density of stars rises toward the center asr‚àí1.8down to a radius of between 0.1 pc and 1 pc. This is roughly the type of distribution thatwould be expected on dynamical grounds (the central region of the Galaxy is interior to theregion of ‚Äúrigid-body‚Äù rotation).Since these stars are very close together, particularly when compared with the distancebetween stars in the solar neighborhood, close encounters are fairly frequent, occurring onaverage once every 106years or so. Because of the gravitational perturbations producedby these close encounters, the constant exchange of mechanical energy between stars hasgenerated a nearlyisothermalvelocity distribution; in other words, the stars in the samplehave a velocity distribution just like the particles in an isothermal gas, meaning that thevelocity distribution is approximately Maxwellian. In a truly isothermalstellar gas, themass density distribution isr‚àí2, close to ther‚àí1.8variation that is observed. Recall thatthis is also the spherical density distribution required for Ô¨Çat rotation curves [when all starshave the same orbital velocity andMr‚àùr; Eq. ( 49)].The observed density distribution from the isothermal stellar gas is inconsistent withmeasurements of the velocities of stars within 2 pc of the center, however. Kristen Sellgren,Martina T. McGinn, and their colleagues made one such set of observations in the late1980s using the 2.3-¬µm molecular absorption band of CO found in the spectra of the coolK and M giants. They found that although the velocity distribution is fairly isothermal fromseveral hundred parsecs down to a couple of parsecs from the center, velocities begin toincrease signiÔ¨Åcantly as the distance to the center continues to decrease. This suggests thateither the stellar density must rise substantially faster thanr‚àí2toward the center (at leastas steeply asr‚àí2.7) or there must be a great deal of mass occupying a very small volumenear the middle of the cluster.More recently, Rainer Sch√∂del, Reinhard Genzel, and their research group were able tofollow the orbits of stars very close to the Galactic center. In particular, the star known asS2 has an orbital period of 15.2 yr, an orbital eccentricity ofe=0.87, and a perigalacticondistance of 1.8√ó1013m=120 AU (17 light-hours). This size is only a few times thesemimajor axis of Pluto‚Äôs orbit Figure 32 shows the orbit of S2 against the centralstellar cluster of the Galaxy.The Milky Way Galaxy

that are much greater than expected for normal stars. Furthermore, their ultravio-let Ô¨Çuxes are absorbed by the surrounding gas and dust and reradiated in the infrared. It has been suggested that these objects may be Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, which are extremely rare in other parts of the Galaxy. Since Wolf‚ÄìRayets are massive stars, they must have evolved to their present states very rapidly. If these stars are in fact Wolf‚ÄìRayets, then

For a discussion of an earlier version of this diagram, see Sch√∂del, et al.,Nature,419, 694,2002.)a burst of star formation must have occurred within the past 10 million years. However, anepisode of recent star formation seems to contradict the facts that the density of gas and dustis very low and that there is no evidence of ongoing star formation in that region today. Onthe other hand, in further support of the Wolf‚ÄìRayet idea is the presence of high-velocitygas near IRS 16 (‚àº700 km s‚àí1), which some researchers suggest may have been ejected asa stellar wind by one of the stars. As an alternative explanation, other astronomers point outthat it is also possible that the high-velocity gas could simply be falling in toward the centerof the Galaxy rather than being ejected from it.10The velocity structure of the gas does notappear to be consistent with the acceleration expected of Wolf‚ÄìRayet winds with increasingdistance from the star; instead, the gas velocity appears to decrease with distance.IRS 16 does not appear to have sufÔ¨Åcient mass to account for the rise in orbital ve-locities near the center. It seems that whatever the origin of this extremely localized massdistribution, it must have an overall luminosity that remains below our threshold of de-tectability. One possibility is that the mass is composed of a very dense cluster of browndwarfs and/or more massive neutron stars. Even in the case of neutron stars, however,10Determining whether the gas is falling in toward the center of the Galaxy or being ejected from it requiresinformation about the orientation of the gas trajectories relative to the line of sight, something that is often difÔ¨Åcultto determine.The Milky Way Galaxy

interactions with high-mass stars would eject the lower-mass neutron stars from the centerin less than 108years. This would have the additional effect that the most massive membersof the cluster would ‚Äúsink‚Äù to the center of the Galaxy‚Äôs gravitational well, which is notobserved.Radio Sources in SagittariusIt was Karl Jansky (1905‚Äì1950) who, in the 1930s, Ô¨Årst discovered that a radio source waslocated in the direction of Sagittarius, but extensive observations of the radio Galaxy weredelayed until after World War II.11Since that time the Galactic center has been the site ofnumerous studies at radio wavelengths.Radio observations of H I clouds reveal anuclear diskof neutral gas occupying a regionbetween a few hundred parsecs and about 1 kpc from the center. The disk appears to be tiltedslightly with respect to the Galactic plane and contains clouds with signiÔ¨Åcant noncircularmotions. Observations of the nuclear disk are responsible for the mass estimates of theGalactic center beyond 100 pc that are shown in Fig. 33.Galactic lobesof ionized gas have also been observed within the central few hundredparsecs. Elongated, with dimensions of 10 pc by 200 pc, the lobes are oriented nearlyperpendicular to the Galactic plane and may represent material being ejected from thecenter. However, the data may also be consistent with infalling material.One of the more unusual features of the radio emission originating in the central regionof the Galaxy is the set of Ô¨Ålaments that stretch for 20 pc from the center in a directionperpendicular to the Galactic plane and then make an almost right-angle turn; see Fig. 34.Even a casual inspection of this 20-cm radio structure, located near‚Ñì‚àº0.18‚ó¶, suggests thatmagnetic Ô¨Åelds may be responsible for the unusual pattern. In fact, the radiation is linearly

polarized and appears to be synchrotron emission. From the intensity of the radiation andthe amount of polarization, the strength of the Galactic magnetic Ô¨Åeld in that region isprobably between 10‚àí8and 10‚àí6T, roughly two to four orders of magnitude weaker thanEarth‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld.A similar feature has also been discovered south of the Galactic plane. Together, thesestructures seem to be part of a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù of streamers and Ô¨Ålaments that may correspond to massoutÔ¨Çow from the center of the Galaxy. A satisfactory model of the source of the relativisticelectrons that are spiraling around the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines, or of the source of the Ô¨Åeld itself,has not yet been developed.The inner 8 pc of the Galaxy contains the radio source designated asSagittarius A(Sgr A). With the increase in resolving power provided by the technique of very longbaseline interferometry and the use of telescopes such as the Very Large Array, it hasbecome possible to study the structure of the Sgr A complex down to angular resolutionsof 0.2 milliarcsecond, corresponding to linear dimensions of less than 2 AU.The largest feature of the complex is themolecular circumnuclear ring, a doughnut-shaped structure with an inner radius of 2 pc and an outer radius of 8 pc that is inclined some20‚ó¶with respect to the Galactic plane. The inner edge of the ring exhibits some warping,and the ring thickness increases from 0.5 pc at its inner edge to 2 pc at a Galactocentricdistance of 7 pc. This molecular ring has been observed at various wavelengths associatedwith several atoms and molecules, including H I, H2, C II, O I, OH, CO, HCN, and CS. Thering is rotating about the Galactic center at a speed of approximately 110 km s‚àí1, a valuethat is nearly independent of radius. From the collisional excitation of the molecules andthe intensity of the emission, the estimated mass of the portion of the ring located between 2and 5 pc is 1√ó104M‚äôto 3√ó104M‚äô.It is apparent that the ring is unlike any other molecular region known to exist in ourGalaxy. For instance, the temperatures of individual molecular clouds that exist throughoutmuch of the ring increase from less than 300 K near 4.5 pc to more than 400 K near theinner edge. At the same time, the number density of hydrogen molecules increases from1.5√ó1010m‚àí3to 5√ó1010m‚àí3over the same distance. These values should be comparedwith those of more typical molecular clouds, such as the giant molecular clouds discussedin Section 12.1. In GMCs that are located several kiloparsecs from the center of the Galaxy,T‚àº15 K andnH2‚àº108m‚àí3.The circumnuclear ring also shows evidence that some violent event occurred near theGalactic center in the relatively recent past. The inner edge of the ring is very sharp; the num-ber density of particles inside the central cavity is 10 to 100 times less than in the ringitself. Such a strong density discontinuity cannot be an equilibrium feature of the ringbecause the ring‚Äôs internal turbulence would destroy the discontinuity in less than 105years.Furthermore, the gas within the cavity is largely ionized while the gas in the ring is in theform of neutral atoms and molecules. It is estimated that the amount of energy required toclear out the cavity is on the order of 1044J, a value characteristic of a supernova explosion.The ring shows other evidence of some past violent episode as well. For instance, materialin the ring is very clumpy, a situation that cannot be maintained indeÔ¨Ånitely because of therelatively rapid smoothing effects of cloud‚Äìcloud collisions. Also, a study of the hydroxylmolecule (OH) in portions of the ring indicates that the temperature of nearly 2000 K isconsistent with strong shocks that rapidly heated the molecules to temperatures well aboveThe Milky Way Galaxy

the values seen elsewhere in the ring. Furthermore, OH radicals can be produced whenwater molecules (H2O) are torn apart by energetic events such as shocks.Besides the circumnuclear ring, several other components have also been discoveredwithin the Sgr A complex.Sgr A Eastis a nonthermal source with a shell-like appearance(a ‚Äúnonthermal‚Äù source is one thatdoes notemit its electromagnetic radiation in the formof a blackbody spectrum; one type of nonthermal emission is synchrotron radiation). It isgenerally accepted that Sgr A East is a young supernova remnant that may be between 100and 5000 years old.Sgr A West, which is located 1.5‚Ä≤from the center of Sgr A East, is anunusual H II region (a thermal source) that looks very much like a ‚Äúmini-spiral.‚Äù Finally,Sgr A‚ãÜ(pronounced ‚ÄúSagittarius A star‚Äù) is a strong, unresolved radio point source that islocated near the center of Sgr A West. A radio image of Sgr A West and Sgr A‚ãÜis shown inFig. 35(a).The location of the Sgr A complex corresponds very closely with the brightness peakof the central stellar cluster, suggesting strongly that this region marks the center of theGalaxy. In fact, one component of IRS 16 (named IRS 16 Center) is only about 1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤west ofSgr A‚ãÜ. If the two objects are the same distance from Earth and not simply aligned along theline of sight, then their angular separation translates into a linear separation of only 0.04 pc.For reasons we will soon discuss more fully, it now appears that Sgr A‚ãÜis the actual centerof the Milky Way.Although Sgr A West appears superÔ¨Åcially to be much like the large-scale spiral patternseen in the disk of the Milky Way, it is fundamentally very different.

110 km s‚àí1. The velocities recorded on the map in Fig. 35(b) are the measured radialvelocities. Portions of the arc that are moving nearly along the line of sight record the largestradial velocities (positive or negative), and the parts of the arc that are moving perpendicularto the line of sight have no radial-velocity components.The other components of Sgr A West appear to be ionized Ô¨Ålaments of matter that maybe both rotating about and falling in toward the central ‚Äúbar‚Äù and the vicinity near Sgr A‚ãÜ.These features may also be associated with a central magnetic Ô¨Åeld that has an estimatedstrength of 30 nT.As was seen for the stellar velocities, the velocities of the ionized gas within the cavityincrease dramatically toward the center, from 110 km s‚àí1at the inner edge of the circum-nebular ring to 700 km s‚àí1at 0.1 pc.Example 4.2.The motion of gas in the central regions of the Galaxy can be used toestimate the amount of mass interior to the location of the gas. A gas cloud 0.3 pc fromthe center has a measured velocity of 260 km s‚àí1. If the cloud is in orbit about the center,Eq. (49) givesMr=v2rG=4.7√ó106M‚äô.An X-Ray Source in Sgr ATo within the positional error bars, the radio Sgr A West region (including Sgr A‚ãÜ) alsocoincides with a small continuous X-ray source.Although the estimates are highly uncertaindue to extensive absorption along the line of sight, the X-ray source appears to have acharacteristic temperature ofT‚àº108K and luminosities of 1028W in the 2‚Äì6 keV energyband (‚Äúsoft‚Äù X-rays) and 2√ó1031W between 10 keV and 10 MeV (‚Äúhard‚Äù X-rays). Becausethe X-ray source is also highly variable, it must be composed of one or a few objects whosediameters are less than about 0.1 pc. The upper limit on the linear size is derived from theminimum amount of time required for information to travel across the object, assumingthat the information travels at the speed of light.

It has also been possible to place anupper limit of less than 2 AU on the size of Sgr A‚ãÜ. From these data, it appears that Sgr A‚ãÜcan only be asupermassive black holewith a mass ofMSgr A‚ãÜ=3.7¬±0.2√ó106M‚äô.The Milky Way Galaxy

This implies that the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole isRSgr A‚ãÜ=2GMbhc2=0.08 AU=16 R‚äô,which remains below the roughly 2-AU resolution limit of current observations.Producing the infrared radiation detected from the ring and maintaining the degree ofionization seen inside the cavity require an ultraviolet luminosity of 107L‚äôwith an effectiveblackbody temperature of 35,000 K; the temperature is deduced from the strengths of the IRemission lines of S IV , O III, and Ar III. The gas absorbs some of the UV radiation, ionizingit and producing the unusual H II region, Sgr A West. The dust absorbs the remainder ofthe UV photons and reradiates the light at IR wavelengths.Could a supermassive black hole be responsible for the luminosity? Observations of thenumber density of particles and the velocity structure inside the cavity of the circumnuclearring suggest that matter is accreting onto the Galactic center at a rate ofÀôM=10‚àí3to10‚àí2M‚äôyr‚àí1. This matter must release gravitational potential energy as its distance fromthe center decreases.It is possible to make a rough estimate of the luminosity that could be produced by anaccreting supermassive black hole in Sgr A‚ãÜ. If we consider a Newtonian view of energyreleased when a particle of massMspirals in through an accretion disk from an initialradius ofrito a Ô¨Ånal radius ofrf, then according to the virial theorem, the amount ofenergy radiated should be one-half the change in potential energy, orE=12/parenleftbiggGMbhMrf‚àíGMbhMri/parenrightbigg,whereMbhis the mass of the black hole. Assuming thatri‚â´rfandrf=RS(the Schwarz-schild radius), thenE=12GMbhMRS.Taking the luminosity asL=dE/dtand the mass accretion rate asÀôM=dM/dt, andsubstituting the expression for the Schwarzschild radius, we haveL=14ÀôMc2,(55)a result that is independent of both the mass and the radius of the black hole. Now, theminimum mass-accretion rate required to generate 107L‚äôisÀôM=4Lc2=1.7√ó1017kg s‚àí1=2.7√ó10‚àí6M‚äôyr‚àí1.The observed accretion rate of 10‚àí3to 10‚àí2M‚äôyr‚àí1is more than sufÔ¨Åcient to producethe luminosity seen in Sgr A West and Sgr A‚ãÜ. Curiously, high-resolution observations ofthe Sgr A‚ãÜregion alone suggests an upper limit of luminosity from Sgr A‚ãÜof less than3√ó104L‚äô.The Milky Way Galaxy

Assuming that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of Sgr A‚ãÜand that itis actually at the center of our Galaxy‚Äôs gravitational well, then it should remain nearlyFurthermore, relative to other objects in the Galactic center, Sgr A‚ãÜhas moved at mosta small fraction of its diameter over a period of more than a decade, a rate that is muchslower than for any other object in the region. Given the gravitational tugs that it certainlyreceives from stars and large clouds in that region, this extremely sluggish motion impliesthat Sgr A‚ãÜis very massive.Very high-resolution VLA maps at 2 cm reveal what appear to be large clouds of ionizedgas only 0.06 pc from Sgr A‚ãÜ. From the orientation of the clouds, it appears that they wereejected from the center in opposite directions. There is also evidence of a trail of hot, ionizedgas coming from IRS 7, a red supergiant star less than 0.3 pc from the center. The directionof the stream points away from Sgr A‚ãÜ, suggesting that a strong wind or perhaps intenseUV radiation from the center is blowing the material away from the star.As has already been mentioned, although the Galactic center appears relatively quiettoday, it must have experienced rather violent episodes in the recent past. One possiblemechanism that could produce these periodic events would be the tidal disruption of apassing star and the subsequent infall of matter. As the matter falls toward the supermassiveblack hole in the center, it collects onto an accretion disk, releasing a tremendous amountof gravitational potential energy accompanied by a dramatic increase in luminosityThe entire episode may last for only a few years, but if such events occurredon the order of every 104to 105years, enough energy would be released to keep the centralcavity ionized and the circumnuclear disk turbulent.Sgr A‚ãÜis not entirely inactive, however. From studies of the Galactic center using theChandra X-Ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton Observatory, it appears that Ô¨Çares occuron average about once per day. Lasting for up to an hour or so, luminosities can reach peakvalues of 3.6√ó1028W, more than 160 times the quiescent X-ray level of Sgr A‚ãÜ.Many other galaxies (Andromeda, for example) appear to have supermassive blackHigh-Energy Emission Lines from Near the Galactic CenterBefore leaving the discussion of the Galactic center, it is worth mentioning the detection oftwo signiÔ¨Åcant high-energy emission lines that originate in the region of the Sgr A complex.The Ô¨Årst of these results from an electron colliding with a positron, causing their mutualannihilation and the corresponding production of two photons, each of energy 511 keV .12Since it is believed that black holes can help produce positrons in the space surrounding12511 keV is the rest mass energy of an electron or a positron..The Milky Way Galaxymotionless. Studies that have attempted to measure the proper motion of Sgr   with respect to extremely distant extragalactic sources known as quasars indicate that to within the uncertainties in the measurements, Sgr   reÔ¨Çects only the peculiar motion of the Sun, just what would be expected for an object at rest at the center of the Galaxy.A‚ãÜA‚ãÜ

them, the presence of the 511-keV line seemed to support the existence of a black hole inSgr A‚ãÜ. However, the efÔ¨Åcient production of positrons in the numbers needed to explain theenormous Ô¨Çux of 1044photons per second (L511‚àº5√ó104L‚äô) requires a black hole smallerthan the one envisioned for the Galactic center (perhaps only a few hundred solar masses).This is because high accretion-disk temperatures are required for the production of theparticles, and the temperature of the disk increases with decreasing radius (see Eq. 18.19).Due to the poor angular resolution of the original detections, it was unclear whether SgrA‚ãÜcould properly be considered the source of the 511-keV photons. On October 13‚Äì14, 1990,the Soviet spacecraft GRANAT, with its higher-resolution imaging capability, discoveredthat the source of the 511-keV photons was not SgrA‚ãÜbut a previously known X-ray emitter,1E1740.7‚àí2942, Ô¨Årst detected by the Einstein satellite in 1979.13Nicknamed ‚Äúthe Einsteinsource,‚Äù 1E1740.7‚àí2942 is located some 45‚Ä≤from SgrA‚ãÜ, more than 300 pc from the center.With its accretion-disk plasma temperature of 109K and variable luminosity, the Einsteinsource appears to be a very strong candidate for a stellar black hole.The second high-energy emission line detected in the region of the Galactic center is the1.8-MeV line produced by the decay of2613Al to2612Mg. Since2613Al has a half-life of 716,000years and is produced only in relatively small amounts in supernovae, novae, and possiblyWolf‚ÄìRayet stars, the presence of an estimated‚àº5M‚äôof the radioactive isotope seems tosuggest that a large number of supernovae have occurred in that region over the past 105to106years. The Galactic center is clearly an extremely dynamic environment.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralHenbest, Nigel, and Couper, Heather,TheGuidetotheGalaxy, Cambridge University Press,Cambridge, 1994.Mateo, Mario, ‚ÄúSearching for Dark Matter,‚ÄùSky and Telescope, January, 1994.Oort, Jan, ‚ÄúExploring the Nuclei of Galaxies, Including Our Own,‚ÄùMercury, March/April,1992.Trimble, Virginia, and Parker, Samantha, ‚ÄúMeet the MilkyWay,‚ÄùSkyandTelescope, January,1995.Waller, William H., ‚ÄúRedesigning the Milky Way,‚ÄùSky and Telescope, September, 2004.TechnicalBenjamin, R.

Galactic Evolution1Interactions of Galaxies2The Formation of Galaxies1INTERACTIONS OF GALAXIESWith the exquisite vision of the heavens provided by modern ground-based and space-basedobservatories, it has become increasingly apparent that galaxies are not ‚Äúisland universes‚Äù;they do not evolve in isolation.Evidence of Interactions
Interactions tend to increase the velocity dispersions of stars in the galaxies involved,possibly destroying disk structures in late-type galaxies and causing the galaxies to relaxto early-typer1/4proÔ¨Åles.A VLA radio survey of the H I layer of galactic disks found that at least 50% of all diskgalaxies display warped disks. Also, more than half of all elliptical galaxies harbor discreteshells of stars.1Some disk warping may be due to tidal interactions with smaller satellitegalaxies, and, as we shall see, shells in ellipticals are signatures of mergers.galaxies is largely responsible for removing the gas from the individual galaxies that makeup the cluster, while still leaving the gas trapped in the cluster‚Äôs overall gravitational well.1See Binney (1992) and Barnes and Hernquist (1992) for further details on these statistics.From Chapter  of An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicsSecond Edition, Bradley W. Carroll, Dale A. Ostlie. Copyright ¬© 2007by Pearson Education, Inc. Published by Pearson Addison-Wesley. All rights reserved.26,Nearly all galaxies belong to clusters, and the galaxies take up a larger fraction of the cluster‚Äôs volume than do the stars in a stellar cluster.We also know that the spac-ing between galaxies is typically only 100 times larger than the size of the galaxies themselves. Densely populated clusters, such as the Coma cluster (Figs.  1 and  2), have a higher proportion of early-type galaxies (ellipticals) in their centers than they do in their outer, less dense regions. The central regions of these rich, regularly shaped clusters also have a higher proportion of early-type galaxies than the centers of less populated, amorphous-shaped irregular clusters, such as the Hercules cluster (Fig.  3). These observations seem to correlate with the increased probability of inter-actions and/or mergers between galaxies in regions of higher galaxy number density.Observations also suggest that hot, X-ray-emitting gas occupies much of the space between the galaxies in rich clusters and has a mass equal to or exceeding the mass of all of the cluster‚Äôs stars. It seems that the gravitational inÔ¨Çuence of interacting

Figure 4shows one of many examples of galactic interactions. In this section, we will examine suchobvious examples, as well as more subtle phenomena.Dynamical FrictionWhat happens when galaxies collide? Given that stars are generally spread very far apartin galaxies, the chance of even a single stellar collision is quite small.Instead, interactions between stars will be gravitational in nature. To see this, imagine thatan object (a globular cluster or small galaxy) of massMis moving through an inÔ¨Ånite col-lection of stars, gas clouds, and dark matter with a constant mass density,œÅ. We will assumethat the mass of each object in the background ‚Äúsea‚Äù of material is much less thanM,s oMcontinues moving in a straight line instead of being deÔ¨Çected. In the absence of colli-sions, it might be thought thatMwould move unimpeded. However, asMmoves forward,the other objects are gravitationally pulled toward its path, with the closest ones feelingthe largest force. As shown in Fig. 5, this produces a region of enhanced density alongthe path, with a high-density ‚Äúwake‚Äù trailingM. The result, known asdynamical friction,is a net gravitational force onMthat opposes its motion. Kinetic energy is transferred fromMto the surrounding material asM‚Äôs speed is reduced.Galactic Evolution
This evidence suggests that interactions between galaxies play an important role in their evolution. In the hierarchical ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù scenario of galaxy formation to be described in the next section, large galaxies are thought to be formed by merg-ers and the gravitational capture of smaller entities. In this view, the interactions seen

The derivation of an expression for dynamical friction is beyond the scope of this text,but it is easy to see that the physical quantities involved are the mass,M, and speed,vM,of the massive object, and the mass density of the surrounding material,œÅ. As a result,the expression for the force must containGM,vM, andœÅonly.2It is left as a problem toshow that there is only one combination of these variables that has the units of force, so theexpression for the force of dynamical friction,fd, must look likefd‚âÉCG2M2œÅv2M,(1)whereCis dimensionless. Here,Cis not a constant, but a function that depends on howvMcompares with the velocity dispersion,œÉ, of the surrounding medium. ForvM‚àº3œÉ,typical values ofCare 23 for the LMC, 76 for globular clusters, and 160 for ellipticals.3Through a careful examination of Eq. ( 1), it is possible to see why the various termsenter as they do. Clearly the dynamical friction must be proportional to the mass densityof stars. Assuming that the relative numbers of objects of various masses do not change,doublingœÅmeans doubling the total number of objects, which would in turn double thegravitational force onM. The massMitself is squared; one power comes from its role inproducing the high-density wake that trails behind it, and the other from the gravitationalforce onMproduced by the enhanced density. Finally, consider the velocity-squared termin the denominator. IfMmoves twice as fast, it will spend only half as much time neara given object, and so the impulse/integraltextFdt=/Delta1pgiven to that object is only half as great.Consequently, the density enhancement develops only half as rapidly, andMwill be twiceas far away by the time the enhancement arises. Thus thev2Min the denominator comesfrom the inverse-square law of gravity. This last point means that slow encounters are muchmore effective at decreasing the speed of an intruding mass.To get an estimate of the timescale associated with the effects of dynamical frictionacting on a galaxy‚Äôs globular clusters, recall that Ô¨Çat rotation curves imply that the densityof the dark matter halo may be approximated most simply by,œÅ(r)=v2M4œÄGr2.Inserting this expression into Eq. ( 1), we Ô¨Ånd that the dynamical friction acting on acluster isfd=CG2M2œÅ(r)v2M=CGM24œÄr2.If the cluster‚Äôs orbit is circular and of radiusr, its orbital angular momentum is justL=MvMr. Since dynamical friction acts tangentially to the orbit and opposes the cluster‚Äôs2Because the only time thatMarises is in connection with Newton‚Äôs law of gravity, the combinationGMwill beinseparable in any derivation.3You may refer to Binney and Tremaine (1987) for a detailed discussion of dynamical friction.Galactic Evolution

If the age of M31 is approximately13 Gyr, then Eq. ( 3) implies thatrmax=3.7 kpc. This means that globular clusters of5√ó106M‚äôthat were originally within approximately 4 kpc of the center of Andromedawould have spiraled into its nucleus by now.According to Eq. ( 3),rmax‚àùM1/2, implying that clusters with masses greater than5√ó106M‚äôcould have been gathered from greater distances. This may help to explainwhy there are no very massive globular clusters remaining around M31 today.This is a fate that has already befallen the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, the remnantof the dwarf galaxy in Canis Major, and possibly a progenitor dwarf galaxy ofœâCentauri.

The process of satellite accretion has a variety of possible consequences. For instance,the gravitational torques involved in the merger of a satellite galaxy in a retrograde orbitmay produce the counter-rotating cores that are observed in some elliptical galaxiesRapid EncountersWe now turn to another type of encounter, one that occurs so rapidly between two galaxiesthat their stars do not have time to respond. Even in the special case where the two systemspass through one another, there is no signiÔ¨Åcant dynamical friction because there is noappreciable density enhancement. In thisimpulse approximation, the stars barely have timeto alter their positions. As a result, the internal potential energy,U, of each galaxy isunchanged by the collision. However, the gravitational work that each galaxy performs onthe other has increased the internal kinetic energies of both galaxies in a random way. Thisinternal kinetic energy comes at the expense of the overall kinetic energies of the galaxies‚Äômotions with respect to one another. The amount of internal energy gained by the galaxiesdepends on the nearness of the approach of the galaxies involved, with the energy decliningrapidly for more distant encounters. (Roughly, the energy gained is inversely proportionalto the fourth power of the distance of closest approach of the galaxies.)Suppose that one of the galaxies gains some internal kinetic energy during the interaction.To determine how it will respond, assume that the galaxy was initially in equilibrium,meaning that it satisÔ¨Åed the virial theorem prior to the encounter,and its initial kinetic, potential, and total energies were related by 2Ki=‚àíUi=‚àí2Ei.Imagine that during the encounter, the galaxy‚Äôs internal kinetic energy increased fromKitoKi+/Delta1K. Because its potential energy has remained essentially constant, the galaxy‚Äôstotal energy has increased toEf=Ei+/Delta1K. As a result, the galaxy has been thrown outof virial equilibrium. When equilibrium is Ô¨Ånally reestablished (after a timescale of a feworbital periods), the Ô¨Ånal kinetic energy must, according to the virial theorem, beKf=‚àíEf=‚àí(Ei+/Delta1K)=Ki‚àí/Delta1K.Thus, as equilibrium is regained, the internal kinetic energy of the galaxy actuallydecreasesby 2/Delta1Kfrom the value it had just after the collision.How does the galaxy accomplish this reduction? One way to regain equilibrium is toconvert the excess kinetic energy into an increased (less negative) gravitational potentialenergy. The galaxy expands slightly as the separation between its masses increases. Anotherway of reducing the kinetic energy is for the most energetic components to carry it out awayfrom the galaxy in the form of a stream of stars and gas. This evaporation cools the galaxyand moves it toward a new equilibrium. In fact, both of these processes may occur, and whichone dominates is determined by the speciÔ¨Åc circumstances of the collision. For instance,a high-speed, nearly head-on collision may produce aring galaxy, such as the Cartwheelshown in Fig. 6. A numerical computer simulation and interpretation of this interactionare left as an exercise.Galactic Evolution.In a disk galaxy, merg ers may excite global modes of oscillation. Mergers are also  capable of producing the sort of featureless disks that are characteristic of Ir (amor-phous) galaxies. The importance of mergers in the evolution of galaxies will be  explored in Section 2.

It is not clear which of the two galaxies at right may have been the intruder. [Courtesy ofKirk Borne (STScI), and NASA.]If two galaxies are gravitationally bound to one another, they will eventually merge,given enough time. Because of their extended mass distributions, galaxies do not follow thesame trajectories they would if they were point masses; some orbital energy is diverted intoincreasing the galaxies‚Äô internal energy, and the orbit shrinks a bit. Tidal forces may alsodissipate the orbital energy by pulling stars and gas out of one or both galaxies, a processknown astidal stripping. This is probably the cause of the Magellanic Stream.An instructive way of thinking about this loss of galactic material involves using theidea of gravitational equipotential surfacesAlthough the Ô¨Ågure is for point masses in a circular orbit, it contains valuable insights forthe present case of extended galaxies in noncircular orbits. In particular, it is useful to talkabout thetidal radii,‚Ñì1and‚Ñì2, of the galaxies. They are the distances from the center ofeach galaxy to the inner Lagrangian point,L1, given by (approximately, in this noncircularthe gravitational potential well. (This is analogous to a star overÔ¨Çowing its Roche lobeAs a result, the density of galactic material undergoes a sharpdeclinebeyond the tidal radius.Polar-ring galaxiesanddust-lane ellipticalsare normal galaxies that are orbited byrings of gas, dust, and stars that were stripped from other galaxies as they passed by ormerged.

If the relative speed of the galaxiesis substantially greater than the velocity dispersions of their stars, the collision will notresult in a merger. Conversely, if the relative speed of the collision is less than the velocitydispersion of the stars in one of the galaxies, a merger is inevitable. The situation is partic-ularly complicated when the relative velocity of the galaxies is comparable to the velocitydispersion of stars in one of the galaxies. This situation is best studied today by numericalexperiments involvingN-body simulations, like the ones that were used to investigate theGalactic Evolution

bar instability in a disk of stars. In these computations, Newton‚Äôs second lawis used tofollow the motions of the stars through a sequence of time intervals.4One of the Ô¨Årst such efforts was made in 1972 by Alar and Juri Toomre. Each galaxyconsisted of a massive nucleus surrounded by concentric rings of disk stars. To simplifythe calculations, the stars in the disk were allowed to feel the gravitational pull of thegalactic nuclei, but not of each other. With their program, the Toomre brothers succeededin demonstrating how interactions could explain the appearance of galaxies such as M51(the Whirlpool), which has a bridge of stars and gas that appears to extend to its neighborin Fig. 11. It is remarkable that the rapid advances in computing power since the early1970s now allow a program similar to the Toomres‚Äô to be run on a personal computer.In general, only close, slow encounters produce bridges and tails. The effect is mostpronounced when the orbital angular speed of one of the galaxies matches the angularspeed of some of the stars in the other galaxy‚Äôs disk. The resulting orbital resonance, whichacts on both the near and far sides of the disk, allows the tidal forces to be especiallyeffective. Two bulges tend to develop on opposite sides of one (or both) of the galaxies,similar to Earth‚Äôs tidal bulges. Tidal stripping then pulls out streams of stars and gas asthe two galaxies pirouette around one another. When conditions are right, the stars and gastorn from the near side will form an apparent bridge, while, because of angular momentumconservation, the material stripped from the far side moves off to form a curving tail.Modern computer codes include the effects of dark matter and the gravitational inter-actions (self-gravity) of individual stars and gas clouds. Figures 12 and 13 show theresults of one such calculation that has reproduced the appearance of the tidal-tail galaxiesNGC 4038 and NGC 4039. These codes have also been used to simulate the merger of adisk galaxy (with a central bulge and halo) and a satellite galaxy with 10% of the mass ofthe primary. The presence of a dark-matter halo signiÔ¨Åcantly decreases the timescale of amerger because it allows the galaxies to interact over much larger distances. The satelliteis devoured and absorbed in only two revolutions of the disk galaxy.and vary little in age, while the outer population has a wider age spread. The inner clustersalso tend to have a preferential direction for their orbits around the Galaxy, while the outerclusters have randomly oriented orbits. Again, it appears likely that these outer clustersformed elsewhere and were captured later by the Milky Way. In fact, some researchers4In 1941, Holmberg used ananalog computerto investigate the tidal interactions of galaxies. He made ‚Äúgalaxies‚Äùout of light bulbs and used the inverse-square law of light to mimic the same behavior for gravity. With the aid ofa light meter, he was able to analyze the gravitational inÔ¨Çuence of one model galaxy on another.Galactic Evolution

In addition, the Toomres were successful in reproducing the appearance of  tidal-tail galaxies, such as the pair NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 (the ‚ÄúAntennae‚Äù) shown
It is worth recalling that roughly one-half of the stars in the Milky Way‚Äôs outer stellar halo move in retrograde orbits, which is probably a consequence of tid-al stripping and/or mergers of other dwarf galaxies. There are two different spatial distributions of globular clusters around the Milky Way. The inner clusters are old

More than 50% ofgalactic disks (including the Milky Way‚Äôs) display a warp in their gas distributions (althoughsome stars may participate in the warp as well), and most of these galaxies do not appearto have nearby companions. The absence of a companion might argue in favor of a merger,under the assumption that the companion was enveloped by the primary galaxy. However,most disks show no explicit evidence that a merger has occurred. It has also been shownthat warped disks can arise simply as a consequence of the triaxial nature of the surroundingdark halos. The importance of the role of mergers or close encounters in producing warpeddisks has yet to be determined.Galactic Evolution

(Figure adaptedfrom Barnes,Ap. J.,331, 699, 1988.)starburst galaxiesare extremely bright at infrared wavelengths, pouring out up to 98% oftheir energy in this portion of the spectrum. (In comparison, the Milky Way emits 30% ofits luminosity in the infrared, and M31 only a few percent.) Most of the star formation isconÔ¨Åned to within about one kiloparsec or so of the galaxy‚Äôs center, where radio telescopeshave detected vast clouds containing some 109to 1012M‚äôof hydrogen gas that serves asfuel. Between 10 and 300 M‚äôof gas is converted into stars each year in a starburst galaxy,while only two or three stars are formed annually in the Milky Way. The clouds typicallycontain sufÔ¨Åcient hydrogen to support this rate of star formation for about 108to 109years,although a given burst may last for only 20 million years or so.The observational evidence also shows that starbursts do not occur exclusively in thenuclei of interacting galaxies. Although this is often the case, many disk-wide starburstsare also known. In this case, the problem is how star formation can be triggered nearlysimultaneously over such a wide area.Since hydrogen clouds were initially distributed throughout the galactic disk, one puzzlefacing astronomers is how a violent interaction with another galaxy could have removedmore than 90% of the clouds‚Äô angular momentum, allowing the gas to become concentratedin the galactic center. An answer may be provided by numerical simulations of collidinggalaxies. These studies indicate that the gas and stars react differently to the impact of anintruding galaxy, with the gas tending to move out in front of the stars as they orbit thegalactic center. The stars‚Äô gravity then pulls back on the gas, and the resulting torque on thegas reduces its angular momentum, causing it to plunge toward the galactic center. As thetwo galaxies begin to merge, more angular momentum is lost. Shock fronts then compressthe gas, and a burst of star formation begins.Figure 14 shows the starburst galaxy M82/NGC 3034, about 3.2 Mpc awayFrom its unusual appearance, astronomers once thought that this galaxy wasexploding. The current interpretation is that between 107and 108years ago, the inner 400 pcof M82 began a tremendous episode of star formation that is still continuing.

All of this violent activity may have beentriggered by a tidal interaction with M81, a spiral galaxy that is now about 36 kpc awayfrom M82 (as projected on the plane of the sky) and linked to it by a gaseous bridge ofneutral hydrogen. In fact, the center of M81 is known to be a signiÔ¨Åcant source of X-rays,with an X-ray luminosity ofLX=1.6√ó1033W. This has been interpreted as implyingthat M81 has a central black hole that is being ‚Äúfed‚Äù by infalling gas at the rate of 10‚àí5to10‚àí4M‚äôyr‚àí1. This gas infall may also be a consequence of the tidal interaction with M82.Mergers in Elliptical and cD GalaxiesThe importance of interactions in galactic evolution is most obvious for elliptical galaxies.The case is especially compelling for the cD galaxies typically found at the centers of rich,regular clusters. More than half of the known cD‚Äôs have multiple nuclei that move differentlythan the galaxy as a whole. Although the typical orbital speed of a star in a cD galaxy is‚àº300 km s‚àí1, the multiple nuclei move with relative velocities of‚àº1000 km s‚àí1. All ofthis is taken as evidence that cD galaxies are the products of galactic mergers that suppliedthe supernumerary nuclei and the expansive halo of stars. Their frequent occurrence at thebottom of a cluster‚Äôs gravitational potential well makes collisions and other close encountersall the more probable. Figure 15 is a remarkable photograph of three smaller galaxiespassing through a cD at the center of the cluster Abell 2199. (In this case their velocities areGalactic Evolution
so large that these galaxies will not be captured during this passage through the cD.) cD‚Äôs also have unusually high speciÔ¨Åc frequencies of globular clusters, suggesting that a large number of clusters have been captured throughout the evolution of a typical cD galaxy.Normal elliptical galaxies show evidence of interactions and mergers as well, particularly the boxy E‚Äôs. About 25% of all ellipticals have very different veloc-ity Ô¨Åelds in their cores when compared with their outer regions. Observations

Calculations of mergers can also reproduce theobservations of distinctly different velocity Ô¨Åelds inside and outside the galactic core.It is important to note, however, that dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals, the mostcommon types of elliptical galaxies, do not appear to result from mergers.Binary Supermassive Black HolesAn intriguing consequence of the merging of two large galaxies, whether they are ellipticalsor spirals, is the apparently inevitable formation of a binary system of supermassive blackholes. If each galaxy involved in the merger originally contained a supermassive black hole,the two black holes would migrate toward the center of the potential well of the combinedsystem as a direct result of dynamical friction. Depending on their trajectories, the two blackholes would probably enter into a well-separated binary system. One such system appearsto be NGC 6420, which has two very strong X-ray sources (believed to be supermassiveblack holes) that are currently separated by a distance of about 1 kpc (see Fig. 17).

As the two supermassive black holes orbit around one another, they will have a profoundand disturbing time-dependent gravitational inÔ¨Çuence on stars near the center of the mergedgalaxy. As with other three-body systems where one member is much less massive thanthe other two, it is probable that individual stars will be ejected from the central region ofthe galaxy. If the total mass of stars ejected in this way becomes comparable to the massof the black holes, enough angular momentum and energy will be carried away by thestars that the two black holes will spiral in toward one another. When the black holesbecome sufÔ¨Åciently close, they will produce large amounts of gravitational radiation thatwill further rob them of the energy and angular momentum needed to stay separatedTheÔ¨Ånal outcome of the process will be a merger of the two black holes, producing anevenlarger beast in the center of the merged galaxy.It has been suggested that such a mechanism is a probable route to growing the super-massive black holes that seem to be so prevalent in the centers of large galaxies.2THE FORMATION OF GALAXIESAs we have seen so far in our discussions of the Milky Way and other galaxies, galacticstructures are complex and varied. The luminous components of elliptical galaxies are dom-inated by spheroidal mass distributions that are primarily composed of old stars, while spiralgalaxies contain both relatively old spheroids and appreciable disks of younger generationsof stars, dust, and gas. Important differences even exist within the designations of early-and late-type galaxies, such as the degree of diskiness or boxiness of normal ellipticals, theexistence of dwarf spheroidals, and the relative dominance of the bulges and disks of spirals,to name a few. Furthermore, the presence of large quantities of dark matter, accounting for90% or more of the mass in many galaxies, also plays a critical role in determining theiroverall structures.The Eggen, Lynden‚ÄìBell, Sandage Collapse ModelIt was in 1962 that Olin J. Eggen (1919‚Äì1998), Donald Lynden-Bell, and Allan R. Sandagepresented an important early attempt at modeling the evolution of our Galaxy, often referredto as theELS collapse model. Their work was based on observed correlations between themetallicity of stars in the solar neighborhood, and their orbital eccentricities and orbitalangular momenta. Eggen, Lynden-Bell, and Sandage noted that the most metal-poor starstend to have the highest eccentricities, the largestwcomponents of their peculiar motionsTo explain the kinematic and chemical properties of stars in the solar neighborhood,ELS suggested that the Milky Way Galaxy formed from the rapid collapse of a large proto-Galactic nebula. The oldest halo stars formed early in the collapse process while still onnearly radial trajectories, resulting in their highly elliptical orbits above and below theGalactic plane.As a further consequence of their rapid formation, the model predicts that thehalo stars are naturally very metal-poor (Population II) since the interstellar medium had notGalactic Evolution

yet had time to become enriched by the by-products of stellar nucleosynthesis. However, asthe Ô¨Årst generations of massive stars generated heavier elements in their interiors, underwentsupernova explosions, and ejected metal-rich material back into the ISM, the ISM evolvedchemically over time.As the proto-Galactic cloud continued to fall inward, the model predicts that the rapidcollapse slowed when collisions between gas and dust particles became more frequent andthe kinetic energy of infall was dissipated (converted into the thermal energy of randomparticle motions). Furthermore, the presence of angular momentum in the original proto-Galactic nebula meant that the cloud began to rotate more quickly as the radius decreased.The combination of the increased dissipation and the increased angular speed led to thedevelopment of a disk of chemically enriched gas from which Population I stars continueto form today.Example 2.1.The time required for the free-fall collapse of the proto-Galactic cloudas envisioned by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, and Sandage can be estimatedAssume that the proto-Galactic cloud containedsome 5√ó1011M‚äô, the estimated mass of the Milky Way Galaxywithin a nearly sphericalvolume of radius 50 kpc (which includes the dark matter haloIf we further assume that the mass was uniformly distributed over the sphere,then the initial density of the cloud wasœÅ0=3M4œÄr3=8√ó10‚àí23kg m‚àí3.Substituting intogivestff=/parenleftbigg3œÄ321GœÅ0/parenrightbigg1/2=200 Myr.Of course, if the nebula were initially somewhat centrally condensed, the inner portions ofthe Galaxy would collapse more rapidly than the outer, rareÔ¨Åed regions.This may explain the existence of the very old stellar population within the bulge. Thehigh metal abundance of bulge stars would arise if the Ô¨Årst, massive, short-lived stars couldquickly enrich the relatively dense ISM in that part of the Galaxy. Recall that the lifetimes ofthe most massive stars are on the order of one million years, much shorter than the estimatedfree-fall timescale.Problems with the ELS ModelAlthough the model does account for many of the basic features found in the structure ofthe Milky Way, thistop-downapproach involving the differentiation of a single, immenseproto-Galactic cloud does not explain several important aspects of our current understandingof the Galaxy‚Äôs morphology. For instance, given an initial rotation of the proto-Galacticcloud, essentially all halo stars and globular clusters should be moving in the same generaldirection, albeit with highly eccentric orbits about the Galactic center. However, astronomershave come to realize that approximately one-half of all outer-halo stars are in retrogradeGalactic Evolution

stars and clusters seems to suggest that the early environment of the Galaxy was fairlyturbulent and clumpy.)A second problem with the standard ELS collapse model is the apparent age spreadamong the globular clusters and halo stars. If the approximately 2-billion-year variation in8 Gyr old, whereas the age of the thick disk may be 10 Gyr (both being signiÔ¨Åcantly youngerthan the halo).Yet another difÔ¨Åculty lies in the compositional variation found between globular clusters.The clusters located nearest the Galactic center are generally the most metal-rich and oldest,while the clusters in the outer halo exhibit a wider variation in metallicity and tend to beyounger. The clusters also seem to form two spatial distributions; one set is associated withthe spheroid, and the other may more properly be afÔ¨Åliated with the thick disk.The problems that have developed with the early ELS view of the formation of theMilky Way suggest that our understanding of its formation and subsequent evolution mustbe revised or is otherwise incomplete. Furthermore, the rich variety of galaxies, along withtheir ongoing dynamical evolution via mutual interactions and mergers, poses interestingchallenges to the development of an overall, coherent theory of galactic evolution.Althoughat the time this text was written, such a theory had not yet reached the same level ofmaturity that exists in our understanding of stellar evolution, important features have begunto emerge.The Stellar Birthrate FunctionAs we have seen in the ELS model, any theory of galaxy formation must be able to explainthe rate of formation of stars of various masses, as well as the chemical evolution of theinterstellar medium. Since the ISM is enriched by mass loss via stellar winds and supernovaeof various types, the theory must also incorporate the rates of stellar evolution and thechemical yields of stars.One problem immediately arises in this regard: Although astronomers have been ableto develop a reasonable description of the evolution of individual stars, our understandingof stellar birthrates is not yet complete. It is customary to express thestellar birthratefunction,B(M, t), in terms of thestar formation rate(SFR),œà(t), and theinitial massfunction(IMF),Œæ(M), in the formB(M, t) dM dt=œà(t) Œæ(M) dM dt,(4)whereMis the stellar mass andtis time.B(M, t)represents the number of stars per unitvolume (or per unit surface area in the case of the Galactic disk) with masses betweenMandM+dMthat are formed out of the ISM during the time interval betweentandt+dt. The SFR describes the rate per unit volume at which mass in the ISM is beingGalactic Evolutionorbits and the net rotational velocity of the outer halo is roughly 0 km s‚àí1. On the other hand, stars in the inner halo, along with the inner globular clusters, appear to  have  a small net rotational  velocity.  (Our  current  understanding  of  the  kinematics  of  haloages is real (the age range being perhaps 11 to 13 Gyr), then the collapse must have taken roughly an order of magnitude longer to complete than proposed by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, and Sandage. The model also does not readily explain the existence of a multicomponent disk having differing ages. The young disk is probably about

One computersimulation of the evolution of the disk of our Galaxy, performed by Andreas Burkert, JamesW. Truran, and G. Hensler (1992), produced an SFR that reached a maximum value and thendecreased with time as the available gas and dust in the ISM was consumed (see Fig. 18).Other studies have considered the possibility that the SFR may be highly variable in bothspace and time. Such a situation could occur because of short-timescale starburst activity,for instance.The IMF is often modeled as a power-law Ô¨Åt of the formŒæ(M)=dNdM=CM‚àí(1+x),(5)wherexmay take on different values for various mass ranges andCis a normalizationconstant. The Ô¨Årst attempt to derive an IMF for the solar neighborhood was carried out byEdwin E. Salpeter in 1955, where he argued for a value ofx=1.35. According to morerecent determinations, it appears thatx=1.8 may be a better Ô¨Åt for stars in the approximatemass range 7 M‚äôto 35 M‚äô(and perhaps down as low as 2 M‚äô). For stars more massive thanabout 40 M‚äô,x=4 may be required, implying that the production of massive stars dropsGalactic Evolution

off very rapidly with increasing mass. For lower-mass stars,xis very difÔ¨Åcult to determinethrough observational studies. The complications arise because the IMF must be decoupledfrom thepresent-day mass functionand the SFR, which itself can be quite complicated.It has been suggested that the IMF may Ô¨Çatten considerably at low masses. Unfortunately,an exact form of the IMF is not yet known, and it is not even clear whether the IMF varieswith time or location.The G-Dwarf ProblemAttempts to use the SFR and IMF to model the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk in thesolar neighborhood have resulted in predictions that do not always agree with observations.If we assume that the Ô¨Årst generation of stars was born without any metals (Z0=0; Popu-lation III) and the chemical evolution of the ISM occurs within aclosed box(meaning thatno gas or dust is allowed to enter or leave the system being modeled), then the calculationspredict too many stars of low metallicity when compared with observations. For instance,this simple model suggests that roughly one-half of the stars in the solar neighborhoodshould have values forZthat are less than one-quarter of the solar value (Z‚äô‚âÉ0.02).However, only about 2% of the F and G main-sequence stars have such lowZvalues. Thisis known as theG-dwarf problem.One possible solution to the G-dwarf problem, referred to asprompt initial enhance-ment, is to assume that the disk of our Galaxy formed withZ0Ã∏=0, which could occur ifheavy-element enrichment of the ISM resulted from rapidly evolving massive stars beforethe gas and dust settled into the disk. A second suggestion is that the disk accumulated massover a signiÔ¨Åcant period of time, perhaps even continuing to the present (in other words, theclosed-box assumption is invalid). In this scenario a substantial infall of metal-poor materialonto the Galactic disk has occurred since its initial formation; as the gas entered the system,it mixed with the metal-enriched ISM. Since a lower initial mass density would imply fewerstars formed during the early history of the disk, fewer metal-poor stars would be observedtoday. Yet another proposal argues that the IMF was different in the early history of theGalaxy, and a larger fraction of more massive stars were formed with correspondingly fewerlow-mass stars. Since massive stars are short-lived, this hypothesis would result in fewermetal-poor stars today.A Dissipative Collapse Modelcollapse can be described in terms of the time necessary for the nebula to cool signiÔ¨Åcantly.If thecooling timescale,tcool, is much less than the free-fall timescale, then the cloud will notbe pressure-supported and the collapse will be rapid (i.e., essentially in free-fall). However,if the cooling time exceeds the free-fall timescale, the gas cannot radiate its energy away fastenough to allow for a rapid collapse, and the gravitational potential energy that is releasedduring the collapse will heat the nebula adiabatically. This situation is yet another exampleof the virial theorem.Galactic Evolution
Another issue that must be addressed by a comprehensive theory of galactic evo-lution is the question of a free-fall collapse versus a slow, dissipative one. A free-fall collapse is governed by the free-fall timescale, sometimes alternatively referred to as the dynamical timescale (see Example  2.1). On the other hand, a dissipative

To estimate the cooling timescale, we must Ô¨Årst determine the characteristic amount ofthermal kinetic energy contained within each particle in the gas. According to the virialtheorem, if we assume that the gas is in quasistatic equilibrium, the average thermal kineticenergy of the gas must be related to its potential energy by,‚àí2‚ü®K‚ü©=‚ü®U‚ü©.If we further assume that the gas has a mean molecular weight of¬µand containsNparticles,then the virial theorem gives‚àí2N12¬µmH/angbracketleftbigv2/angbracketrightbig=‚àí35GM2R,wherem=¬µmHis the average mass of a single particle,Ris the radius of the nebula,andM=N¬µmHis the nebula‚Äôs mass.

The number density of particles in the gas is given byn=œÅ¬µmH=3M4œÄR3¬µmH‚àº5√ó104m‚àí3.This value should be compared to the typical number densities found in Galactic molecularclouds today, which are on the order ofn‚àº108to 109m‚àí3.Now, from Fig. 19,/Lambda1‚àº10‚àí36Wm3and the cooling time for the cloud (Eq. 8)is found to betcool=8 Myr.Clearly, in this casetcool‚â™tff. Apparently the proto-Galactic nebula was capable ofradiating energy away at a rate sufÔ¨Åcient to allow for a free-fall collapse.It is instructive to consider the situation wheretcool>tff. In this case the nebula is unableto efÔ¨Åciently radiate away the gravitational potential energy that is released by the collapse.As a result, the cloud‚Äôs temperature would rise adiabatically as the cloud shrinks, resultingin an increasing internal pressure and a halt to the collapse. After the collapse has halted,the virial theorem governs the equilibrium conditions of the cloud. For the approximatevalues ofT‚àº106K andn‚àº5√ó104m‚àí3characteristic of a protogalactic cloud at thetime of formation of the Ô¨Årst galaxies, the upper limit on the mass that can cool and collapseis on the order of 1012M‚äô, with a corresponding radius of about 60 kpc. In regions of thecloud where the gas temperature had decreased to the level of hydrogen recombination,T‚àº104K, the mass limit becomes‚àº108M‚äô. Thus the galaxies that are observed todaywould be expected to have masses in the range from 108M‚äôto 1012M‚äô. The lower limitcorresponds fairly well with the values of the smallest dwarf elliptical galaxies, and the upperlimit agrees with the values measured for the most massive giant spiral galaxies (Sa‚ÄìSc).Although some giant ellipticals and cD galaxies exceed 1012M‚äô, they have certainly beenaffected signiÔ¨Åcantly by mergers throughout their histories and are not in virial equilibriumnear their outer edges.Although the proto-Galactic cloud was able to radiate away the initial release of grav-itational energy content from the system, shortly after the collapse began a new source ofenergy became available. The deaths of the Ô¨Årst generations of very massive stars meantthat supernova shock waves moved through the ISM at speeds on the order of 0.1c.A sthe expanding shells struck the gas, the gas was reheated to temperatures of a few millionkelvins, slowing the rate of collapse somewhat. However, calculations of the supernovaproduction rate that are based on estimates of the IMF seem to indicate that even this newsource of energy was unable to slow the collapse appreciably.The Hierarchical Merger ModelHow then can we explain the apparent age and metallicity differences among the globularclusters, as well as the existence of distinct components of varying ages within the disk ofour Galaxy (i.e., the thick disk and the younger thin disk)? The answer appears to be thatnot only did galaxy-building involve the top-down process originally envisioned by Eggen,Lynden-Bell, and Sandage, but it also incorporated abottom-uphierarchical process ofmergers.Galactic Evolution

With the realization in the 1970s and 1980s that mergers play an important role in galacticevolution, and because of observational and theoretical developments regarding the natureof the early universe, the hierarchical merger scenario has received a great deal of attention.Scientists now believe that shortly after the birth of the universe via the Big Bang, densityÔ¨Çuctuations existed in the overall distribution of matter.Our current understanding of thoseÔ¨Çuctuationssuggests that the most common density perturbations occurred on the smallestmass scales. Consequently, density Ô¨Çuctuations involving 106to 108M‚äôwere much morecommon than those for 1012M‚äôor more.First consider the formation of the Milky Way as an example of the hierarchical mergerprocess. As these 106to 108M‚äôproto-Galactic fragments were gravitationally attractedto one another, they began to merge into a growing spheroidal mass distribution. Initially,many of the fragments evolved in virtual isolation, forming stars and, in some cases, globularclusters in their centers. As a result, they developed their own chemical histories and uniqueabundance signatures. In the inner regions of the growing spheroid, where the density ofmatter was greater, its rate of collapse and subsequent evolution would have been morerapid. This resulted in the production of the oldest stars that are observed today, togetherwith a greater degree of chemical enrichment (hence the old, metal-rich central bulge). Inthe rareÔ¨Åed outer regions of the Galaxy, chemical evolution and star formation would havebeen much slower.According to the hierarchical model, collisions and tidal interactions between mergingfragments disrupted the majority of the fragments and left exposed the globular cluster coresof others. Furthermore, in this model the disrupted systems would have led to the presentdistribution of the Ô¨Åeld halo stars, while leaving the remaining globular clusters scatteredthroughout the spheroid. Those proto-Galactic fragments that were initially moving in aretrograde direction relative to the eventual orbital motion of the Galactic disk and innerhalo produced the net zero rotation of the outer halo that is observed today.Certainly the rate of collisions would have been greater near the center of the Galaxy,disrupting those proto-Galactic fragments Ô¨Årst and building the bulge more rapidly than thehalo. Consequently, according to this picture, the spheroidal component of the Galaxy canbe considered as forming from the inside out.The globular clusters still present in the Galaxy today probably total only some 10% of thenumber that originally formed from proto-Galactic fragments. The other 90% were disruptedby collisions and tidal interactions during the early merger process and by the subsequentongoing effects of dynamical friction. This may help to explain the relative uniformity inthe masses of globular clusters observed today (approximately 105to 106M‚äô). Low-massglobular clusters would have had small gravitational binding energies, allowing them tobe disrupted comparatively easily and rapidly when the Galaxy was young. On the otherhand, recall from Eq. ( 1) that dynamical friction is strongly dependent on the mass ofthe cluster (fd‚àùM2) so that massive clusters would have spiraled rapidly into the innerregions of the Galaxy where stronger and more frequent interactions ultimately disruptedthem as well.It is important to note that because of their isolation in the outer reaches of the Galaxy andthe slower rate of evolution there, the proto-Galactic fragments in that region would haveevolved almost like individual dwarf galaxies for a time. In fact, the signiÔ¨Åcant number ofdSph galaxies still present in the Local Group are assumed to be surviving proto-GalacticGalactic Evolution

fragments. In addition, there is clear evidence of ongoing mergers today, such as the dwarfspheroidal Sagittarius galaxy and the Magellanic Stream, indicating that the constructionof the Milky Way‚Äôs halo is still a work in progress.Formation of the Thick DiskAs the gas clouds of disrupted proto-Galactic fragments collided, the collapse becamelargely dissipative. This means that the gas began to settle slowly toward the central regionsof the Galaxy. However, because of the presence of some initial angular momentum inthe system, introduced through torques from other neighboring protogalactic clouds, thecollapsing material eventually became rotationally supported and settled into a disk aboutthe Galactic center. Of course, the already-formed halo stars did not participate in thecollapse to the disk, because their collisional cross sections were now too small to allowthem to interact appreciably, except through gravitational forces.One model of thick-disk formation suggests that the thick disk may have formed aroundthe Galactic midplane with a characteristic temperature ofT‚àº106K. By equating thekinetic energy of a typical particle in the gas to its gravitational potential energy above themidplane of the disk, the approximate scale height,h, of the disk of gas can be estimated.To determine the local acceleration of gravity,g, at a height,h, above the midplane,imagine that the disk has a mass density,œÅ, given byœÅ(h)=œÅ0e‚àíz/h,whereœÅ0is the mass density in the Galactic midplane.Now, according to thegravitationalversion of ‚ÄúGauss‚Äôs law‚Äù,/contintegraldisplayg¬∑dA=‚àí4œÄGMin,where the integral is over a closed surface that bounds the massMin, andgis the localacceleration of gravity at the position ofdA.I fhis much smaller than the diameter of thedisk, then for a Gaussian cylinder of height 2hand cross-sectional areaA, centered on themidplane (see Fig. 20),2Ag=4œÄGMin,whereMinis the amount of disk mass contained within the cylinder.Mincan be estimatedby integrating the mass density throughout the volume of the cylinder, orMin=2/integraldisplayh0œÅ0e‚àíz/hAdz=1.26œÅ0Ah.Substituting into our previous expression, we have that the local acceleration of gravity ata height,h, is given byg(h)=2.53œÄG œÅ0h.Galactic Evolution

by hydrogen atoms. This meant that once the hydrogen recombination temperature wasreached, H I clouds could form and begin producing stars. Within a few million years,the most massive stars underwent core-collapse supernova detonations and their shocksbegan to reheat the gas between the molecular clouds, maintaining the temperature of theintercloud gas at roughly 106K. At the same time, the production of iron in the supernovaeraised the metallicity from an initial value of[Fe/H]<‚àí5.4 (perhaps originally enrichedsomewhat by the stars that formed in the proto-Galactic fragments) to[Fe/H]=‚àí0.5.About 400 million years after the Ô¨Årst stars were created in the thick disk, star formationnearly ceased. In total, a few percent of the mass of the gas was converted into stars duringthis thick-disk-producing period of the Galaxy‚Äôs evolution.A modiÔ¨Åed version of the thick-disk formation model described above suggests thatthe infalling gas was initially much cooler. This meant that the gas (and dust) was ableto settle onto the midplane with a much smaller scale height, similar to today‚Äôs thin disk.Star formation was then able to proceed due to the greater local density of gas and dust.However, as a direct result of a signiÔ¨Åcant merger event with a proto-Galactic fragmentsome 10 Gyr ago, the disk was reheated by the energy of the interaction, causing it to puffup to its present 1-kpc scale height.Formation of the Thin DiskAfter the formation of the thick disk, cool molecular gas continued to settle onto the midplanewith a scale height of approximately 600 pc. During the next several billion years, starformation occurred in the thin disk.The process of maintaining the scale height was essentially a self-regulating one. If thedisk became thinner, its mass density would increase. This in turn would cause the SFR toincrease, producing more supernovae and reheating the disk‚Äôs intercloud gas component.The ensuing expansion of the disk would again decrease the SFR, yielding fewer super-novae, and the disk would cool and shrink. However, despite the self-regulating process,as the gas was depleted in the ISM the SFR decreased from about 0.04 M‚äôpc‚àí3Myr‚àí1to 0.004 M‚äôpc‚àí3Myr‚àí1. At the same time, the metallicity continued to rise, reaching avalue of approximately[Fe/H]=0.3. Because of the decrease in the SFR, the thicknessof the disk decreased to about 350 pc, the scale height of today‚Äôs thin disk. During thedevelopment of the thin disk, some 80% of the available gas was consumed in the form ofstars.Finally, as the remaining gas continued to cool, it settled into an inner, metal-rich andgas-rich component of the thin disk with a scale height of less than 100 pc. Today mostongoing star formation occurs in this young, inner portion of the thin disk, the componentin which the Sun resides.The Existence of Young Stars in the Central BulgeThe existence of young stars in the central bulge of our Galaxy can be understood in thecontext of the evolution just described by arguing for recent mergers with gas-rich satellitegalaxies. When those galaxies were disrupted by tidal interactions with the Milky Way,their gas settled into the disk and the center of the Galaxy, ultimately forming new stars. Italso appears that the Milky Way‚Äôs central bar plays a role in the migration of dust and gasinto the inner portion of the Galaxy by generating dynamical instabilities as it rotates.Galactic Evolution

Metallicity GradientsThe hierarchical merger scenario just outlined predicts that metallicity gradients ought toexist in galaxies that have undergone a dissipative collapse. If a galaxy is more metal-richin its center than it is near the outskirts of the system, then a color gradient should alsoexist. Because of the enhancement of opacity with metallicity,the galaxywould be redderin its center than it is farther out.Of course, the strength of the metallicity and color gradients can be diminished or evendestroyed by sufÔ¨Åciently frequent and energetic mergers with other galaxies. For instance,many starburst galaxies actually have inverted color gradients and appear bluer in theircenters. This is because of the large SFR that resulted from the sudden inÔ¨Çux of gas-richmaterial in the galactic center when another galaxy was disrupted, or from the effects oftidal torques that acted on the starburst galaxy itself, causing its own gas to spiral into thecenter. It is worth noting that weaker metallicity gradients are observed in boxy ellipticalsthan in disky ones, another possible indication that boxy E‚Äôs have undergone signiÔ¨Åcantmerger activity during their lifetimes.The Formation of Elliptical GalaxiesAlthough we do not yet understand all of the complex details of galactic evolution, the natureof the Hubble sequence may ultimately correspond to the mass of the individual galaxies,the efÔ¨Åciency with which the galaxies made stars, and the relative importance of free-fallcollapse, dissipative collapse, and mergers. As an example, it appears that many ellipticalsmay have formed the majority of their stars early in the galaxy-building process, before thegas had a chance to settle into a disk, whereas late-type galaxies took a more leisurely pace.You may also recall that current observations indicate that later Hubble types have a higherrelative abundance of gas and dust in their disks than galaxies of earlier Hubble typeHowever, as Ô¨Årst mentioned at the end of Section 1, other E‚Äôs probably formed fromthe collisions of already-existing spirals. The energy involved in the collision would destroythe disks of both galaxies and cause the merged system to relax to the characteristicr1/4distribution of an elliptical.AlthoughN-body simulations have been able to produce such a result (see Fig. 21),some questions remain. For instance, the large number of globular clusters in E‚Äôs relative tospirals present a serious difÔ¨Åculty in arguing that cataclysmic collisions are the cause of allthat many of the observed globular clusters are captured dwarf spheroidal galaxies, just asœâCen appears to be in the Milky Way.From the discussion at the beginning of Section 1, recall that elliptical galaxies aremuch more abundant relative to spirals in the centers of dense, rich clusters of galaxies,whereas spirals dominate in less dense clusters and near the periphery of rich clusters. (Thismorphology‚Äìdensity relationwas Ô¨Årst reported by Alan Dressler in 1980.) This effect maybe partly explained by the increased likelihood of interactions in regions where galaxiesare more tightly packed, destroying spirals and forming ellipticals.Galactic Evolution

large elliptical galaxies. On the other hand, perhaps mergers can actually produce globular clusters by triggering star formation in clouds, in which case the larg-er speciÔ¨Åc frequency of globular clusters may not be a problem. It is also possible

The result is an elliptical galaxy with anr1/4proÔ¨Åle. (Figure adapted from Hernquist,Ap. J.,409, 548, 1993.)However, a competing hypothesis has also been suggested‚Äînamely, that ellipticals tendto develop preferentially near the bottoms of deep gravitational potential wells, even in theabsence of interactions. Lower mass-density Ô¨Çuctuations in the early universe may have re-sulted in spiral galaxies, and the smallest Ô¨Çuctuations led to the formation of dwarf systems.If this is the case, then the large number of dSph‚Äôs and dE‚Äôs that exist has a natural expla-nation in the much larger number of smaller Ô¨Çuctuations that formed in the early universe.This mechanism could help explain galactic morphology if the initial density Ô¨Çuctuationsin the early universe were largest in what later became the centers of rich clusters. Becausethe gravitational potential well in those regions would have been deeper, the probability ofcollisions between protogalactic clouds should have been correspondingly greater as well.Galactic Evolution

Perhaps the frequency of collisions between protogalactic clouds is correlated with galaxymorphology.Galaxy Formation in the Early UniverseGiven the large number of fundamental problems that still remain in our development of acoherent theory of galaxy formation, it is fortunate that a means exists (at least in principle)for testing our ideas by observing galactic evolution through time. Because of the Ô¨Ånitespeed of light, when astronomers look farther and farther out into space, we are literallylooking farther and farther back in time. For instance, galaxies that are 1 Mpc away emittedtheir light more than 3 million years ago. This means that the light we observe today comingfrom the galaxy is itself more than 3 million years old; we are ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the galaxy 3 millionyears in the past.In 1978, Harvey Butcher and Augustus Oemler, Jr., noted that there appeared to be anoverabundance of blue galaxies in two distant clusters. They speculated that there may havebeen a signiÔ¨Åcant evolution in galaxies over time, leading to the types of objects we seecloser to us today. TheButcher‚ÄìOemler effect, as it is now called, suggests that galaxies inthe early universe were bluer on average than they are today, indicating an increased levelof star formation. The effect has been conÔ¨Årmed in numerous recent studies.The morphology‚Äìdensity relation has also been shown to be time-dependent. As obser-vations probe earlier times (more distant galaxy clusters), elliptical, and lenticular galaxiesbecome less abundant relative to spiral galaxies, suggesting an evolution from later Hub-ble types to earlier types over time. This is just what would be expected if some earlierHubble-type galaxies form from the mergers of spirals. This is also consistent with theoverall picture of hierarchical galaxy building.In 2004, the Space Telescope Science Institute released the Hubble Ultra Deep Field(HUDF) image shown in Fig. 22. The HUDF image is actually a composite of twoimages, one taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the other from theNear-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). The region of the skycontained in the HUDF image is only 3 arcmin on a side (about 1/10 the size of the fullmoon), centered on (Œ±=3h32m40.0s,Œ¥=‚àí27‚ó¶48‚Ä≤00‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) in the constellation of Fornax. Theimage required a total exposure time of 11.3 days for ACS (obtained between September24, 2003, and January 16, 2004) and 4.5 days for NICMOS (over the period betweenSeptember 3, 2003, and November 27, 2003).The HUDF reveals some very distant galaxies as they existed just 400 Myr to 800 Myrafter the Big Bang.As is evident in the close-up of a portion of the HUDF shown in Fig. 23,the very distant galaxies appear quite different from the relatively nearby majestic spiralsand ellipticals that are seen in the present-day universe.Observations like these suggest that the abundance of strange-looking, remote, bluegalaxies seen in the early universe may be the building blocks of today‚Äôs Hubble sequenceof galaxies. They probably represent the proto-galactic fragments responsible for the hier-archical mergers that are still occuring today at a much diminished rate.Certainly a great dealGalactic Evolution

The diameters of these galaxies are  comparable to the distance  between our Galaxy and Andromeda, so each of these giant ellipticals is nearly the size of the entire Local Group.M87, a giant E1 elliptical, is the largest and brightest galaxy in the Virgo clus-ter. Like many other luminous elliptical galaxies, it contains roughly 1010 M‚äô of hot ( 107 K) gas that has accumulated through normal stellar mass loss mechanisms. The gas loses energy by the free‚Äìfree emission of X-ray photons. This thermal bremsst-rahlung process produces a characteristic spectrum that can be readily identiÔ¨Åed‚àº

One  result  for  M87  shows  that  Mr increases  linearly with  radius  out  to  about  300  kpc. This is the same signature seen for the distribution of dark matter in spiral gal-axies. The total mass contained within r = 300 kpc is Mr ‚âÉ 3 √ó 1013 M‚äô, with a cen-tral density of 1.5 √ó 10‚àí2 M‚äô pc‚àí3. The corresponding mass-to-light ratio is M/L ‚âÉ 750 M‚äô/L‚äô.

to the virial theorem, the cluster‚Äôs galaxies would have been moving more slowly, thereby increasing the dynamical friction and the chance of a merger. The large amounts of intra-cluster gas found in many rich clusters were probably ejected during these early galactic interactions, or by bursts of star formation. Once this process was under way, it would have been enhanced by ram-pressure stripping. When a galaxy moves at several thousand kilometers per second through the intracluster gas, it encounters a furious wind that is capable of stripping its gas away.

The Virgocentric peculiar velocity is a minor perturbation in a much larger scale in-homogeneity in the Hubble Ô¨Çow. There is a large-scale streaming motion (rela-tive to the Hubble Ô¨Çow) that carries the Milky Way, the Local Group, the Virgo clus-ter, and thousands of other galaxies through space in the direction of the constellation Centaurus. The peculiar velocity of the Local Group relative to the Hubble Ô¨Çow is

Active Galaxies1Observations of Active Galaxies2A UniÔ¨Åed Model of Active Galactic Nuclei3Radio Lobes and Jets4Using Quasars to Probe the Universe1OBSERVATIONS OF ACTIVE GALAXIESThe story of modern astrophysics is one of a dynamically evolving universe. On every scale,from planets to stars to galaxies, the objects that are present in this era differ from whatthey were during previous epochs. As we study the ancient light that arrives from distantcorners of the universe, we are able to examine how galaxies looked and behaved in theiryouth. These observations reveal a level of activity in the centers of young, remote galaxiesthat is rarely found in nearer galactic nuclei.Seyfert GalaxiesThe Ô¨Årst hint of the violent heritage of today‚Äôs galaxies was found by EdwardA. Fath (1880‚Äì1959), who in 1908 was observing the spectra of ‚Äúspiral nebulae.‚ÄùAlthough most showed anabsorption-line spectrum produced by the combined light of the galaxy‚Äôs stars, NGC 1068displayed six bright emission lines. In 1926 Edwin Hubble recorded the emission lines ofthis and two other galaxies. Seventeen years later Carl K. Seyfert (1911‚Äì1960) reported thata small percentage of galaxies have very bright nuclei that are the source of broad emissionlines produced by atoms in a wide range of ionization states. These nuclei are nearly stellarin appearance.Today these objects are known asSeyfert galaxies, with spectra that are categorizedinto one of two classes.Seyfert 1galaxies have very broad emission lines that include bothallowed lines (H I, He I, He II) and narrower forbidden lines (such as [O III]).1Seyfert 1galaxies generally have ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù allowed lines as well, although even the narrow lines arebroad compared to the spectral lines exhibited by normal galaxies. The width of the lines isattributed to Doppler broadening, indicating that the allowed lines originate from sourceswith speeds typically between 1000 and 5000 km s‚àí1, while the forbidden lines correspondto speeds of around 500 km s‚àí1.Seyfert 2galaxies have only narrow lines (both permitted1orbidden lines involve low-probability transitions in atoms and are an indicationof low gas densities.From Chapter  of An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicsSecond Edition, Bradley W.

Every spectrum also showsa featureless continuum that is devoid of lines, originating from a small central source. Thegreat luminosity of a Seyfert 1 galaxy arises from this continuum, which often overwhelmsthe combined light of all of the galaxy‚Äôs stars. The continuum observed for a Seyfert 2 issigniÔ¨Åcantly less luminous.Figures 1 and 2, respectively, show the visible spectra of Mrk 1243 (a Seyfert 1)and Mrk 1157 (a Seyfert 2), where ‚ÄúMrk‚Äù indicates an entry in the galaxy catalog of E. B.Markarian (1913‚Äì1985), produced in 1968. Some spectra display both broad and narrowpermitted lines, and so they are classiÔ¨Åed as an intermediate type such as Seyfert 1.5.However, it is important to emphasize that this is a spectral classiÔ¨Åcation. The spectra ofa few Seyfert galaxies have changed nearly from type 1.5 to type 2 in a matter of years,although the broad HŒ±emission line has rarely if ever completely disappeared.The galaxies known to emit the most X-ray energy are Seyferts of types 1 and 1.5. TheX-ray emission is quite variable, and can change appreciably on timescales ranging fromdays to hours. In contrast, X-rays are less frequently measured for Seyfert 2 galaxies. Ananalysis of the hard X-rays that are observed for Seyfert 2s indicates that the ‚Äúmissing‚ÄùX-rays have been absorbed by intervening material with huge hydrogen column densities2of between 1026and 1028m‚àí2.Seyferts make up only a few tenths of a percent of all Ô¨Åeld galaxies. It is interesting thatat least 90% of the Seyferts close enough to be resolved by telescopes are spiral galaxies,typically of types Sb or SBb. They are frequently accompanied by other galaxies with which2ine proÔ¨Åles can be used to calculate the column density of the absorbing material.Active Galaxies

The mostnotable feature of thisspectral energy distribution(SED) is its persistence over some10 orders of magnitude in frequency. This wide spectrum is markedly different from thethermal (blackbody) spectrum of a star or the combined spectra of a galaxy of stars.When AGNs were Ô¨Årst studied, it was thought that their spectra were quite Ô¨Çat. Accord-ingly, a power law of the formFŒΩ‚àùŒΩ‚àíŒ±(1)was used to describe the monochromatic energy Ô¨Çux,FŒΩ.3Thespectral index,4Œ±, wasbelieved to have a value ofŒ±‚âÉ1.The power received within any frequency interval betweenŒΩ1andŒΩ2isLinterval‚àù/integraldisplayŒΩ2ŒΩ1FŒΩdŒΩ=/integraldisplayŒΩ2ŒΩ1ŒΩFŒΩdŒΩŒΩ=ln 10/integraldisplayŒΩ2ŒΩ1ŒΩFŒΩdlog10ŒΩ,(2)so that equal areas under a graph ofŒΩFŒΩvs. log10ŒΩcorrespond to equal amounts of energy;hence the reason for plotting log10ŒΩFŒΩon the ordinate in Fig. 4.

the continuum. The spectral index typically has a value between 0.5 and 2 that usuallyincreases with increasing frequency, so the curve of log10ŒΩFŒΩvs. log10ŒΩin Fig. 4 isgenerally concave downward. In fact, the value ofŒ±is constant over only a limited rangeof frequencies, such as in the infrared and visible regions of the spectrum. The shape andpolarization of the visible-UV spectrum indicates that it can sometimes be decomposed intocontributions from thermal sources (blackbody spectrum, low polarization) and nonthermalsources (power-law spectrum, signiÔ¨Åcant polarization). The thermal component appears asthebig blue bumpin Fig. 4, which can contain an appreciable amount of the bolometricluminosity of the source. It is generally believed that the emission from the big blue bumpis due to an optically thick accretion disk, although some researchers have suggested thatfree‚Äìfree emission may be responsible. Also evident is a thermalinfrared bumpto the leftof the big blue bump; it is probably due to emission from warm (T/lessorsimilar2000 K) dust grains.A pure power-law spectrum (with constantŒ±) is the signature of synchrotron radiation,which is frequently encountered in astronomical situations involving relativistic electronsandmagneticÔ¨Åelds.AsshowninFig.5,asynchrotronspectrumisproducedbythecombinedradiationemittedbyindividualelectronsastheyspiralaroundmagneticÔ¨Åeldlines.Ifthedistributionoftheindividualelectronenergiesobeysapowerlaw,thentheresultingsynchrotronspectrumisdescribedbyEq.(1).However, the synchrotron spectrum does not continue to rise without limit as the frequencydecreases.

indexŒ±=‚àí2.5). This occurs because the plasma of spiraling electrons becomes opaqueto its own synchrotron radiation, an effect known assynchrotron self-absorption.In some SEDs, the ‚Äúturnover‚Äù evident in the schematic continuum spectrum in Fig. 4may be due to synchrotron self-absorption. However, the thermal contributions to the con-tinuum spectrum evident in the infrared bump suggest that in other cases, the turnovermay be due to the long-wavelength Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans portion of the blackbody spectrumproduced by the warm dust grains. It is possible that the steeper, low-frequency spectraof radio-quiet AGNs are due to the thermal spectrum of dust grains, while the shallower,low-frequency spectra of radio-loud AGNs may be due to a combination of thermal andnonthermal emission.Radio GalaxiesAfter World War II the science of radio astronomy that was started by Karl Jansky maderapid progress, led by astronomers in Australia and England. The Ô¨Årst discrete source ofstrong radio waves (other than the Sun) was discovered in the constellation Cygnus andwas named Cygnus A (a modern VLA radio image of Cyg A is shown in Fig. 6). Usingthe accurate position provided by English radio astronomer F. Graham Smith, the team ofWalter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski (1895‚Äì1976) was able to Ô¨Ånd the optical counterpartof Cyg A. It is a peculiar-looking cD galaxy whose center is apparently encircled by a ringof dust (Fig. 7 shows an optical image of Cyg A obtained using the Hubble SpaceTelescope).

This is several million times more radio energy than isproduced by a normal galaxy such as M31 and is roughly three times the energy producedatallwavelengths by the Milky Way.Like Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies may also be divided into two classes:broad-lineradio galaxies(BLRGs, corresponding to Seyfert 1s) andnarrow-line radio galaxies(NLRGs, corresponding to Seyfert 2s). BLRGs have bright, starlike nuclei surrounded byvery faint, hazy envelopes. NLRGs, on the other hand, are giant or supergiant ellipticalgalaxies (types cD, D, and E); Cyg A is a NLRG.Despite their similarities, there are obvious differences between Seyferts and radio galax-ies. Although Seyfert nuclei emit some radio energy, they are relatively quiet at radio wave-lengths compared with radio galaxies. Furthermore, while nearly all Seyferts are spiralgalaxies, none of the strong radio galaxies are spirals.Radio Lobes and JetsA radio galaxy may display extendedradio lobes, as in Fig. 6, or it may radiate its energyboth from a compactcorein its nucleus and from ahalothat is about the size of the visiblegalaxy or larger. The optical cD galaxy in Fig. 7 is the central dot in the Cyg A radioimage shown in Fig. 6. The optical galaxy is Ô¨Çanked by two huge radio lobes that arethe sources of the tremendous radio luminosity estimated in Example 1.1. Each of thelobes has a diameter of about 17h‚àí1kpc.Observations reveal that one of the lobes is connected to the central galaxy of Cyg Aby a collimatedjetthat spans the roughly 50h‚àí1kpc of space separating the galaxy fromthe lobe. (Since the orientations of jets and radio lobes are not well determined, the valuesfor their sizes quoted here are projected distances on the plane of the sky.) At least halfof the stronger radio galaxies have detectable jets, as do more than three-quarters of theweaker sources. The jets associated with the powerful sources tend to be one-sided (likeCyg A‚Äôs), while those found in less luminous radio galaxies are typically two-sided. Onereason for this is that the stronger radio galaxies can be seen at greater distances, and so adim counterjet may go undetected. (Reasons why counterjets may not appear as luminousto the observer will be discussed in Section 3.)Figure 8 shows the strong jet and weak counterjet of the elliptical galaxy NGC 6251at several radio frequencies. Note that the Moon‚Äôs angular diameter would just Ô¨Åt into eitherof the two rectangular boxes at the top of the Ô¨Ågure, while the scale of the bottom box isjust a few milliarcseconds across. It is remarkable that the jet can be traced essentially allthe way to the core of the galaxy.Other radio jets are not as straight as those of Cyg A or NGC 6251. Figure 9 shows thewindblown appearance of the jets emanating from NGC 1265, produced by that galaxy‚Äôsmotion through the intracluster gas of the Perseus cluster.Active Galaxies

In 1960Thomas Matthews and Allan Sandage were searching for an optical counterpart to anotherradio source, 3C 48. They found a 16th-magnitude starlike object whose unique spectrumdisplayed broad emission lines that could not be identiÔ¨Åed with any known element ormolecule. In Sandage‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúThe thing was exceedingly weird.‚Äù In 1963 a similarlyweird spectrum was found for another radio source with a stellar appearance, 3C 273.Figure 12 shows 3C 273 and its jet, which extends a projected distance of 39h‚àí1kpcfrom the nucleus.Active Galaxies

(Adapted from a Ô¨Ågure courtesy ofPalomar/Caltech.)3C 48, 3C 273, and other, similar sources were classiÔ¨Åed asquasi-stellar radio sources(QSRs), which became known asquasars. But names are not a substitute for understanding,and an understanding of quasars proved to be elusive. Later that year, the mystery liftedsomewhat when Dutch astronomer Maarten Schmidt recognized that the pattern of thebroad emission lines of 3C 273 was the same as the pattern of the Balmer lines of hydrogen.These familiar lines had been severely redshifted (z=0.158) to unfamiliar wavelengths,making their identiÔ¨Åcation difÔ¨Åcult; see Fig. 13. This Doppler shift means that 3C 273is receding from Earth at 14.6% of the speed of light. According to Hubble‚Äôs law, thisplaces 3C 273 at a distance of about 440h‚àí1Mpc.

Greenstein (1909‚Äì2002) and Thomas Matthews calculated that 3C 48 has an even greaterredshift,z=0.367, corresponding to a radial velocity of 0.303cand a Hubble distance ofjust over 900h‚àí1Mpc. Astronomers realized that 3C 48 was one of the most distant objectsyet discovered in the universe.Quasar LuminositiesA quasar‚Äôs radio emission may come either from radio lobes or from a central source inits core. Quasars are so far away that in optical images most appear as overwhelminglybright, starlike nuclei surrounded by faint fuzzy halos. In some cases, a fuzzy halo can beresolved into a faint parent galaxy. To be visible from such great distances, quasars must beexceptionally powerful.Example 1.2.quation can be used to obtain the absolutevisualmagnitudeof the quasar 3C 273, which has an apparent visual magnitude ofV=12.8[h]WMAP=0.71 yields a distance ofd‚âÉ620 Mpc, implying thatMV=V‚àí5 log10/parenleftbiggd10 pc/parenrightbigg=‚àí26.2.This value can be used to obtain an estimate of the luminosity of the quasar at visualwavelengths.

The radio spectrum follows the power law of Eq. ( 1)with a spectral index ofŒ±‚âÉ0.24.

This implies that the mostluminous quasars are on the order of 105times more energetic than a normal galaxy likeour own Milky Way.Quasar SpectraThe monochromatic Ô¨Çux of 3C 273 is shown in Fig. 14. This continuous spectrum spansnearly 15 orders of magnitude in frequency, very broad compared with the sharply peakedblackbody spectrum of a star.

The two lines on the right correspondto 3C 273 during quiescence and during an outburst. (Figure adapted from Perry, Ward, and Jones,MNRAS,228, 623, 1987.)from its core.) For most other quasars, the spectrum at the low-frequency end falls off moreabruptly (smallerŒ±). A typical spectrum turns over in the far infrared at a frequency ofabout 5√ó1012Hz, possibly due to dust and/or synchrotron self-absorption. Also, althoughsome quasars are most luminous at infrared wavelengths and others peak in X-rays, thepeak power output of 3C 273 is in the form of low-energy gamma rays.Quasars emit an excess of ultraviolet light relative to stars and so are quite blue inappearance. For example, the color indices of 3C 48 areU‚àíB=‚àí0.61 andB‚àíV=0.38(you should note that this lies well above the positions of main-sequence stars on thecolor‚Äìcolordiagram.InFig.14,thisultravioletexcessisindicatedbythebigbluebump between roughly 1014Hz and 1016Hz. A big blue bump is a feature of most (but notall) quasar spectra.Absorption lines may also be present in some quasar spectra. In particular, Doppler-broadened absorption lines, found in up to 10% of the spectra of quasars, originate fromsources with speeds exceeding 104km s‚àí1.

Quasi-Stellar ObjectsThe distinctive appearance of quasars, starlike with an excess of ultraviolet light, led as-tronomers to search for more objects Ô¨Åtting this description. In fact, choosing those objectswithU‚àíB<‚àí0.4 results in a nearly complete list of possible quasars (those at veryhighzare redder), which must then be conÔ¨Årmed by a spectroscopic analysis. Researchersdiscovered that about 90% of the conÔ¨Årmed quasar candidates, and AGNs in general, arerelatively radio-quiet. For this reason, most of these objects are technically referred to asquasi-stellar objects(QSOs), rather than quasars (QSRs).Quasar TerminologyToday, the termquasarhas come to be used almost universally for both radio-loud QSRsand radio-quiet QSOs. As a result, it is common to encounter the descriptionsradio-loudquasarsandradio-quiet quasars. However, it is also sometimes the case that QSO is usedas an abbreviation forquasar. The terminology can be confusing in the literature, so it isimportant for you to understand the context in which the term is being used. In this text,we will generally usequasarto represent both classes of objects, making the distinctionbetween radio-loud and radio-quiet when necessary.5Ultraluminous Infrared GalaxiesNearly all quasars have spectra similar to those of broad-line radio galaxies and Seyfert 1s,with bright power-law continua and broad emission lines (both allowed lines and narrowerforbidden lines). Seyfert 2 spectra, with their narrow emission lines (both permitted andforbidden), appear to have no counterparts among the quasars. However, some astronomersargue that a subset of the galaxies that were cataloged by the IRAS satellite as being ultra-luminous at infrared wavelengths, known asultraluminous infrared galaxies(ULIRGs),shouldbeconsideredquasarsoftype2ratherthanstarburstgalaxies.Itissuggestedthattheinfraredlightresultsfromdustthatabsorbsandreradiatesthelightfromthequasarnucleus.The High Cosmological Redshifts of QuasarsTheSloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS)hascataloged46,420quasars.Thebrightesten-try in the catalog in theiband (centered on a wavelength of 748.1 nm) is the objectSDSS 17100.62+641209.0 at a redshift ofz=2.7356, havingMi=‚àí30.242.

For this reason, it is customary to quote the redshift,z, rather than anactual distance determination. You should keep in mind, however, that the fractional changein wavelength for a cosmological redshift is the same as the fractional change in the size ofthe universe,R, since the time when the light was emitted.6That is,z=Œªobs‚àíŒªemittedŒªemitted=Robs‚àíRemittedRemitted,which givesRobsRemitted=1+z.(3)Thus a redshift ofz=3 means that the universe is now four times larger than when thelight was emitted.Evidence for Quasar Evolutionheregionsthatarecosmologicallyclosetousmakeup‚Äútoday‚Äôsuniverse.‚ÄùInobservingtheseregions,astronomerscanstudygalaxiesastheyappearhereandnowinthepresentepoch.Whenlookingdeeperintotheuniverse,however,weseeancientphotonsthathavebeentravelingforalongtimefromasourcethatmayhavechangedsigniÔ¨Åcantlysincethelightbeganitsjourney.Thisessentiallymeansthatlookingfartherintospaceimpliespeeringfartherintothepast.Thustelescopesserveastimemachines,providingawindowtotheearlyuniverse.Bright quasars were certainly more common at earlier epochs than they are now, asevidenced by observations at large and smallz, respectively. Several factors could contributeto the greater space density of luminous quasars in the past. Both the total number of quasarsand their luminosities may have been different then, and it is obviously a difÔ¨Åcult task todisentangle these inÔ¨Çuences. A further complication is introduced by the expansion of theuniverse. The universe is larger today than it was at a redshiftzby a factor of 1+z,s ot h espace density of quasars would be greater in the past even if their numbers and luminositieshave remained constant. To avoid unnecessary confusion caused by the expansion of theuniverse, astronomers have deÔ¨Åned acomoving space densitythat mathematically removesthe effect of the expanding universe. The number of objects per Mpc3at a redshiftzis dividedby(1+z)3, scaling the space density down to the value it would have today (atz=0).The comoving space density of a constant number of nonevolving objects does not changeas the universe expands, and so a change in this density implies that the number of objectsis varying or that the objects are evolving (or both).Statistical studies indicate that there are more than 1000 times as many quasars perMpc3(comoving space density) brighter thanMB=‚àí25.9a tz=2 than there are today(z=0). However, there is strong evidence that the total number of quasars hasnotchangedsigniÔ¨Åcantly from the present (z=0) back to roughlyz=2.

Note that forz<2, the curves would overlap if they were shifted horizontallyalong theMg-axis. This indicates that forz<2, the populations of quasars with differentredshifts differ only in their luminosities, not in their comoving space densities. If this is so,then the scarcity of bright quasars today is an evolutionary effect, caused by a decrease intheir luminosities with time. This luminosity evolution of quasars is shown in Fig. 16.7Apparently, a picture in which a constant number of quasars grows dimmer as the universeexpands is consistent with the observations forz<2.The situation becomes more complicated betweenz=2 andz=3. Astronomers canstudy the birth and evolution of quasars out toz‚àº6. Statistical surveys at both optical andX-ray wavelengths show that the comoving space density of AGNs peaks at a redshift ofapproximatelyz‚âà2.5 and then drops off forz>3; see Fig. 17.

dispersion of its spheroid increases, so does the mass of the central supermassive blackhole.There is evidence, including interactions in observed quasars, suggesting that an individ-ual quasar ‚Äúevent‚Äù lasts only for a galactic dynamical timescale (the dynamical timescale,essentially the characteristic free-fall or orbital time).Figure18showsthequasarPKS2349‚àí014andacompaniongalaxyaboutthesizeoftheLMC(thesmallbrightspotjustabovethequasar).Thethincurvedwispsthatalmostsurroundthequasarareprobablytheresultofatidalinteractionbetweenthequasarandthecompaniongalaxy.ThecompanionissoclosethatitwillprobablymergewithPKS 2349‚àí014inthenearfuture.Aportionofthediffusenebulositycenteredonthequasarmay(ormaynot)representahostgalaxyinwhichitresides.In 2003, James S. Dunlop, Ross J. McLure, and their colleagues reported on an extensivestudy of the morphology of the host galaxies of 33 radio-loud quasars, radio-quiet quasars,and radio galaxies in the redshift band 0.1<z<0.25. The study was conducted by usingthe Hubble Space Telescope in combination with VLAradio imaging. The research team wasable to conclude that all of the galaxies in their sample associated with radio-loud quasarsor radio galaxies are massive ellipticals. Of the 13 radio-quiet quasars in the sample, 9 arehosted by massive ellipticals while the remaining 4 are in disk/bulge systems. Furthermore,of the 4 disk/bulge systems, the luminosities of 2 of them are dominated by their bulgecomponents, implying that 11 of the 13 radio-quiet quasars (or‚àº85%) are associatedwith galaxies that are predominantly spheroidal. In addition, the 2 disk-dominated galaxiesare the sites of the lowest-luminosity AGNs in the sample by far, and they may be moreappropriately considered Seyfert 2 galaxies. From the systems investigated in this study, itappears that all of the true quasars and radio galaxies in the sample are hosted by massiveellipticals that are nearly indistinguishable from lower-zquiescent galaxies typically foundnear the centers of rich clusters.

The study also revealed that all of the radio-loud quasars contained central supermassiveblack holes of at least 109M‚äôand that the radio-quiet quasars contained black holes withmasses in excess of 5√ó108M‚äô. It appears from this work that radio-loud systems aremuch less abundant than radio-quiet systems (10% vs. 90%) simply because the radio-loudsystems require more massive central black holes to power the strong radio energy emission.However, although the investigation did Ô¨Ånd a broad correlation between increasing blackhole mass and increasing radio luminosity, the most luminous radio sources cannot beattributed to black hole mass alone. Rather, there is speculation that black hole rotation alsomay be required to power the strongest radio sources.In a second, statistical study of 12,698 quasars with redshifts in the range 0.1<z<2.1found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalog, McLure and Dunlop considered theevolution of black hole masses with increasing redshift. They found that black hole massessufÔ¨Åcient to power quasars were in place byz‚àº2. They further determined that all ofthe central black holes had masses in the range 107M‚äô<Mbh<3√ó109M‚äô, where theupper limit corresponds to the most massive black holes yet found in the local universe(speciÔ¨Åcally, in M87 and Cygnus A).The SDSS quasar study was also able to point out that quasar bolometric luminositiesincrease steadily with redshift from roughly 0.15LEdatz‚àº0.2 to 0.5LEdatz‚àº2.0, whereLEdistheEddingtonluminosity.It is also evident from the data that theEddingtonluminositylimitremainsvalidatthehigh-zend of the study.Timescales of AGN VariabilityThe energy produced by many of the AGNs discussed above (excluding NLRGs andSeyfert 2s) can vary on short timescales. The luminosity of the broad emission lines andcontinuum of some Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars can change by a factor of 2 within afew months, weeks, or even days, although there is little or no corresponding variation inthe narrow lines. The variation in broad emission lines typically lags behind the continuumvariation over similar timescales. There are also variations of a few percent in the visibleand X-ray output of Seyfert 1s and quasars on timescales as short as a few minutes, withX-ray Ô¨Çuctuations typically the most rapid. At the other end of the scale, there may bechanges of a longer duration. For example, Fig. 19 shows that around the year 1937, thequasar 3C 279 brightened by a factor of 250 at visible wavelengths during an outburst thatlasted for several years.Polarization of the EmissionQuasars typically show low degrees of polarization. At visible wavelengths, the degreeof linear polarization is usually less than 3% for both radio-quiet and radio-loud objects,although it may reach up to 35% polarization for a few objects. The radio emission fromhigh-polarization quasars comes mostly from a compact core; such quasars are calledcore-dominant radio sources(and alsocompact sources). These quasars are less polarized atradio wavelengths than thelobe-dominant sources, which may reach up to 60% linearpolarization. The degree of linear polarization of AGN radio jets is typically 40% but mayexceed50%withinasmallregion.(ynchrotronradiationishighlylinearlypolarized.Thelowerpolarizationofthecore-dominantsourcesisprobablyActive Galaxies

Fanaroff andRiley deÔ¨Åned Class I objects as those for which the ratio of the distance between the brightestspots of radio emission on either side of the center (excluding the central source) to the fullextent of the radio source is less than 0.5; Class II objects have a ratio greater than 0.5. Anexample of an FR I galaxy is NGC 1265, shown in Fig. 9, and Cyg A is a classic exampleof an FR II galaxy (Fig. 6). Quasars are also FR II objects.From the classiÔ¨Åcation scheme, it becomes apparent that FR I sources have diminishingradio luminosity with increasing distance from the center of the jets, while FR IIs tend tobe most radio-bright at the ends of the lobes. It is also common that FR I galaxies havetwo recognizable radio jets, while FR II galaxies often exhibit only a single identiÔ¨Åable jet(the counterjet is either very weak or undetectable). Furthermore, FR I galaxies may havecurved jets, while FR II jets tend to be straight.Also intriguing, and the reason why this morphological classiÔ¨Åcation scheme is referredto as a luminosity classiÔ¨Åcation, is that there is also a rather clear demarcation between FR Iand FR II classes in terms of the speciÔ¨Åc luminosity. Sources having a speciÔ¨Åc luminosityat 1.4 GHz of less than 1025W Hz‚àí1are identiÔ¨Åed as FR Is, and those with greater speciÔ¨Åcluminosities are inevitably classiÔ¨Åed as FR IIs.BlazarsThe properties of rapid variability and a high degree of linear polarization at visible wave-lengths deÔ¨Åne the class of AGNs known asblazars. The most well-known object in thisclass is BL Lacertae, found in the northern constellation of Lacerta (the Lizard). BL LacActive Galaxies

In a week‚Äôs time BL Lac would double its lu-minosity, and it would change by a factor of 15 as the months passed. But although BL Lachas a stellar appearance, its spectrum shows only a featureless continuum with very weakemission and absorption lines. Careful observations reveal that the bright, starlike nucleusof BL Lac is surrounded by a fuzzy halo that has a spectrum similar to that of an ellipticalgalaxy.BL Lac objectsare a subclass of blazars that are characterized by their rapid time-variability. Remarkably, their luminosities may change by up to 30% in just 24 hours andby a factor of 100 over a longer time period. BL Lacs are also distinguished by theirstrongly polarized power-law continua (30‚Äì40% linear polarization) that are nearly devoidof emission lines. However, observations of a few faint spectral lines have revealed highredshifts, so that, like quasars, BL Lacs are at cosmological distances. Of those BL Lacs thathave been resolved, about 90% appear to reside in elliptical galaxies. Joining the BL Lacobjects in the blazar classiÔ¨Åcation are theoptically violently variable quasars(OVVs).They are similar to the BL Lacs except that they are typically much more luminous, andtheir spectra may display broad emission lines.LINERsA Ô¨Ånal class of objects worth mentioning consists of the so-calledLow Ionization NuclearEmission-line Regions(LINERs). These galaxies have very low luminosities in their nuclei,Active Galaxies

but with fairly strong emission lines of low-ionization species, such as the forbidden linesof [O I] and [N II]. The spectra of LINERs seem similar to the low-luminosity end ofthe Seyfert 2 class, and LINER signatures are detected in many (perhaps a majority of)spiral galaxies in high-sensitivity studies. These low-ionization lines are also detectable instarburst galaxies and in H II regions, and so it is unclear whether LINERs truly representa low-luminosity limit of the AGN phenomena.A Summary of AGN ClassiÔ¨ÅcationsThis section has introduced a large number of objects with some commonalities and someapparent differences.

2A UNIFIED MODEL OF ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEIThe last section presented a bewildering array of observations of AGNs. Although therewere many similarities, such as a bright compact nucleus, a wide continuum, and timevariability, there were also many differences, including the presence or absence of broademission lines, and the strength of radio and X-ray emission. The question is: Are the typesof AGNs fundamentally different or fundamentally the same?It now seems likely that active galactic nuclei are all powered by the same generalengine, accretion onto central supermassive black holes.Accordingly,theobservationaldifferencesareduetothedifferentorientationsoftheobjectsasviewedfromEarthandtothedifferentratesofaccretionandmassesofthecentralblackholes.Thepresenceofradiolobesisthensomethinginadditionto,andconsistentwith,thebasicmodel.Although there is not yet general agreement on some of the speciÔ¨Åc details of a uniÔ¨Åedmodel of AGNs, the model does serve to provide a framework for organizing the observa-tions of AGNs and their interpretations. Any model should be self-consistent, meaning thatits constitutive elements are all in harmony. Also, as with all viable theories and modelsin science, a successful AGN model should have the power to predict the results of newobservational tests, in addition to explaining all of the observations made previously. Suc-cessful predictions have been made on the basis of the idea of uniÔ¨Åcation, and it appearsthat the basic features of a uniÔ¨Åed model of AGNs are in hand. The purpose of this sectionis to demonstrate how the features of such a model may be deduced and to describe the bestidea of what an AGN probably looks like.Toward a UniÔ¨Åed Model of AGNsFirst, we will examine two pieces of evidence suggesting that the pursuit of a uniÔ¨Åed modelis indeed justiÔ¨Åed. Figure 21 showsLHŒ±, the luminosity in the HŒ±emission line, andLFC, the luminosity of the featureless continuum at a wavelength near 480 nm, plotted fora variety of AGNs (excluding blazars). If the hydrogen emission lines are produced via thephotoionization of hydrogen atoms by the continuum radiation and the atoms‚Äô subsequentrecombination, then the two luminosities should be proportional, and a straight line with aslope of 1 should be found on a log‚Äìlog graph.The slope of the dashed line is 1.05, conÔ¨ÅrmingthatLHŒ±‚àùLFC. This result implies a common origin for the hydrogen emission lines, bothbroad and narrow, that are observed in AGNs for Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, broad- andnarrow-line radio galaxies, and radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars.Another piece of evidence for a uniÔ¨Åed model comes from an observation reported byRobertAntonucci and Joseph Miller in 1985. When they observed NGC 1068 (a Seyfert 2) inpolarized light, they found a Seyfert 1 spectrum with broad emission lines. This and similarcases discovered since then imply that within these Seyfert 2s are Seyfert 1 nuclei thatare hidden from the direct view of Earth by some optically thick material. The diminishedSeyfert 1 spectrum (normally overwhelmed by the direct Seyfert 2 spectrum) comes fromlight that reaches us indirectly by reÔ¨Çection from the interstellar medium outside the nucleus.This reÔ¨Çection would also contribute to the observed linear polarization, when the electricÔ¨Åeld vector is perpendicular to the radio axis. The orientation of the AGN relative to theline of sight from Earth will be an important factor in the uniÔ¨Åed model to be described.Active Galaxies

The brightening is thus smeared out over a time intervalœÑDeltaœÜt=R/c.In this way, the rapidity of a luminosity change can be used to set an upper limit on thesize of the object involved. The high recessional speeds of quasars mean that relativity alsoplays a role.

dropping matter straight down onto a black hole is veryinefÔ¨Åcientbecause there is nosurface for the mass to strike. Instead, according to an observer at a great distance, a freelyfalling mass would slow to a halt and then disappear as it approached the Schwarzschildradius,RS. On the other hand, as matter spirals in toward a black hole through an accretiondisk, a substantial fraction of the rest energy can be released as viscosity converts kineticenergy into heat and radiation.For a nonrotating black hole, the smallest stable circular orbit for a massive particle (andtherefore the inner edge of an accretion disk) is atr=3RS. At this location, theoreticalcalculations show that the gravitational binding energy is 5.72% of the particle‚Äôs rest-mass energy, so mass spiraling down through an accretion disk would release this muchenergy. The situation is even more favorable for a rotating black hole because the eventhorizon is located at a smallerr. For the most rapidly rotating black hole possible, both theevent horizon and the smallest stable prograde orbit are atr=0.5RS(the smallest stableretrograde orbit is at 4.5RS). The gravitational binding energy in this case of maximalrotation is calculated to be 42.3% of a particle‚Äôs rest mass.Theaccretion luminositygenerated by a mass accretion rate,ÀôM, through the disk maybe written asLdisk=Œ∑ÀôMc2,(6)whereŒ∑istheefÔ¨Åciencyoftheprocess,0.0572‚â§Œ∑‚â§0.423.(Forcomparison,heefÔ¨Åcienciesforaccretionontoa0.85M‚äôwhitedwarfanda1.4M‚äôneutronstarareŒ∑=1.9√ó10‚àí4and 0.21, respectively.)The accretion of matter through a disk around a rapidly rotating black hole is an ex-tremely efÔ¨Åcient way of producing large amounts of energy.

It is thought that the big blue bump observed in the spectra of quasars is the thermalsignature of an underlying accretion disk. However, although accretion is believed to providethe power for AGNs, the theoretical spectrum of an accretion diskcannotaccountforthewidecontinuumthatisactuallyobserved.Structure of the Accretion DiskA detailed model of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole is difÔ¨Åcult toderive because the high luminosities involved must have a signiÔ¨Åcant effect on the disk‚Äôsstructure. Theoretical calculations indicate that the structure of the accretion disk dependsonfEd(Eq. 8). Several possible structures have been identiÔ¨Åed. IffEd<0.01, then thedensity of the disk is too small for efÔ¨Åcient cooling. The energy generated by the disk‚Äôsviscosity (internal friction) cannot be radiated away efÔ¨Åciently, and the disk puffs up intoanion torusthat is supported by the pressure of the hot ions. Part or all of the disk wouldthen resemble a doughnut around the central black hole. Values of 0.01<fEd<0.1o rs oimplyageometricallythindiskforclosebinarysystemsbydeÔ¨Ånition,atanyradialdistancerinathindisk,theverticalheighth‚â™r). As thevalueofLdiskbecomessuper-Eddington(fEd>1),theradiationpressurethatisgeneratedbalancestheforceofgravityandthephotonsarecapableofsupportingthematterinaninÔ¨Çatedradiation torus.One scenario involves a composite disk that has three regions, as shown in Fig. 23.Within about 1000RSof the center, radiation pressure exceeds the gas pressure, resultingin a thick, hot disk. This is the probable origin of the big blue bump in the continuousspectrum. Exterior to this, reaching out to some 105RS(‚âÉ1p cf o rM=108M‚äô), is a thindisk that is supported by gas pressure. This part of the disk Ô¨Çares outward, becoming thickerwith increasing radius. The concave surface of the outer disk means that it can be irradiatedby the central source or the thick, hot portion of the inner disk, resulting in a wind Ô¨Çowing

outward from the disk. Finally, beyond about 105RS, the thick disk breaks up into numeroussmall clouds.Unfortunately, some problems with this picture remain. For example, the values offEdquoted above for Seyferts appear to be incompatible with models of thick disks.The Implications of AGN SpectraFor the blazars, at least, there is widespread agreement that the continuous spectrum, withits power-law form and signiÔ¨Åcant polarization, is produced by synchrotron radiation.orpulsars,synchrotronradiationisproducedwhenrelativisticchargedparticles,suchaselectrons,spiralaroundmagneticÔ¨Åeldlines.(Forobjectsotherthanblazars,thesituationismorecomplicated.hebigbluebumpobservedinthe continua of other types of AGNs is believed to be thermal radiation. In addition, dustemission plays an important role in the infrared.)With a wide range of photon energies available for ionizing atoms, synchrotron radiationcan account for the variety of ionization states observed in the emission line spectra ofAGNs.For example, a number of ionization states have been seen for forbidden lines, including[O I] and [Fe X]. Furthermore, synchrotron radiation can be up to 70% linearly polarized,in agreement with the high degrees of polarization observed for some AGNs.Producing a Relativistic OutÔ¨Çow of Charged ParticlesIt might seem surprising to Ô¨Ånd a magnetic Ô¨Åeld involved in this situation. Although itis theoretically possible for an isolated black hole to have a magnetic Ô¨Åeld, it is unlikelyto occur naturally. This is because although the three attributes of a black hole (its mass,angular momentum, and electric charge) can be combined to produce a magnetic Ô¨Åeld, blackholes should be essentially electrically neutral, since any net charge acquired by a blackhole would be rapidly canceled as it attracted charge of the opposite sign. However, theionized disk material is highly conducting, so there can be a magnetic Ô¨Åeld that is generatedby the accretion disk as the disk orbits the black hole.It may be thatthevaryingmagneticÔ¨ÅeldnearthesurfaceofthediskinducesalargeelectricÔ¨Åeldthatiscapableofacceleratingchargedparticlesawayfromthedisk.Astheparticlesmoveoutward, they are accelerated to relativistic speeds while they spiral around the magneticÔ¨Åeld lines that rotate with the disk. Because the Ô¨Åeld lines are anchored to the conductingdisk, the particle energy ultimately comes at the expense of the accretion energy.There is another source of energy that taps the rotational energy of the black hole itself,Ô¨Årst described by Roger Blandford and Roman Znajek. Detailed calculations show thatthe rotating black hole can be thought of as a spinning conductor in a magnetic Ô¨Åeld; seeFig. 24. Just as the motion of a conducting wire through a magnetic Ô¨Åeld will producean electromotive force (emf) between its ends, the rotation of a black hole in a magneticÔ¨Åeld will produce a potential difference between its poles and its equator. The effectiveresistance of the rotating black hole between its poles and equator is about 30œÑOmegaœÜ. In thispicture, the black hole acts like an immense battery connected to a 30-œÑOmegaœÜresistor. Power isextracted from the black hole‚Äôs rotational energy, just as if a current of charged particleswere Ô¨Çowing through the resistor in response to the voltage difference.

The energyis in the form of electromagnetic radiation and a Ô¨Çow of relativistic pairs of electrons andpositrons. Up to 9.2% of the rest energy of a maximally rotating black hole may be extractedin this manner. This is another important source of energy, comparable to that obtained bydisk accretion.The two processes just described appear capable of producing a relativistic outÔ¨Çowof charged particles, although the mechanism is still uncertain. As the electrons spiralaround the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines, they emit the synchrotron radiation that contributes tothe continuous spectrum of AGNs. (You will recall from Section 1 that the observedpower-law synchrotron spectra of AGNs imply that the distribution of electron energies isdescribed by a power law. Just how this distribution comes about is as yet unknown, butpower-law synchrotron spectra are also observed for supernova remnants such as the CrabNebula.)The Generation of X-RaysAGNs can be very bright in X-rays,8and several mechanisms are usually invoked to ex-plain the excess over that produced directly by synchrotron radiation. The high-frequencyend of the accretion disk spectrum may be sufÔ¨Åcient to account for the soft (low-energy)X-rays. Lower-energy photons from other sources may also be scattered to much higher8X-rays from AGNs are probably responsible for theX-ray background, a uniform glow of X-ray photons that per-vades the sky. Discovered in 1962, the X-ray background extends into the gamma-ray region of the electromagneticspectrum.Active Galaxies

A careful examination of theselines reveals much about the conditions under which they were formed.All of the broad linesarise from permitted atomic transitions, but none of them involve the forbidden transitionsseen in some narrow lines. The broad HŒ±and HŒ≤lines vary on timescales of a monthor less, while the narrow lines seem to vary little, if at all. This evidence, along with thediscovery that Seyfert 2 galaxies may harbor Seyfert 1 nuclei that are hidden from directview by some obscuring material, indicates that the broad and narrow lines in the spectraof AGNs originate in different regions under different conditions.The Broad-Line RegionThe broad emission lines observed in the spectrum of manyAGNs are formed in abroad-lineregionthat is relatively close to the center.Astudy of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 revealedthat when the intensity of the continuum radiation varied, most of the broad emission linesresponded very quickly, within a month or less and perhaps as quickly as one week. Lightcan travel a distance of nearly 1015m in 30 days, so this provides a rough estimate ofthe radius of the broad-line regions for Seyferts and BLRGs. The variation of the lines inquasars takes place more slowly, so their broad-line regions may be larger by a factor offour or so. A study of the broad Fe II emission lines that are usually present indicates thatthe temperature in the broad-line region is‚àº104K. Other lines indicate that the numberdensity of electrons probably lies between 1015m‚àí3and 1016m‚àí3. Forbidden lines will notbe seen with large number densities such as these because of the frequent collisions betweenthe atoms. Atoms and ions with electrons in the long-lived metastable states that give riseto forbidden lines are deexcited by collisions before downward radiative transitions canoccur. As a result, the forbidden lines are much weaker than the permitted lines.There is widespread agreement that the broad-line region must be clumpy, containingpartially ionized clouds of gas, rather than being homogenous. The optically thick cloudsthat actually produce the emission lines Ô¨Åll only about 1% of the available volume andprobably have a Ô¨Çattened distribution. These regions of high density may be surrounded bya rareÔ¨Åed, high-temperature medium that prevents the clouds from dispersing.According to the uniÔ¨Åed model, the various types of observed AGN phenomena (seeTable 1) derive from different viewing angles of the central engine and surroundingenvironment. The uniÔ¨Åed model postulates that a large, optically thick torus of gas and dustsurrounds the clouds of the broad-line region. This is presumably what conceals the broad-line region and the central source from direct view when observing a Seyfert 2 galaxy; seeFig. 25. In this case, the continuum and emission lines must reach the observer indirectlyActive Galaxies

Of course it is important to be consistent in terms of which ionized species areused in making the measurement (in other words, which emission line is used in the study)because highly ionized species tend to have the shortest lag times, suggesting that the levelof ionization in the broad-line region is dependent on distance from the central source.Bycomparisonwithotherblackhole‚Äìspheroidrelations,suchasthemass‚Äìvelocitydispersionrelationforasampleofresolvedgalacticcenters,thescalingfactorinEq.(12)isfoundtohavethevaluef‚âà5.5.Thereverberationmappingmethodrequires long-term observations to determine the lag times, and high spectral resolution,but it does not require spatially resolving the central region of the host galaxy.

Theclouds that are far enough above or below the plane of the obscuring torus can be illumi-nated and photoionized by the continuum radiation from the center.

Observations of the nearest Seyfert 2 galaxies show narrow-line regions with diametersbetween roughly 100 and 1000 pc. If we letrNLR=200 pc,ne=1010m‚àí3, andŒ±qm=3.1√ó10‚àí19m3s‚àí1,the Ô¨Ålling factor of the narrow-line region is approximatelyœµ‚âà3N4œÄŒ±qm1n2er3NLR=2.2√ó10‚àí2.Thus clouds occupy roughly 2% of the volume of the narrow-line region.The proÔ¨Åles of the narrow emission lines seen in Seyfert 2s often have extended bluewings, indicating that the clouds are moving toward us relative to the galactic nucleus. Thisis usually interpreted as a radial Ô¨Çow of the clouds away from the center. The light fromthe clouds moving away from us on the far side of the AGN is presumably diminished byextinction.An outward Ô¨Çow of clouds in the region that produces narrow emission lines could bedriven by a combination of radiation pressure and a wind coming from the accretion disk,as mentioned previously, or the outÔ¨Çow could be associated with the material in radio jets.Figure 27 shows an image obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope of the narrow-line

region for the Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4151. Distinct emission clouds are clearly evidentin this high-resolution image. It is also evident that the optical emission falls within twoconical distributions extending to the northeast and the southwest of the center of the galaxy.When a radio map is overlaid on the image, the radio emission also falls along the sameaxis as the biconical optical emission.Similar observations have been made of Mrk 3, a Seyfert 2 galaxy. In this case there isadditional evidence that the narrow-line region is composed of expanding shells around theradio jets. It has been suggested that the material forming the radio jets is expanding at near0.1cfrom the center of the galaxy. As the jets move through the interstellar material, the gasis ionized at a temperature of‚àº107K. The overheated gas expands outward away fromthe jets, energizing the gas near the surface of the expanding shell, which then produces thenarrow-line emission region.A further consequence of the expanding jet model of producing the narrow-line regionis that the region may be relatively short-lived, at least in the case of the relatively weakSeyfert systems. Since the radio jets of Seyfert galaxies are typically only a few kiloparsecsin length, this implies that ages of roughly 104to 105years can be deduced based on theexpansion velocity of the jets. If that is the case, Seyfert phenomena may be relativelytransient events, perhaps caused by the temporary feeding of the galaxy‚Äôs supermassiveblack hole.A Summary of the UniÔ¨Åed Model of AGNsThe preceding details comprise what must be considered as a rough sketch of a uniÔ¨Åedmodel of an AGN. Its central engine is an accretion disk orbiting a rotating, supermassiveblack hole. The AGN is powered by the conversion of gravitational potential energy intosynchrotron radiation, although the rotational kinetic energy of the black hole may also serveas an important energy source. The structure of the accretion disk depends on the ratio ofthe accretion luminosity to the Eddington limit. To supply the observed luminosities, themost energetic AGNs must accrete between about 1 and 10 M‚äôyr‚àí1. The perspective ofthe observer, together with the mass accretion rate and mass of the black hole, largelydetermines whether the AGN is called a Seyfert 1, a Seyfert 2, a BLRG, a NLRG, or aradio-loud or radio-quiet quasar.Although many of the details of the uniÔ¨Åed model have not yet been fully conÔ¨Årmed,the uniÔ¨Åed model does appear to provide an important framework for describing many ofthe general characteristics of active galaxies. For example, Fig. 28 shows an amazingHST image of NGC 4261, an elliptical radio galaxy in the Virgo cluster that is classiÔ¨Åedoptically as a LINER. The core of this radio-loud object shows a bright nucleus surroundedby a large, obscuring torus that is perpendicular to the radio jets. The central object isprobably a 107M‚äôblack hole, although the HST image does not have the resolution toconÔ¨Årm this. The torus has a radius of about 70 pc (2√ó1018m), and the jets reach out some15 kpc from the nucleus.1010The Schwarzschild radius of a 107M‚äôblack hole is 2.95√ó1010m, smaller than the torus by nearly eight ordersof magnitude. The black hole would be less than a nanometer wide on the scale of Fig. 28.Active Galaxies

(Courtesy of NASA.)3RADIO LOBES AND JETSThere is a basic division of active galaxies into objects that are radio-loud and those thatare radio-quiet. Radio-loud sources usually consist of a radio core, one or two detectablejets, and two dominant radio lobes. The radio-quiet sources are less luminous at radiowavelengths by a factor of 103to 104, consisting of a weak radio core and perhaps a feeblejet. The increased level of activity in radio-loud AGNs is not conÔ¨Åned to radio wavelengths,however; they also tend to be about three times brighter in X-rays than their radio-quietcousins.The Generation of JetsThe radio lobes are produced by jets of charged particles ejected from the central nucleusof the AGN at relativistic speeds; recall Fig. 8. These particles are accelerated awayfrom the nucleus in two opposite directions, powered by the energy of accretion and/or bythe extraction of rotational kinetic energy from the black hole via the Blandford‚ÄìZnajekmechanism. The jet must be electrically neutral overall, but it is not clear whether the ejectedmaterial consists of electrons and ions or an electron‚Äìpositron plasma. The latter, being lessmassive, would be more easily accelerated. The disk‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld is coupled (‚Äúfrozenin‚Äù) to this Ô¨Çow of charged particles. The resulting magnetic torques may remove angularmomentum from the disk, which would allow the accreting material to move inward throughthe disk.The incredible narrowness and straightness of some jets means that a collimating pro-cess must be at work very near the central engine powering the jet.

The loops represent contours of constant disk density.disk around the black hole could provide natural collimation by funneling the outÔ¨Çowingparticles, as shown in Fig. 29. Because the accreting material retains some angular mo-mentum as it spirals inward through the disk, it will tend to pile up at the smallest orbit thatis compatible with its angular momentum. Inside this ‚Äúcentrifugal barrier‚Äù there may be arelatively empty cavity that can act as a nozzle, directing the accreting gases outward alongthe walls of the cavity. However, producing highly relativistic jets, as frequently observed,appear to be difÔ¨Åcult to accomplish with this nozzle mechanism.Alternatively, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects could play an important role in ac-celerating and collimating the relativistic Ô¨Çows. Unfortunately, details of MHD mechanismshave not yet been fully developed either. Whatever the speciÔ¨Åc details of the collimation ofjets, their straightness is likely to be linked to the rotating supermassive black holes at thehearts of AGNs.The Formation of Radio LobesAs a jet of material travels outward, its energy primarily resides in the kinetic energy ofthe particles. However, the jet encounters resistance as it penetrates the interstellar mediumwithin the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium beyond. As a result, the material at thehead of the jet is slowed, and a shock front forms there. The accumulation and decelerationof particles at the shock front cause the directed energy of the jet to become disordered as theparticles ‚Äúsplash back‚Äù to form a large lobe in which the energy may be shared equally bythe kinetic and magnetic energy. The problem of calculating the motion of a jet through theintergalactic medium is so complicated that extensive numerical simulations are required tomodel the process. Figure 30 shows a series of computer simulations of jets with variousinitial energies working their way through the intergalactic medium.The motion of the charged particles and the magnetic Ô¨Åelds within the lobes of radio-loud objects contain an enormous amount of energy.

In diffuse radio lobes, the value may be more than an orderof magnitude smaller, while the Ô¨Åeld strength in the radio core is probably around 100 nT.Accelerating the Charged Particles in the JetsThe observations of jets are made possible by inefÔ¨Åciencies in the transport of particles andenergy out to the radio lobes. The spectra of the radio lobes and jets follow a power law,with a typical spectral index ofŒ±‚âÉ0.65. The presence of power-law spectra and a highdegree of linear polarization strongly suggest that the energy emitted by the lobes and jetscomes from synchrotron radiation.The loss of energy by synchrotron radiation is unavoidable, and in fact the relativisticelectrons in jets will radiate away their energy after just 10,000 years or so. This impliesthat there is not nearly enough time for particles to travel out to the larger radio lobes; forexample, for the large radio galaxy 3C 236, the journey would take several million years,even at the speed of light. This long travel time and the long lifetime of radio lobes implythat there must be some mechanism for accelerating particles in the jets and radio lobes. Asone possibility, shock waves may accelerate charged particles by magnetically squeezingthem, reÔ¨Çecting them back and forth inside the shock. Radiation pressure may also play arole, but it alone is not enough to generate the necessary acceleration.Superluminal VelocitiesAlthough the standard model of jets and radio lobes requires a steady supply of chargedparticles moving at relativistic speeds, evidence for such high velocities is difÔ¨Åcult to obtain.The absence of spectral lines in a power-law spectrum means that the relativistic velocity ofthe jet material cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from indirect evidence. Themost compelling argument for relativistic speeds involves radio observations of materialActive GalaxiesT

This effectis observed within about 100 pc of the AGN‚Äôs center and probably continues farther out.Example 3.3.Figure 31 is a radio view of the core of the quasar 3C 273 thatshows a blob of radio emission moving away from the nucleus with an angular velocityof¬µ=0.0008‚Ä≤‚Ä≤yr‚àí1. Assuming that the radio knot is traveling in the plane of the sky,perpendicular to the line of sight, and using a distance ofd=440h‚àí1Mpc for 3C 273, theapparenttransverse velocity of the blob away from the nucleus is,vapp=d¬µ=1.67√ó109h‚àí1ms‚àí1=5.57h‚àí1c.Ifh=[h]WMAP, we Ô¨Ånd thatvapp=7.85c.

AGNs exhibit two radio lobes. It is expected that the central engines of AGNs producetwo oppositely directed jets; however, relativistic beaming seems to explain why the jetsappear to be only one-sided.The Roles of Galactic CompanionsThe galactic companions of AGNs may play an important role in supplying them with thefuel. Most Seyferts (at least 90%) are spiral galaxies, and many have close neighbors withwhom they may be interacting. Gravitational perturbations produce the distorted appear-ancefrequentlyseeninthoseSeyfertscloseenoughtobestudied,asevidencedbytheappearanceofbarsand/orouterrings.heseinteractionscouldproducegravitationaltorquesonthegasinaSeyfertgalaxy,drasticallyreducingitsangularmomentum and sending the gas plunging into the galactic center. The result would be thedelivery of a fresh supply of fuel to the Seyfert nucleus to be accreted by the black hole.The concentration of gas could also result in a burst of star formation around the nucleus.Furthermore, if a merger with a galactic companion occurs, the subsequent disruption couldproduce an elliptical galaxy with an active nucleus, resulting in a young radio galaxy.Mergers are certainly important for quasars as well. Some low-redshift quasars showevidence of past interactions (see Fig. 18), and mergers were undoubtedly more commonin the early universe than they are today. Since galaxies are believed to have contained moregas when they were young, mergers may have resulted in the infall of large amounts of gasthat could have contributed to the growth of a central supermassive black hole as the gassimultaneously fueled its activity. In addition, mergers probably resulted in the coalescing ofsupermassive black holes, producing even larger central engines. As the masses of the blackholes grew, so did the number of quasars and their energy output, until the fuel poweringthe engines was largely consumed.AGN EvolutionWhat happens when a quasar runs out of fuel? In broad terms, the diminishing fuel supply ofan energetic object could lead to its transformation into a less luminous form. For example,Cen A has huge radio lobes (see Fig. 11) but is a weak radio source. It was probablymuch more luminous in the past but is now fading away. On the other hand, a lesserluminosity could be explained by a less massive black hole rather than a smaller accretionrate. Our Milky Way does not have a 108M‚äôblack hole at its center, although there is amoremodestoneof3.7√ó106M‚äô.If,ashasbeenconjectured,everylargegalaxycomparabletotheMilkyWayhasasupermassiveblackholeofatleast106M‚äô,then low-level galactic activity may be a common occurrence.One large impediment to understanding the evolution of active galaxies is our current lackof knowledge about their lifetimes. Some researchers Ô¨Ånd that aroundz=2, the number ofluminous AGNs decreases toward the present-day epoch with a characteristic decay time ofœÑ‚âÉ2h‚àí1Gyr. However, this is only anupper limitto the lifetime of an AGN. A single AGNmay remain active this long, or the individual lifetimes may be much shorter, say between107and 108years, the typical timescale needed to radiate away the energy stored in a radiolobe. In this latter case,œÑwould describe the statistical changes in a population of activegalaxies, rather than the behavior of a single individual. A galaxy may then experience justActive Galaxies

Clouds of gas, galaxies, and dark matter can allaffect the light from a quasar during its journey to Earth. By decoding the clues suppliedby observations of quasars, astronomers can learn a great deal about the perturbing objectsalong the line of sight.Gravitational Lensing and Multiple Images of QuasarsIn1919,thesameyearthatEddingtonmeasuredthebendingofstarlightasitpassedneartheSunandveriÔ¨ÅedEinstein‚Äôsgeneraltheoryofrelativity,SirOliverLodge(1851‚Äì1940),anEnglishphysicist,putforththepossibilityofusingagravitationallenstofocusstarlight(recallthediscussionofgravitationallensing).Duringthe1920s,astronomersbegantoconsiderhowlightpassingthroughthecurvedspacetimesurrounding a massive object could produce multiple images of the source. Then, in 1937,Fritz Zwicky (1898‚Äì1974) proposed that gravitational lensing by a galaxy would be muchmore likely than gravitational lensing by individual stars. By the 1970s the search was onfor a multiply imaged quasar, and in 1979 the quasar Q0957+561 was discovered to appeartwice in the sky.

As a result, the two images are formed on opposite sides of the gravitational lens, soMwill be positive.Example 4.1.For the quasar Q0957+561 shown in Fig. 33,Œ∏1=5.35‚Ä≤‚Ä≤=2.59√ó10‚àí5rad, andŒ∏2=‚àí0.8‚Ä≤‚Ä≤=‚àí3.88√ó10‚àí6rad. (Which angle assumes the minus sign isarbitrary.) From the quasar‚Äôs redshift ofzS=1.41 and the gravitational lens redshift ofzL=0.36, the Hubble law gives the corresponding distances ofdS=2120h‚àí1Mpc anddL=890h‚àí1Mpc. Then Eq.

In this case,Œ≤=0 in Fig. 35, and so Eq. ( 21) can be solvedimmediately for the angular radius of the Einstein ring,Œ∏E=/radicalBigg4GMc2/parenleftbiggdS‚àídLdSdL/parenrightbiggrad.(24)Of course, for a point source, the chance of an exact alignment with the lensing mass isessentially zero. For an extended source, the requirements for an Einstein ring are thatŒ≤<Œ∏Eand that the line of sight through the lensing mass must pierce the extended source.Figure 36 shows a calculation of a partial ring‚Äîthe image of a slightly off-center source.The Ô¨Årst Einstein ring to be discovered, MG1131+0456, was found at radio wavelengthsby the VLA. Figure 37 shows the radio appearance of the ring, which is thought to bethe image of a radio galaxy lensed by an elliptical galaxy.The value ofŒ∏Ecan be calculated for any gravitational lens, regardless of the alignmentof the lens and the source. Although the image may not be a ring,Œ∏Edoes provide a usefulparameter for describing the properties of any gravitational lens. IfŒ≤<Œ∏E, as shown inFig. 35, there will be two images formed by the point mass. IfŒ≤‚â´Œ∏E, the position andbrightness of the source are only slightly altered, but a secondary image appears close tothe lensing mass that is reduced in angular size by a factor of(Œ∏E/Œ≤)4.A point mass is clearly a crude representation of an actual galaxy. A better model of thelensing galaxy is provided by an isothermal sphere around a central core, similar to theActive Galaxies

Note that image A has brightened by 0.5 mag in the 3-year intervalbetween the photos.Luminous Arcs in Galaxy ClustersAnother striking example of gravitational lensing is the formation of arcs by light passingthrough a cluster of galaxies. One such arc in the cluster Abell 370 is shown in Fig. 39.Up to 60 additional ‚Äúarclets‚Äù and several distorted distant background galaxies have alsobeen observed in that cluster. The source of the large arc must be a resolved object such as agalaxy rather than the starlike nucleus of a quasar. According to one model of Abell 370, thelensing mass (visible galaxies and dark matter) needed to produce the images in Abell 370is at most about 5√ó1014M‚äô. Taken with the combined luminosity of a few√ó1011L‚äôforthe lensing galaxies, this implies a mass-to-light ratio of at least 1000 M‚äô/L‚äô, indicatingthe presence of large amounts of dark matter.Abell 370 is an unusual cluster in that it is sufÔ¨Åciently centrally condensed to produce sucharcs. The dark matter in most clusters is probably more widely distributed, producing weaklensing effects just strong enough to distort the appearance of distant galaxies seen beyondthe cluster. Figure 40 shows a spectacular example of multiple arclets that are lensedimages of background galaxies produced by the cluster Abell 2218. Such weak lensing canalso cause an apparent bunching of quasars, so statistical studies of the clustering of objectsin the very early universe must take this effect into account.Time Variability of Multiple ImagesAn interesting effect occurs when the source for a pair of images increases its luminosity.Because the light from the source takes different paths on its way to the observer, thereActive Galaxies

Nonperiodiccelestial events usually catch astronomers by surprise, but this time delay puts astronomersin the unique situation of knowing in advance how a lensed quasar will behave.It turns out that the time delay is also inversely proportional to the Hubble constant.This offers a way of determining the value ofH0that is independent of any other distanceActive Galaxies

measurement. At the cosmological distances of quasars, their recessional velocities shouldcompletely dominate their peculiar velocities through space. One study using Q0957+561concluded thatH0=69¬±21 km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1, assuming that the lensing galaxy containsa substantial amount of dark matter. The result is in excellent agreement with the WMAPvalue ofH0=71+4‚àí3km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1.The Lyman-Alpha ForestThe spectra of high-redshift quasars always display a large number of narrow absorptionlines superimposed on the quasar‚Äôs continuous spectrum (these lines are in addition to anybroad absorption lines that are associated with the quasar itself). These narrow lines areformed when the light from a quasar passes through material (an interstellar cloud, a galactichalo) that happens to lie along the line of sight. If the absorbing material is far from Earth, itsrecessional motion will cause these absorption lines to be strongly redshifted. Furthermore,if the light passes through more than one cloud or galactic halo during its trip to Earth,different sets of absorption lines will be seen. Each set of lines corresponds to the redshiftof a particular cloud or halo.There are two classes of narrow absorption lines in quasar spectra:‚Ä¢ TheLyman-Œ±forestis a dense thicket of hydrogen absorption lines. These linesare believed to be formed in intergalactic clouds and display a variety of redshifts.Absorption by primordial ionized helium (He II) has also been detected.‚Ä¢ Lines are also formed byionized metals, primarily carbon (C IV) and magnesium(Mg II), together with silicon, iron, aluminum, nitrogen, and oxygen. The mix of ele-ments is similar to that found in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way, indicatingthat the material has been processed through stars and enriched in heavy elements.These lines are thought to be formed in the extended halos or disks of galaxies foundalong the line of sight to the quasar.Most of these lines are normally found at ultraviolet wavelengths, when the absorbingmaterial is moving at a small fraction of the speed of light relative to Earth (i.e., has asmall redshift). They are rarely seen from the ground because Earth‚Äôs atmosphere absorbsmost ultraviolet wavelengths. However, if the absorbing material is receding fast enough,the Doppler effect can shift ultraviolet lines to visible wavelengths, where the atmosphereis transparent. For this reason, these absorption lines are seen from the ground only in thespectra of highly redshifted quasars.Example 4.2.The rest wavelength of the ultraviolet Lyman-Œ±line of hydrogen isŒªLyŒ±=121.6 nm.Todeterminetheredshiftrequiredtobringthislineintothevisibleregionoftheelectromagneticspectrum,wecanusethedeÔ¨Ånitionofz,z=Œªobs‚àíŒªrestŒªrest.continuedActive Galaxies

UsingŒªrest=ŒªLyŒ±andŒªobs=400 nm for the blue end of the visible spectrum, we requirea redshift ofz>400 nm‚àí121.6 nm121.6 nm‚âÉ2.3,just to bring the LyŒ±line to the edge of the visible spectrum. Actually, some near-ultravioletlight can penetrate Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, so the LyŒ±line can be observed whenz>1.7 forthe absorbing material.Typically, the spectrum of a high-redshift quasar contains a strong Lyman-Œ±emissionline produced by the quasar itself, and perhaps some 50 LyŒ±absorption lines at shorterwavelengths (smaller redshifts); see Fig. 41. Each one of these lines is from a differentintergalacticcloudofhydrogen(andpresumablyhelium)encounteredbythequasar‚ÄôscontinuumradiationonitsjourneytoEarth.heLyŒ±lineproÔ¨Ålecanbeusedtocalculatethecolumndensityoftheneutralhydrogenatomsinthecloudthatproduces each line. A typical result is 1018m‚àí2. In other words, a hollow tube having across-sectional area of 1 m2that crossed completely through the cloud would contain 1018neutral hydrogen atoms. Such a cloud would be extremely transparent to the ultravioletradiation that is normally present throughout space. As a result, this ultraviolet backgroundcan penetrate the cloud and keep it almost completely ionized. Calculations indicate thatonly one hydrogen atom in 105remains neutral in the cloud and is capable of absorbing anultraviolet photon.

We deduce the size of the intergalactic clouds by comparing the LyŒ±forest in the spectraof pairs of lensed quasars. Many of the absorption lines are seen in both spectra, but someare not. This indicates that the clouds are, on average, about the size of the lensing galaxy.From the total calculated column density of hydrogen (ionized as well as neutral), the massof a typical cloud probably lies between 107and 108M‚äô. At the temperature estimatedfor a typical cloud by some astronomers (approximately 3√ó104K), its self-gravity wouldbe too weak to keep it from dispersing. It may be held together by the pressure of a lessdense (but hotter) external intergalactic medium or by the presence of dark matter withinthe cloud.Ionized Metal Absorption Lines in QuasarsThe narrow absorption lines produced by ionized metals in quasar spectra have a differentorigin. They can be divided into two groups as observed from Earth‚Äôs surface, correspondingto two different redshift ranges. Below roughlyz=1.5, the Mg II lines dominate, accom-panied by Si II, C II, Fe II, and Al II, because they fall within the wavelength window thatcan be seen from the ground (the Mg II lines are probably produced in the halos of normalgalaxies or in regions of star formation.). The C IV lines, together with Si IV , N V , and O IV ,are common between aboutz=1.2 andz=3.5, however.The distribution of redshifts of these lines is in general agreement with the expecteddistribution of galaxies at that earlier time when the universe was smaller by a factorof 1+z, assuming that the galactic halos are typically some 30‚Äì50 kpc across. In fact,some Mg II systems withz<1 have been clearly identiÔ¨Åed with foreground galaxies seenin direct images. The C IV lines probably come from clouds in young galaxies that arestrongly ionized by young, hot OB stars. These narrow metal lines indicate lower-than-solar abundances of heavy elements, consistent with their origin in young galaxies that maystill be in the process of forming.The Density Distribution of Intergalactic CloudsThe comoving space density of intergalactic clouds appears to have been greater in thepast than it is today, so the number of clouds has been decreasing as the universe ages. Astatistical analysis of the clouds‚Äô redshifts reveals little evidence that the clouds tend to begrouped in clusters. Instead, they appear to be distributed randomly throughout space. Inparticular, there do not appear to be large voids in the distribution of these intergalacticclouds(thesigniÔ¨Åcanceofthisisnotyetclear).ThedistributionoftheHeIIissimilarlyuncertain.SUGGESTED READINGGeneralCourvoisier, Thierry J.-L., and Robson, E.

Cosmology1Newtonian Cosmology2The Cosmic Microwave Background3Relativistic Cosmology4Observational CosmologyNEWTONIAN COSMOLOGYOn December 27, 1831, a ship sailed out of Plymouth, England, on a voyage around theworld that would last nearly Ô¨Åve years. Only 90 feet long, theBeaglewas crowded with74 people, one of whom was Charles Darwin. During stops in South America, the Gala-pagos Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia, he exercised his formidable powers ofobservation. In 1859, after two decades of careful study and reÔ¨Çection, Darwin publishedOn the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of FavoredRaces in the Struggle for Life. For the Ô¨Årst time, people began to comprehend their ownorigins.Other discoveries followed during the next one hundred years, with careful observationsand brilliant deductions uncovering more about our beginnings. The elucidation of DNAand plate tectonics revealed the mechanisms by which we and our planet evolved. Theideas of stellar nucleosynthesis explained the manufacture of the chemical elements bystars, implying the origin of our corporeal bodies and the ground on which we walk. Eventhe universe itself was found to be expanding. Then, in 1964, two researchers at BellLaboratories measured the afterglow of the Big Bang, conÔ¨Årming the explosive origin ofeverything in existence. It is difÔ¨Åcult to imagine a more breathtaking leap from ignoranceto self-knowledge than that which occurred during this century of discovery.Cosmology, taken as a whole, is the study of the origin and evolution of the universe.In this chapter, cosmology will be considered from several different perspectives. To helpdevelop our intuition, this section will discuss the expansion of the universe from thepoint of view of Newtonian mechanics, without the complications (or insights) provided bygeneral relativity or the modern ideas of particle physics. The discovery and implicationsof the cosmic microwave background radiation are described in Section 2, followed, inSection 3, by an introduction to the geometry of the universe as explained by generalrelativity. Section 4 describes how some of the key parameters of cosmology may bemeasured observationally.1

Olbers‚Äôs ParadoxNewton believed in an inÔ¨Ånite static universe Ô¨Ålled with a uniform scattering of stars. If thedistribution of matter did not extend forever, he realized, then it would collapse inward dueto its own self-gravity. However, Newton‚Äôs contemporary, Edmund Halley, worried about asky Ô¨Ålled with an inÔ¨Ånite number of stars. Why then, asked Halley, is the sky dark at night?This question was put in its strongest form by a German physician, Heinrich Olbers(1758‚Äì1840). Olbers argued in 1823 that if we live in an inÔ¨Ånite, transparent universe Ô¨Ålledwith stars, then in any direction one looks in the night sky, one‚Äôs line of sight will fall onthe surface of a star. (Similarly, if standing in an inÔ¨Ånite forest, in every direction you lookyou will see a tree.) This conclusion is valid regardless of whether the stars are uniformlydistributed, as Newton believed, or grouped in galaxies. Olbers‚Äôs argument was so strongthat its disagreement with the obvious fact that the night sky is indeed dark became knownasOlbers‚Äôs paradox.Olbers believed that the answer to this paradox was that space is not transparent. The ideasof thermodynamics were still being developed at that time, and Olbers could not appreciatethat his explanation was incorrect. The Ô¨Çaw was that any obscuring matter hiding the starsbeyond would be heated up by the starlight until it glowed as brightly as a stellar surface.Surprisingly, the Ô¨Årst essentially correct answer came from American poet and author EdgarAllan Poe (1809‚Äì1849). Poe proposed that because light has a Ô¨Ånite speed and the universeis not inÔ¨Ånitely old, the light from the most distant sources has not yet arrived. This solutionwas independently put on a Ô¨Årm scientiÔ¨Åc foundation by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin,1824‚Äì1907). In more modern terms, the solution to Olbers‚Äôs paradox is that our universe issimply too young for it to be Ô¨Ålled with light.Developing Our Intuition: A Newtonian ApproachYou will soon discover that this chapter contains more mathematics than the precedingmaterial. The reward for the necessary effort is aquantitativedescription of how the uni-verse unfolded that is much more satisfying than qualitative storytelling. Although generalrelativity is required for a complete understanding of the structure and evolution of theuniverse, it is useful to develop some intuition by Ô¨Årst considering the expansion of theuniverse from a Newtonian point of view.The Cosmological PrincipleIt has beenarguedthatHubble‚Äôslawisanaturaloutcomeofanexpandinguniversethatisbothisotropicandhomogeneous, appearing the same in alldirectionsandatalllocations.Thiscrucialassumptionofanisotropicandhomogeneousuniverseiscalledthecosmological principle.ToshowthattheexpansionoftheuniverseIt is sometimes argued that the cosmological redshift caused by the expansion of the universe is responsible forthe darkness of the night sky because it shifts starlight out of the visible spectrum. In fact, this effect is much toosmall to contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly to a dark night sky.In some derivations, many of the intermediate steps have been omitted. Filling in these mathematical gaps hasbeen relegated to several of the end-of-chapter problems.12

Unlike the actual universe, this model universe is both perfectly isotropicand homogeneous at all scales. The pressureless dust represents all of the matter in theuniverse after being homogenized and uniformly dispersed. It should not be confused withthe physical dust grains found throughout the interstellar medium. There are no photons orneutrinos in this single-component model of the universe.As the universe expands, the dust is carried radially outward from the origin.

Then the mechanical energyEof the shell isK(t)+U(t)=E.As the shell expands, the gravitational pull from the mass inside causes the kinetic energy,K, to decrease while the gravitational potential energy,U, increases. However, by con-servation of energy, the total energy,E, of the shell does not change as the shell movesoutward. For future convenience, the total energy of the shell is written in terms of twoconstants,kandœñ, such thatE=‚àí12mkc2œñ2. The constantkhas units of(length)‚àí2;its meaning will be explored in Section 3. The other constant,œñ(‚Äúvarpi‚Äù), labels thisparticular mass shell and may be thought of as thepresentradius of the shell, sor(t0)=œñ.The statement of the conservation of the mass shell‚Äôs energy is then12mv2(t)‚àíGMrmr(t)=‚àí12mkc2œñ2.(1)Intheleft-handsideofEq.(1),Mris the mass interior to the shell,Mr=43œÄr3(t)œÅ(t).Although the radius of the shell and the density of the dust are continually changing, thecombinationr3(t)œÅ(t)does not vary because the mass interior to a speciÔ¨Åc shell remainsconstant as the universe expands.

The constantkdetermines the ultimate fate of the universe:‚Ä¢ Ifk>0, the total energy of the shell is negative, and the universe isbounded,o rclosed. In this case, the expansion will someday halt and reverse itself.‚Ä¢ Ifk<0, the total energy of the shell is positive, and the universe isunbounded,o ropen. In this case, the expansion will continue forever.‚Ä¢ Ifk=0, the total energy of the shell is zero, and the universe isÔ¨Çat, neither opennor closed. In this case, the expansion will continue to slow down, coming to a haltonly ast‚Üí‚àûand the universe is inÔ¨Ånitely dispersed.The Newtonian cosmology of this section always takes place in a Ô¨Çat spacetime.The termsclosed,open, andÔ¨Çatabove should be understoodas describing thedynamicsof the universal expansion. In Section 3, these terms will bereinterpreted to describe the geometry of spacetime.The cosmological principle requires that the expansion proceed in the same way for allshells; for example, the time required for every shell to double its distance from the originis assumed to be the same. This means that the radius of a particular shell (identiÔ¨Åed byœñ)at any time can be written asr(t)=R(t)œñ.(3)In this expression,r(t)is called thecoordinate distance. Becauseœñlabels a shell andfollows it as it expands,œñis referred to as acomoving coordinate; see Fig. 3.R(t)is adimensionlessscale factor(thesameforallshells)thatdescribestheexpansion;R(t0)=1corresponds tor(t0)=œñ.ThescalefactorRisequaltoRemitted/Robs.Thus

That is, sinceR(t0)=1,R3(t)œÅ(t)=R3(t0)œÅ(t0)=œÅ0,(5)whereœÅ0is the density of the dust-Ô¨Ålled universe at the present time. Using Eq. ( 4), thiscan also be written asœÅ(z)=œÅ0(1+z)3,(6)which gives the average density of the universe as observed at redshiftz. You are cautionedthat Eqs. ( 5) and ( 6) are valid only for a universe consisting of pressureless dust. Themore general counterpart of Eq. ( 5) will be derived at the end of this section.The Evolution of the Pressureless ‚ÄùDust‚Äù UniverseThe evolution of our Newtonian universe, which can be described by the time behavior ofthe scale factorR(t), will be investigated in the next few pages.Abrief Ô¨Çurry of mathematicswill produce the needed tools. The Ô¨Årst step is to write the Hubble parameter,H(t), in termsof the scale factor. The Hubble law isv(t)=H(t)r(t)=H(t)R(t)œñ.(7)Becausev(t)is the time derivative ofr(t), Eq.

The left-hand sides of Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) apply toall shellsand involve the functions oftimeH(t),œÅ(t), andR(t), while the right-hand sides are constant (the same for all positionsand times).

First, consider the case of a Ô¨Çat universe (k=0), corresponding to eachshell expanding at exactly its escape velocity. The value of the density that will result in avalue ofk=0 is known as thecritical density,œÅc(t). From Eq. ( 9),œÅc(t)=3H2(t)8œÄG.(12)Toevaluatethisatthepresenttime,itisusefultoknowthattheHubbleconstantinconventionalunitsisH0=100hkm s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1=3.24√ó10‚àí18hs‚àí1(13)which, using the WMAP value of[h]WMAP=0.71,is[H0]WMAP=71 km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1=2.30√ó10‚àí18s‚àí1.(14)The present value of the critical density,œÅc,0, is thenœÅc,0=3H208œÄG=1.88√ó10‚àí26h2kg m‚àí3,(15)with a WMAP value ofœÅc,0=9.47√ó10‚àí27kg m‚àí3.(16)This is equivalent to about six hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.

or 1 hydrogen atom per 4 m3of space. By ‚Äúbaryonic matter,‚Äù we mean matter made ofbaryons(e.g., protons and neutrons); hence the ‚Äúb‚Äù subscript designating baryonic matter inEq. ( 17). As will be explained in Section 2, this value is consistent with that obtainedfrom comparing the theoretical and observed abundances of light elements, such as helium-3 and lithium-7, that were formed in the early universe. The density of nonbaryonic darkmatter, which is of unknown composition, is not included in the value ofœÅb,0. Nonbaryonicdark matter is revealed only by its gravitational inÔ¨Çuence on baryonic matter. Presumably itinteracts very weakly (if at all) with photons and charged particles via the electromagneticforce, so it does not absorb, emit, or scatter appreciable amounts of light. Our model universeof pressureless dust includes both types of matter, baryonic and nonbaryonic, luminous anddark.The ratio of a measured density to the critical density is an important parameter incosmology. Accordingly, it is useful to deÔ¨Åne thedensity parameter,œáOmegaœÜ(t)‚â°œÅ(t)œÅc(t)=8œÄGœÅ(t)3H2(t),(18)which has a present value ofœáOmegaœÜ0=œÅ0œÅc,0=8œÄG œÅ03H20.(19)Table 1 shows the mass-to-light ratios of a variety of astronomical systems and thedensity parameters derived for them. With the exception of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, thesevalues were obtained by studying gravitational effects and thus include both baryonic anddark matter. There is a signiÔ¨Åcant trend that more extensive systems have larger mass-to-light ratios and density parameters, but, as shown in Fig. 4, for the largest systems thedensity parameters seem to reach a ‚Äúceiling‚Äù at a maximum value ofœáOmegaœÜ0‚âÉ0.3. This isconsistent with the WMAP result for the value of the average density of all types of matter,baryonic and dark:[œáOmegaœÜm,0]WMAP=(0.135+0.008‚àí0.009)h‚àí2=0.27¬±0.04 (forh=0.71).(20)This corresponds to a mass density ofœÅm,0=2.56√ó10‚àí27kg m‚àí3(forh=0.71)(21)The ‚Äúm‚Äù subscript, which stands for ‚Äúmass,‚Äù anticipates models of the universe with morethan one component. This subscript will be suppressed for the present one-componentmodel.Actually, anything made of known particles whose density obeys Eq. ( 5) counts as baryonic matter. Thisexcludes photons and neutrinos because, as we shall see in Section 2, a gas of either of these particles does notobey Eq. ( 5). Such a gas exerts a pressure and therefore is inconsistent with our model universe of pressurelessdust.4

(22)Thus, according to the WMAP results, baryonic matter accounts for only about 16% of thematter in the universe; the other 84% is some sort of nonbaryonic dark matter.The general characteristics of the expansion of our model universe composed of pres-sureless dust can now be determined.

‚Ä¢ IfœáOmegaœÜ0<1, thenk<0 and the universe is open.‚Ä¢ IfœáOmegaœÜ0=1, thenk=0 and the universe is Ô¨Çat.Remember that we are now dealing with a simple model of a one-component universe ofpressureless dust. Later we will study more realistic multicomponent models, which willshow that a measurement of the mass density parameter alone is not enough for us to drawany conclusions about the ultimate fate of our physical universe.Equating Eqs. ( 24) and ( 5), and using ( 4), we Ô¨ÅndH2(1‚àíœáOmegaœÜ)=H20(1‚àíœáOmegaœÜ0)(1+z)2.(26)Thus we have two equations, Eqs. ( 23) and ( 26), with the two unknownsœáOmegaœÜandH.These may be easily solved to Ô¨ÅndH=H0(1+z) (1+œáOmegaœÜ0z)1/2(27)andœáOmegaœÜ=/parenleftbigg1+z1+œáOmegaœÜ0z/parenrightbiggœáOmegaœÜ0=1+œáOmegaœÜ0‚àí11+œáOmegaœÜ0z.(28)Equation ( 27) implies that at very early times, asR‚Üí0 andz‚Üí‚àû, the Hubble pa-rameterH‚Üí‚àû. Equation ( 28) shows that the sign ofœáOmegaœÜ‚àí1 does not change, and inparticular that ifœáOmegaœÜ=1 at any time, thenœáOmegaœÜ=1 at all times. The character of the universedoes not change as the universe evolves; it is either always closed, always open, or alwaysÔ¨Çat. Equation ( 28) also shows that at very early times, asz‚Üí‚àû, the density parameterœáOmegaœÜ‚Üí1 regardless of today‚Äôs value ofœáOmegaœÜ0.Therefore, the early universe was essentially Ô¨Çat;see Fig. 5. The assumption of a Ô¨Çat early universe will greatly simplify the descriptionof the Ô¨Årst few minutes of the universe.Example1.1.Later we will Ô¨Ånd that when the universe was about 3 minutes old,protons and neutrons combined to form helium nuclei. This occurred at a redshift ofz=3.68√ó108. Using the WMAP value of[œáOmegaœÜm,0]WMAP=0.27 forœáOmegaœÜ0, we Ô¨Ånd that at the timeof helium formation, the value ofœáOmegaœÜwasœáOmegaœÜ=1+œáOmegaœÜ0‚àí11+œáOmegaœÜ0z=1+0.27‚àí11+(0.27)(3.68√ó108)=0.99999999265.(29)At even earlier times the value ofœáOmegaœÜcontains a much longer string of nines. During the latetwentieth century, it appeared absurd to theoreticians that a mechanism would exist to Ô¨Åne-tuneœáOmegaœÜto a value so very close to unity without having an exactly Ô¨Çat universe withœáOmegaœÜ=1.And yet, observational measurements of the value of the density parameter continued tohover aroundœáOmegaœÜ0‚âÉ0.3. The solution to this puzzle will be described in Section 3, wherewe will Ô¨Ånd that the theoreticians and the observers werebothcorrect.Cosmology

Extending Our Simple Model to Include PressureLet‚Äôs take stock of the basic equations we have derived so far and generalize them a bit,anticipating some features of the equations of general relativity we will encounter in Sec-tion 3. We start with Eq. ( 10),/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg1RdRdt/parenrightbigg2‚àí83œÄG œÅ/bracketrightBiggR2=‚àíkc2.With a nod toward Einstein‚ÄôsErest=mc2, we broaden the meaning of the densityœÅtoinclude matter in all of its forms. For nonrelativistic particles,œÅis the usual mass density.For relativistic particles, such as photons and neutrinos,œÅis theequivalent mass density‚Äîthat is, the energy density divided byc2.Equation ( 5),R3œÅ=œÅ0, describes the conservation of mass within the expandingshell. Again acknowledging the equivalence of mass and energy, this equation is also astatement of the conservation of energy for a pressureless dust universe.A thermodynamic argument supplies the generalization of Eq. ( 5) for models of theuniverse that incorporate pressure-producing components. Imagine a universe Ô¨Ålled with aÔ¨Çuid (dust, photons, etc.) of uniform densityœÅ, pressureP, and temperatureT, and choosean arbitrary point for the origin. Letrbe the radius of a comoving spherical surface, centeredon the origin. We will employ the Ô¨Årst law of thermodynamics, which applies the law ofconservation of internal energy,U, to the Ô¨Çuid within the expanding sphere:dU=dQ‚àídW.(49)First note that the entire universe has the same temperature, so there can be no heat Ô¨Çow:dQ=0. That is, the expansion of the universe is adiabatic. Any change in internal energymust be produced by work done by the Ô¨Çuid. Writing the result as a time derivative,dUdt=‚àídWdt=‚àíPdVdt.and substitutingV=43œÄr3, we obtaindUdt=‚àí43œÄPd(r3)dt.If we deÔ¨Åne the internal energy per unit volumeuasu=U43œÄr3,then we Ô¨Åndd(r3u)dt=‚àíPd(r3)dt.We need not worry about photons leaving the sphere, because the cosmological principle assures us that the samenumber of equivalent photons will enter the sphere.6

Writinguin terms of the equivalent mass densityœÅ,œÅ=uc2,givesd(r3œÅ)dt=‚àíPc2d(r3)dt.Finally, usingr=Rœñ(Eq. 3), we obtain theÔ¨Çuid equation,d(R3œÅ)dt=‚àíPc2d(R3)dt.(50)For a universe of pressureless dust,P=0s oR3œÅ=constant, in agreement with Eq. ( 5).An equation describing the acceleration of the universal expansion can be obtained bymultiplying Eq. ( 10) byRand then taking a time derivative. Using Eq. ( 50) to replaced(œÅR3)/dtand using Eq. ( 10) to eliminate the‚àíkc2, we arrive at theaccelerationequationd2Rdt2=‚àí43œÄG/parenleftbiggœÅ+3Pc2/parenrightbiggR.(51)Note that the effect of the pressurePis to slow down the expansion (assumingP>0).If this seems counterintuitive, recall that because the pressure is the same everywherein the universe, both inside and outside the shell, there is no pressure gradient to exerta net force on the expanding sphere. The answer lies in the motion of the particles thatcreates the Ô¨Çuid‚Äôs pressure. The equivalent mass of the particles‚Äô kinetic energy creates agravitational attraction that slows down the expansion just as their actual mass does. In fact,the assumption thatP=0 is valid for much of the history of the universe. For instance,youwillÔ¨ÅndthatœÅ‚â´P/c2in today‚Äôs universe.Equation ( 51) is an illustration ofBirkhoff‚Äôs theorem. In 1923 the American mathe-matician G. D. Birkhoff (1884‚Äì1944) proved quite generally that for a spherically symmetricdistribution of matter, Einstein‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld equations have a unique solution. As a corollary, theacceleration of an expanding shell in our Ô¨Çuid universe is determined solely by the Ô¨Çuidlying within the shell. Equation ( 51) shows that the acceleration does not depend onany factors other thanœÅ,P, andR. Because Birkhoff‚Äôs theorem holds even when generalrelativity is included, it is quite important in the study of cosmology.Equations ( 10), ( 50), and ( 51) have three unknowns:R,œÅ, andP. However,the equations are not independent; any two may be used to derive the third. To solve thesetwo equations forR,œÅ, andP, we need a third relation, anequation of state, that links thevariables. Such an equation of state can be written generally asP=wu=wœÅc2,(52)Cosmology

wherewis a constant. In words, the pressure is proportional to the energy density of theÔ¨Çuid. For example, for mass in the form of pressureless dust,wm=0, and for blackbodyradiation,withtheequationofstatePrad=urad/3,wehavewrad=1/3.Insertingthegeneralequationofstate,Eq.(52),intotheÔ¨Çuidequation,Eq.(50),quicklyproduces the relationR3(1+w)œÅ=constant=œÅ0,(53)whereœÅ0is the present value of the mass density (or equivalent mass density). For pres-sureless dust (wm=0), we recover Eq. ( 5),R3œÅm=œÅm,0.The Deceleration ParameterFinally, we introduce a useful dimensionless quantity that describes the acceleration of theuniversal expansion: thedeceleration parameter,q(t), which is deÔ¨Åned asq(t)‚â°‚àíR(t)[d2R(t)/dt2][dR(t)/dt]2.(54)Both the name and the minus sign (to ensure thatq>0 for a deceleration) betray the cer-tainty of twentieth-century astronomers that the expansion of the universe must be slowingdown with time.For a pressureless dust universe,q(t)=12œáOmegaœÜ(t),(55)and so at the present time,q0=12œáOmegaœÜ0.(56)Thus, for a pressureless dust universe,q0=0.5 for a Ô¨Çat universe, whileq0>0.5 andq0<0.5 correspond to a closed and an open universe, respectively.THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUNDIn 1946 George Gamow was pondering the cosmic abundances of the elements. Realizingthat the newborn, dense universe must have been hot enough for a burst of nuclear reactionsto occur, he proposed that a sequence of reactions in the very early universe could explainthemeasuredcosmicabundancecurve.Gamow,togetherwithRalphAlpher,publishedthisideatwoyearslater.Stilllater,however,detailedcalculationsbyIn Section 3 this sense of certainty will be toppled.Gamow, a Russian √©migr√©, was famous for his Puckish sense of humor. When this paper Ô¨Årst appeared, Gamowadded Hans Bethe as a co-author (without Bethe‚Äôs knowledge). Gamow thought it would be appropriate that apaper on cosmic beginnings be authored by Alpher (Œ±), Bethe (Œ≤), and Gamow (Œ≥), a play on the Ô¨Årst three lettersof the Greek alphabet.7

Alpher and Robert Herman (1914‚Äì1997) showed that Gamow‚Äôs idea was Ô¨Çawed becausethere were roadblocks to assembling succeedingly heavier nuclei simply by adding protonsor neutrons. There are no stable nuclei with Ô¨Åve or eight nucleons, leaving42He as theheaviest element that can be formed as Gamow proposed. (A small amount of an isotope oflithium,73Li, is also formed in the early universe by the nuclear fusion of42He with31H andthe fusion of42He with32He. The latter produces74Be, which radioactively decays to73Li.)At that time, there was also a large problem with the idea of a hot, dense universe cominginto existence approximately one Hubble time ago. Edwin Hubble‚Äôs original value of hisconstantwasH0=500 km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1,whichcorrespondstotH=1/H0=109yrfortheageoftheuniverse.ThisisonlyafractionofEarth‚Äôsage,whichin1928hadbeenradioactivelydatedasseveralbillionyears.Bythelate1940sfurthermeasurementsindicated that 1/H0=1.8√ó109yr, which was still embarrassingly short. It was certainlyhard to understand how Earth could be older than the universe.The Steady-State Model of the UniverseIn 1946 at Cambridge University, Hermann Bondi (1919‚Äì2005), Thomas Gold (1920‚Äì2004), and Fred Hoyle (1915‚Äì2001) attempted to Ô¨Ånd an alternative to Gamow‚Äôs unpalat-able Big Bang universe. In papers published in 1948 and 1949, they proposed their modelof asteady-state universe. It extended the cosmological principle to include time, statingthat, in addition to the universe being isotropic and homogeneous, it also appears the sameat all times. A steady-state universe has no beginning and no end. It is inÔ¨Ånitely old, and asit expands, a continuous creation of matter is required to maintain the average density ofthe universe at its present level. This changes the interpretation of the Hubble time; ratherthan the characteristic age of the universe,tHbecomes a characteristic time for the creationof matter. If the universe roughly doubles in size in timetH, then its volume becomes eighttimes greater, and so the rate of matter creation required to maintain the universe as it istoday is approximately 8œÅ0/tH=8H0œÅ0. Just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter ofspace would need to be created every ten billion years, a rate far too small to be mea-sured experimentally. In the original steady-state models, the ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù ‚Äúwhere,‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äùof the spontaneous appearance of new matter (in violation of the law of conservation ofmass‚Äìenergy) were questions left unanswered. The appeal of the steady-state universe wasits resolution of the timescale problem.10Just as Gamow and his collaborators tried to explain the cosmic abundance curvebyusingthenuclearreactionsthatwouldaccompanyaBigBang,Hoylesoughtanexplanationinthenuclearreactionsthattookplaceinsidestars.HejoinedforceswithtwoEnglishcolleagues,GeoffreyandMargaretBurbidge(atheoreticalphysicistandanastronomer, respectively), and William Fowler (1911‚Äì1995), an American physicist. InIronically, it was Fred Hoyle who came up with the termBig Bang. He used it derisively in a 1950 BBC radiobroadcast when he said, ‚ÄúThis big bang idea seemed to me to be unsatisfactory even before examination showedthat it leads to serious difÔ¨Åculties. For when we look at our own Galaxy there is not the smallest sign that such anexplosion ever occurred.‚Äù10The solution to the short Hubble time appeared in 1952, when Walter Baade discovered that there were twotypes of Cepheid variable stars. This revised the period‚Äìluminosity relation that forms the foundation of the cosmicdistance scale.9

1957 they published their seminal paper, referred to as B2FH, that laid out the theory ofstellar nucleosynthesis.The B2FH analysis was a success, and its results were compatible with both the BigBang and steady-state cosmologies. During the 1950s both theories had their supportersand detractors. However, in addition to the unanswered questions about the continuous cre-ation of matter, the steady-state theory had a serious problem explaining the large amountof helium observed in the universe. Astronomers had established that about one-quarter(0.274¬±0.016) of the baryonic mass of the universe is in the form of helium. Whencompared to the cosmic abundances of the heavier elements, it was clear that stellar nucle-osynthesis could not account for the amount of helium observed, especially considering thatcarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the results of exhaustively burning the star‚Äôs helium core.Gamow,Alpher,andHermanhadshownthattheBigBangcouldatleast explain the abundance of helium, but where was the proof that such a violent event hadever occurred? To invoke an event that was apparently beyond the reach of investigationseemed unscientiÔ¨Åc to many astronomers.The Cooling of the Universe after the Big BangA key idea of theŒ±‚ÄìŒ≤‚ÄìŒ≥paper was that the dense, early universe must have been very hot.In this hot, dense universe, the mean free path of photons would have been short enough tomaintain thermodynamic equilibrium. Although an expanding universe cannot be preciselyin equilibrium, this assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is extremely good.In 1948 Alpher and Herman published their description of how this blackbody radiationwould have cooled as the universe expanded, and they predicted that the universe shouldnow be Ô¨Ålled with blackbody radiation at a temperature of 5 K.The cooling of the blackbody radiation can be derived by considering its energy den-sityu=aT4.AccordingtotheÔ¨Çuidequation(Eq.53)withwrad=1/3forblackbodyradiationandR(t0)=1,R3(1+wrad)urad=R4urad=urad,0.(57)The energy density today,urad,0, is smaller than the earlier valueuradby a factor ofR4;afactor ofR3is due to the fact that the volume of the universe has increased since then, andthe other factor ofRcomes from the lesser energy of today‚Äôs longer-wavelength photons(Ephoton=hc/Œª), a result of the cosmological redshift. ThusR4aT4=aT40,and we Ô¨Ånd that the present blackbody temperature must be related to the temperature at anearlier time byRT=T0.(58)That is, the product of the scale factor and the blackbody temperature remains constant asthe universe expands. When the universe was half as large, it was twice as hot.UndertheseconditionstheradiationÔ¨Åeldhasablackbodyspectrum.Cosmology

An order-of-magnitude estimate of the present blackbody temperature of the universemay be calculated by considering the temperature and baryonic mass density that must haveprevailed in the early universe when helium was being formed. The fusion of hydrogen nu-clei requires roughly thatT‚âÉ109K andœÅb‚âÉ10‚àí2kg m‚àí3. If the temperature were anyhigher, the deuterium nuclei involved in the fusion chain would have undergone photodis-sociation due to the presence of energetic blackbody radiation, whereas a lower temperaturewould have made the Coulomb barrier between the nuclei too difÔ¨Åcult to overcome. Thequoted density is needed to produce the observed amounts of32He and other nuclei. FromEqs. ( 5) and ( 17), the value of the scale factor at the time of the helium formationwas roughlyR‚âÉ/parenleftbiggœÅb,0œÅb/parenrightbigg1/3=3.47√ó10‚àí9.At that time, the universe was only a few billionths of its present size. Combining thescale factor withT (R)=109K, the present temperature of the blackbody radiation can beestimated from Eq. ( 58) asT0=RT (R)‚âÉ3.47 K,similar to Alpher and Hermann‚Äôs original estimate of5Ki n1948. Wien‚Äôs law then givesthe peak wavelength of the blackbody spectrum asŒªmax=0.00290 m KT0‚âÉ8.36√ó10‚àí4m.The Discovery of the Cosmic Microwave BackgroundSixteen years after Alpher and Herman predicted that the universe had cooled to5Ka n dwas Ô¨Ålled with blackbody radiation, Robert Dicke (1916‚Äì1997) of Princeton University andhis postdoctoral student P. J. E. Peebles unknowingly followed in their footsteps. In 1964Peebles calculated that the blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang should havea temperature of about 10 K. Unlike Alpher and Herman, however, Dicke was interestedin searching for the relic radiation. He didn‚Äôt realize that this cosmic background radiationhad just been found by two radio astronomers working a few miles away at Bell Labora-tories in Holmdel, New Jersey.11Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were working with ahuge horn reÔ¨Çector antenna (shown in Fig. 8) that had been used to communicate withthe new Telstar satellite. Despite a year of effort, the two men had been unable to get ridof a persistent hiss in the signal. The hiss came continually from all directions in the skyand remained even after Penzias and Wilson had scrubbed their antenna clean, taped overseams and rivets, and removed two pigeons that had nested inside the horn.12They knewthat a 3 Kblackbody would produce their interference but were unaware of any possiblesource until Penzias learned of Peeble‚Äôs calculation of a 10-K background. Penzias called11Interestingly, it was in Holmdel that Karl Jansky built his Ô¨Årst radio telescope.12The pigeons were freed 60 miles away. Unfortunately, they proved to be homing pigeons and had to be removedagain.Cosmology

Dicke, Peebles, and their co-workers at Princeton immediatelywrote a note for theAstrophysical Journal Lettersdetailing the theory of the cosmic mi-crowave background that strongly supported the Big Bang cosmology, while Penzias andWilson wrote an accompanying letter, discreetly titled ‚ÄúA Measurement of Excess AntennaTemperature at 4080 Megacycles per Second,‚Äù that described their discovery.The discovery of the CMB was a death knell for steady-state cosmology. As furthermeasurements at other wavelengths conÔ¨Årmed that the shape of the CMB spectrum wasthat of a blackbody, the number of astronomers supporting the Big Bang theory swelledwhile those favoring a steady-state universe dwindled. In 1991 a striking measurement ofthe cosmic microwave background was obtained by the COBE satellite.The COBE measurement of the spectrum of the CMB is shown in Fig. 9. The datapoints (whose errors are smaller than the points themselves) fall almost perfectly on thetheoretical spectrum of a 2.725-K blackbody.

Courtesy of NASA/GSFC and theCOBE Science Working Group.)The Dipole Anisotropy of the CMBThe cosmic microwave background suffuses the entire universe. It does not emanate fromany object but, rather, originated in the Big Bang, when the entire universe was essentiallylocated at a single point (or event) of spacetime. For this reason, all observers at rest withrespect to the Hubble Ô¨Çow (no peculiar velocity) see the same spectrum for the CMB, withthe same intensity in all directions (the CMB is isotropic). In particular, two observers indifferent galaxies that are being carried apart by the Hubble Ô¨Çow see the same blackbodyspectrum.14However, there is a Doppler shift of the CMB caused by an observer‚Äôs peculiar velocitythrough space, relative to the Hubble Ô¨Çow. Using Wien‚Äôs law, a shift in wavelength can beexpressed as a change in the temperature of the blackbody radiation.

The second term on the right-hand side, called thedipoleanisotropyof the CMB, has been detected and measured; see Fig. 10. The temperaturevariation indicates that the peculiar velocity of the Sun relative to the Hubble Ô¨Çow is 370.6¬±0.4k ms‚àí1in the direction(Œ±, Œ¥)=(11.2h,‚àí7‚ó¶), between the constellations of Leo andCrater. Of course, the Sun is orbiting the Galaxy, and the Milky Way is moving within theLocal Group of galaxies. When these motions are accounted for, the peculiar motion of theLocal Group relative to the Hubble Ô¨Çow is about 627 km s‚àí1toward(Œ±, Œ¥)=(11.1h,‚àí27‚ó¶),in the middle of the constellation Hydra. From this observation and measurements of thevelocities of other galaxies and clusters of galaxies, astronomers have discovered a large-scale streaming motion of thousands of galaxies at‚àº600 km s‚àí1in the direction of(Œ±, Œ¥)=(13.3h,‚àí44‚ó¶)in the constellation Centaurus. The Hydra‚ÄìCentaurus supercluster is alsobeing carried along in this riverlike perturbation of the Hubble Ô¨Çow.After the dipole anisotropy has been subtracted from the CMB, the remaining radiationis incredibly isotropic, having nearly equal intensity in all directions. Sensitive instruments,however, have revealed that the CMB does have hotter and cooler areas. The CMB appearsas a patchwork of small regions, about 1‚ó¶degree or less in diameter, where the temperaturedeparts from the average value (T0) by about one part in 105. Careful observations andanalyses of these regions by WMAP and various ground-based and balloon-borne experi-ments have produced the Ô¨Årst precision measurement of cosmological parameters.

WewillcontinuetousetheWMAPvaluesoftheseparametersthroughoutthischapter.The Sunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovich EffectIt should be emphasized that an observer in a galaxy being carried along with the HubbleÔ¨Çow (no peculiar velocity) does not measure a Doppler shift of the CMB. An observer in adistant galaxy receding from us at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light sees the sameCMB spectrum that we do. Evidence of this is produced when low-energy photons of theCMB pass through the hot (‚âÉ108K) ionized intracluster gas in a rich cluster of galaxies.A small fraction (typically 10‚àí3to 10‚àí2) of the photons are scattered to higher energiesby the high-energy electrons in the gas. Thisinverse Compton scatteringincreases thefrequency of a scattered photon by an average amountœáDeltaœÜŒΩofœáDeltaœÜŒΩŒΩ=4kTemec2,(63)whereTeisthetemperatureoftheelectrongas.TheresultingdistortionoftheCMBspectrum,showninFig.11,iscalledthethermalSunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovicheffect[named for two Russians, astrophysicist Rashid Sunyaev and physicist Yakov Zel‚Äôdovich(1914‚Äì1987)].15Although the spectrum no longer has the precise shape of a blackbody,its translation to higher frequencies may be used to deÔ¨Åne an effective decreaseœáDeltaœÜTin thetemperatureT0of the CMB of approximately16œáDeltaœÜTT0‚âÉ‚àí2kTemec2œÑ(64)whereœÑis the optical depth of the intracluster gas along the line of sight. Typical valuesofœáDeltaœÜT /T0are a few times 10‚àí4. Observations of the Sunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovich effect for manyclusters of galaxies conÔ¨Årm that it is independent of the cluster‚Äôs redshift, as expected if theCMB spectrum observed at a cluster is not affected by the cluster‚Äôs recessional velocity.Figure 12 shows the Sunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovich effect surrounding two clusters of galaxies. Inaddition to conÔ¨Årming the cosmological nature of the CMB, the Sunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovich effectis a promising probe of the properties and evolution of rich clusters of galaxies in the earlyuniverse.Does the CMB Constitute a Preferred Frame of Reference?It may seem to you that the frame of reference in which the CMB appears isotropic is apreferred frame of reference that istruly motionless, in violation of the postulates of specialrelativity.Weshouldremember,however,thatgeneralrelativityisconcernedwithlocalinertial reference frames.There is no single frame15If the cluster has a peculiar velocity, the bulk motion of the intracluster gas produces an additional Doppler shiftof the scattered photons. This smaller perturbation of the CMB spectrum is called the kinetic Sunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovicheffect.16The leading coefÔ¨Åcient in Eq. ( 64) is equal to‚àí2 only on the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans (long-wavelength) side of thespectrum.Cosmology

In a rich cluster of galaxies, CMB photons may be scatteredto higher frequencies by colliding with the electrons in the hot intracluster gas. For frequencies lessthan the peak frequency, more photons are scattered out of a frequency interval than into it, so theintensity at that frequency decreases. Similarly, for frequencies greater than the peak frequency, fewerphotons are scattered out of a frequency interval than into it, so the intensity at that frequency increases.The net result is a shift of the CMB spectrum to higher frequencies. The calculated distortion has beenexaggerated by employing a Ô¨Åctional cluster 1000 times more massive than a typical rich cluster ofgalaxies. (Figure adapted from Carlstrom, Holder, and Reese,Annu.

Although we can deÔ¨Åne a localreference frame at rest relative to the glow of the CMB, we can also deÔ¨Åne a local referenceframe at rest relative to the motions of nearby stars (the local standard of rest).Both of these local inertial reference frames measure velocities relative toan arbitrary standard of rest and do not violate the tenets of relativity.A Two-Component Model of the UniverseRecall that in Section 1 we considered the expansion of a universe with a single compo-nent, pressureless dust, that was slowing down due to its own self-gravity. According to therelativistic equivalence of mass and energy, however, the effect of the cosmic microwavebackground on the expansion must also be included. In fact, we now know that the gravita-tional effect of the CMB photons dominated the dynamics of the early universe, althoughtheir effect is completely negligible in the present universe.Cosmology

(Figure adapted from Jones et al.,MNRAS,357, 518,2005.)To incorporate this new feature, we introduce a two-component model of the universe,one that includes both the total density of matter (baryonic and dark),œÅm, and the equiv-alent mass density of relativistic particles (such as neutrinos and CMB photons),œÅrel.I tis the equation of stateP=wu(Eq. 52) that determines whether we count a particleas matter (wm=0), a relativistic particle (a photon or neutrino, for whichwrel=1/3), or(in Section 3) dark energy (wœáLambdaœÜ=‚àí1). (The gravitational effect of the neutrinos‚Äô massclearly persists; however, we will neglect the neutrinos‚Äô contribution to the value ofœáOmegaœÜm,0of roughly 0.003.)Equation ( 53) shows that particles belonging to different categories are diluted dif-ferently by the expansion of the universe. Of course, at earlier epochs when the universewas much hotter, even massive particles were relativistic. For example, an electron gas atT>6√ó109K haskT > mec2, implying that the electron gas is relativistic and its equa-tionofstateisdescribedbywrel=1/3.However,wewillignoresuchcomplicationsfortheremainderofthischapterandwillconsiderphotonsandneutrinosasouronlyrelativisticparticles.With both matter and relativistic particles included, Eq.

Thusgrad=2(68)for photons, as expected.Neutrino DecouplingWe will neglect the small mass of the other relativistic particle we are considering, the neu-trino, and treat it as a massless particle.

Thetotal energy density of all three Ô¨Çavors is given byuŒΩ=3√ó78√óaT4ŒΩ=2.625aT4ŒΩ,(69)where the 7/8 derives from the ‚Äú+1‚Äù in the expression for Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics, andTŒΩis the temperature of the neutrinos.

We therefore recovergŒΩ=3√ó2√ó1=6.Cosmology

The usualTin cosmology is always taken to be the temperature of the blackbodyphotons. However, theTŒΩin Eq. ( 70) is the temperature of the neutrinos. ForT>3.5√ó1010K, these temperatures are the same, andT=TŒΩ. However, as the temperaturedropped below about 3.5√ó1010K, the expansion of the universe diluted the number densityof neutrinos, and the neutrinos ceased to interact with other particles. Essentially, the cosmosexpanded faster than the neutrino interaction rate, and the neutrinos decoupled from theother constituents of the universe. Since the time ofneutrino decoupling, the neutrinoshave expanded and cooled at their own rate, independently of the CMB.The Energy Density of Relativistic ParticlesBecause the annihilation of electrons with positrons continued to supply energy to the pho-tons (viae‚àí+e+‚ÜíŒ≥+Œ≥) but not to the neutrinos, the neutrino temperature is somewhatless than the temperature of the CMB photons. Although it is beyond the scope of this book,it can be shown thatTŒΩis related to the temperatureTof the CMB photons byTŒΩ=/parenleftbigg411/parenrightbigg1/3T.(73)The total neutrino energy density is thereforeuŒΩ=12/parenleftbigg78/parenrightbigggŒΩ/parenleftbigg411/parenrightbigg4/3aT4=0.681aT4.(74)Thus the energy density for relativistic particles, both photons and neutrinos, isurel=12g‚àóT4,(75)whereg‚àó=grad+/parenleftbigg78/parenrightbigggŒΩ/parenleftbigg411/parenrightbigg4/3=3.363(76)is theeffective number of degrees of freedomof the relativistic particles.

Big Bang NucleosynthesisThe process that manufactured the lightest elements in the early universe is known asBigBang nucleosynthesis. We are now prepared to ask, why is approximately one-quarterof the mass of the universe in the form of helium? The temperature at timetduring theradiation era is given by Eq. ( 89). At a temperature just below 1012K(t‚àº10‚àí4s),the universe contained a mixture of photons (Œ≥), electron‚Äìpositron pairs, and electron andmuon neutrinos and their antiparticles (ŒΩe,ŒΩ¬µ,ŒΩe,ŒΩ¬µ). There were also a smaller numberof protons and neutrons, about Ô¨Åve for every 1010photons, that were constantly beingtransformed into each other via the reactionsn/harpoonleftrightp++e‚àí+ŒΩe(93)n+e+/harpoonleftrightp++ŒΩe(94)n+ŒΩe/harpoonleftrightp++e‚àí.(95)These constant conversions were easily accomplished because the mass difference betweena proton and a neutron is only(mp‚àímn)c2=1.293 MeV,while the characteristic thermal energy of particles at 1012Ki skT‚âÉ86 MeV . The Boltz-mann equation gives the equilibrium ratio of the number density of neutrons,nn,to the number density of protons,np, asnnnp=e‚àí(mp‚àímn)c2/kT.(96)At 1012K, this ratio is 0.985. The numbers of neutrons and protons were nearly equalbecause the mass difference between the protons and neutrons is negligible at such a hightemperature.As the universe expanded and the temperature fell, the ratio of the number densities con-tinuedtobegivenbyEq.(96)aslongasreactions(93‚Äì95)proceededfastenoughto reach equilibrium. Detailed calculations show, however, that when the temperature haddeclined to about 1010K, the timescale for these reactions exceeded the characteristictimescale of the expansion given by 1/H(t)=2t.At a bit above 1010K, the reaction rates decreased signiÔ¨Åcantly, for two reasons. First,the expansion had reduced the energy of the neutrinos until they were unable to participatein reactions (93‚Äì95).

of the universe. The ratio of the number densities then became ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù at its value ofnn/np=0.223 whenT‚âÉ1010K.At this point, there were 223 neutrons for every 1000 protons (or 446 neutrons for every2000 protons, which will be used in what follows), and essentially no more neutrons werebeing created. The beta decay reaction [the forward reaction in Eq. ( 93)] continuedto operate, however, converting neutrons into protons with a half-life ofœÑ1/2=614 s=10.2 min. It was not yet possible for the protons and neutrons to combine to form deuteriumnuclei (21H) viap++n/harpoonleftright21H+Œ≥,because at temperatures exceeding 109K, the energetic radiation quickly dissociated thenuclei.Asaresult,theneutronsandprotonsremainedseparateduntilthetemperaturehaddroppedfrom1010Kt o1 09K.AccordingtoEq.(89)withg‚àó=3.363,thistookapproximatelyt(109K)‚àít(1010K)=178 s‚àí1.78 s‚âà176 s.From the law of radioactive decay,in this amount of time the 446 neutronsmentionedpreviouslydeclinedto366,andthenumberofprotonsroseto2080.Below109Ktheneutronsandprotonsreadilycombinedtoformasmanydeuteriumnucleiaspossible.Anumberofreactionsthenledtotheformationof42He, the most tightlyboundnucleusinvolvedinBigBangnucleosynthesis.ThemostefÔ¨Åcientreactionsleadingto42He include21H+21H/harpoonleftright31H+11H31H+21H/harpoonleftright42He+nand21H+21H/harpoonleftright32He+n32He+21H/harpoonleftright42He+11H.[Note that these reactions differ from those of the pp chain,whichproduceheliuminthecoresofstars.]Noothernucleiwereformedwithabundancesapproachingthatof42He, although there were traces of21H,32He, and73Li(fromthereaction42He+31H‚Üí73Li+Œ≥).Figure13showsthenetworkofreactionsinvolvedinBigBangnucleosynthesis.Oursampleof366neutronsand2080protonscouldform18342He nuclei,with1714protons(11H)leftover.Becausea42Henucleusisfourtimesmoremassivethana11Hnucleus,theprecedinganalysisshowsthatthemassfractionof42Heintheuniverseshould have been about4(183)1714+4(183)=0.299.The most obvious route to helium-4 is21H+21H/harpoonleftright42He+Œ≥.

D,61, 123505, 2000.)This rough estimate is consistent with the primordial percentage of helium inferred fromobservations, between 23% and 24%.Because essentially all of the available neutrons were incorporated in the helium-4 (42He)nuclei, the abundance of helium-4 was insensitive to the density of the universe at the time.However, the amounts of deuterium, helium-3, and lithium-7 manufactured in this waydepend sensitively on the density of ordinary matter at the time of the reactions. Figure 14shows the abundances of these nuclei as a function of the prevailingpresentdensity ofbaryonic matter.

When we observe the cosmic microwave background, what are weactually viewing? The copious electrons in the hot environment of the very early universeobstructed the photons of the cosmic microwave background, allowing them to travel onlyrelatively short distances before being scattered. The scattering of photons by free electronskept the electrons and photons in thermal equilibrium, meaning that they had the sametemperature.

The loss of free electrons and the resulting dropin opacity completed the decoupling of radiation and matter, freeing the photons to roamunhindered throughout a newly transparent universe. The photons of the cosmic microwavebackground that we observe today were last scattered during the time of recombination.The Surface of Last ScatteringWe deÔ¨Åne thesurface of last scatteringas a spherical surface, centered on the Earth, fromwhich the CMB photons just now arriving at Earth were last scattered before beginningtheir unimpeded journey to us. (Of course, other observers in the universe are at the centersof their own surfaces of last scattering.) The surface of last scattering is the farthest redshiftwe can possibly observe at this moment in time. More accurately, because recombinationdid not happen all at once, the surface of last scattering has a thicknessœáDeltaœÜz. Just as the lightfrom the Sun was last scattered from somewhere within its photosphere, the CMB photonsoriginated within a layer, the ‚Äúsurface‚Äù of last scattering.20The surface of last scatteringcan therefore be thought of as a curtain that screens everything prior to decoupling fromthe direct view of astronomers. The earliest moments of the universe are hidden behind thisveil and must be investigated indirectly.The Conditions at RecombinationThe temperature at recombination can be estimated through use of the Saha equation,NIINI=2ZIIneZI/parenleftbigg2œÄmekTh2/parenrightbigg3/2e‚àíœáI/kT.Assuming (incorrectly) a composition of pure hydrogen for simplicity, we useZI=2 andZII=1.It is useful to deÔ¨Ånefto be the fraction of hydrogen atomsthat are ionized, sof=NIINI+NII=NII/NI1+NII/NI,(97)orNIINI=f1‚àíf.(98)20The difference between the Sun‚Äôs photosphere and the surface of last scattering is that the photosphere has aspatial thickness, while the surface of last scattering has a thickness in terms of redshift or, equivalently, time.Cosmology

For ionized hydrogen there is one free electron for every proton,ne=np, so the numberdensity of free electrons depends onfasne=np=f (np+nH)=fœÅbmH,(99)whereœÅbis the density of baryonic matter. Note that in obtaining Eq. ( 99) fromEq. ( 97),NIcorresponds tonH, the number density of neutral hydrogen atoms, andNIIcorresponds tonp, the number density of protons (ionized hydrogen atoms). UsingEq. ( 82), we can write this asne(R)=fœÅb,0mHR3,(100)Substituting Eqs. ( 98) and ( 100) into the Saha equation, together with Eq.

This can be solved numerically to Ô¨Ånd that theuniverse had cooled sufÔ¨Åciently for one-half of its electrons and protons to combine toform atomic hydrogen (f=0.5) when the value of the scale factor was approximatelyR‚âà7.25√ó10‚àí4(z‚âà1380), corresponding to a temperature of about 3760 K [again fromEq. ( 58)].More precisely, the WMAP value for the redshift at the time of decoupling (i.e., thesurface of last scattering) is[zdec]WMAP=1089¬±1.We will adopt this as the value of the redshift for both recombination and decoupling. UsingEqs. ( 4) and ( 58) yields a temperature at recombination ofTdec=T0(1+zdec)=2970 K.This is lower than our estimate of 3760 K because the photons created by the formationof some atoms were then absorbed by other atoms, putting these atoms into excited statesfrom which they were easier to ionize. Thus a slightly cooler temperature was neededto complete the recombination process. It is important to remember that at times earlierthan recombination, the radiation and matter shared a common temperature, whereas afterrecombination, the temperatures of the radiation and matter must be distinguished. For theremainder of the text, it is the radiation temperature (the temperature of the CMB) that willbe of interest after recombination.The WMAP value for the time at which recombination and decoupling occurred is[tdec]WMAP=379+8‚àí7kyr.(102)Cosmology

Of course, these events did not occur at a single instant of time; the WMAP value of thedecoupling time interval is[œáDeltaœÜtdec]WMAP=118+3‚àí2kyr.This corresponds to the surface of last scattering having a thickness (in redshift) of[œáDeltaœÜzdec]WMAP=195¬±2.The Dawn of Precision CosmologyBefore ending this section, it is worth taking a few moments to reÔ¨Çect on the power ofsimple mathematics to illuminate the earliest stages of the universe. Before the discovery ofthe cosmic microwave background, theorizing about the early universe was not consideredto be legitimate science by many physicists. The point is well made by Steven Weinberg inhis bookThe First Three Minutes:This is often the way it is in physics‚Äîour mistake is not that we take ourtheories too seriously, but that we do not take them seriously enough. It isalways hard to realize that these numbers and equations we play with at ourdesks have something to do with the real world....The most important thingaccomplished by the ultimate discovery of the 3‚ó¶K radiation background in1965 was to force us all to take seriously the idea that therewasan earlyuniverse.The results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe have now taken cosmology toa level that was hardly imaginable when the Ô¨Årst edition ofAn Introduction to ModernAstrophysicswas published in 1996. In remarks made at the WMAP press conference onFebruary 11, 2003, astrophysicist John Bahcall said,Every astronomer will remember where he or she was when they Ô¨Årst heard theWMAP results. I certainly will....For cosmology, the formal announcementtoday represents a ‚Äúrite of passage‚Äù from speculation to precision science.RELATIVISTIC COSMOLOGYThe appearance of objects at truly cosmological distances is affected by the curvature of thespacetime through which the light travels on its way to Earth. The geometrical propertiesof the universe as a whole will be best understood by starting with simple analogies beforeproceeding to the more comprehensive description that only Einstein‚Äôs general theory ofrelativity can provide.Euclidean, Elliptic, and Hyperbolic GeometriesThe foundations of plane geometry (appropriate for a Ô¨Çat universe) were laid by Euclidsometime around 300b.c.Euclid‚ÄôsElementsconsists of 13 ‚Äúbooks‚Äù (chapters) that contain465 theorems. These theorems, in turn, are derived from just Ô¨Åve postulates that embodyself-evident truths and so are stated without proof. In Euclid‚Äôs words,Cosmology

It is possible to describe a circle with any center and distance [radius].4. All right angles are equal to one another.Euclid‚Äôs statement of his Ô¨Åfth postulate is awkward and opaque:5. If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the sameside less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indeÔ¨Ånitely, meeton the side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.A moment‚Äôs thought will show that Euclid‚Äôs Ô¨Åfth postulate concerns the behavior of parallellines.21It is equivalent to the following statement, due to an English mathematician, JohnPlayfair (1748‚Äì1819):5a. Given, in a plane, a lineLand a pointPnot onL, then throughPthere exists oneand only one line parallel toL.Figure 15(a) illustrates Playfair‚Äôs version of the parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry.The cumbersome statement of Euclid‚Äôs Ô¨Åfth postulate led some mathematicians to sus-pect that it might be derived from the Ô¨Årst four. In the nineteenth century, mathematiciansmounted an attack on the parallel postulate by denying it, in hopes that they would reach acontradiction. Such a proof by contradiction would make the Ô¨Åfth postulate dependent on therest of geometry and so abolish its stature as an independent postulate. To their astonishment,instead of arriving at a contradiction as they expected, several renowned mathematiciansrealized that they had developedalternativegeometries, each as self-consistent as Euclid‚Äôs.

Foremost among these mathematicians were Carl Frederich Gauss (1777‚Äì1855), NikolaiLobachevski (1793‚Äì1856), J√°nos Bolyai (1802‚Äì1860), and Bernhard Riemann (1826‚Äì1866). There arethreedifferent Ô¨Åfth postulates, each of which leads to a perfectly well-behaved geometry. In 1868 it was proved that the two additional, non-Euclidean geometriesare as logically consistent as Euclid‚Äôs original version. In addition to Playfair‚Äôs version ofthe parallel postulate given above for Euclidean geometry, there is the Ô¨Åfth postulate of theelliptic geometry developed by Riemann:5b. Given, in a plane, a lineLand a pointPnot onL, then throughPthere existsnolineparallel toL.As Fig. 15(b) shows, this describes the geometry of the surface of a sphere, where twolines that both start out perpendicular to the sphere‚Äôs equator meet at its poles. In ellipticgeometry, the angles of a triangle add up tomorethan 180‚ó¶, and the circumference of acircle is less than 2œÄr.On the other hand, the Ô¨Åfth postulate of the hyperbolic geometry, developed indepen-dently by Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevski, is more generous than Euclid‚Äôs:5c. Given, in a plane, a lineLand a pointPnot onL, then throughPthere existat leasttwo linesparallel toL.Figure 15(c) shows this geometry applied to a saddle-shaped hyperboloid. Neither ofthe two lines shown passing through pointPintersects the lineL, and it is possible to draw(in this example) inÔ¨Ånitely many more. In hyperbolic geometry, the angles of a triangle addup tolessthan 180‚ó¶, and the circumference of a circle exceeds 2œÄr.The logical independence of the parallel postulate means that it cannot be derived fromEuclid‚Äôs earlier postulates. Which geometry to adopt is an arbitrary choice, since all threeare equally valid from a mathematical viewpoint. Which of these three geometries describesthe spatial structure of the physical universe is a question that must be answeredempirically,by observation. Gauss himself conducted such an experiment beginning in 1820, when hedirected a survey of the Germanic state of Hanover. After carefully measuring the distancesbetween three mountaintops that formed a huge triangle (the longest side was 107 km),he determined that the sum of the triangle‚Äôs angles was 180‚ó¶‚Äîwithin experimental error.Gauss‚Äôs experiment was not sensitive enough to measure the curvature of space near Earth‚Äôssurface.The Robertson‚ÄìWalker Metric for Curved SpacetimeThe spacetime surrounding any massive object is indeed curved.ThespatialcurvatureisrevealedintheradialtermoftheSchwarzschildmetricHowever, the Schwarzschild metric is valid only outside matter. We will haveto Ô¨Ånd another metric to describe the spacetime of the dust-Ô¨Ålled universe of Section 1.Although a derivation of this metric is beyond the scope of this book, the following ar-gument should help elucidate some of its properties. Our search for the metric is madesomewhat easier by the cosmological principle. In a homogeneous and isotropic universe,although the curvature of space may change with time, the curvature must have the samevalue everywhere at a given time since the Big Bang.Cosmology

Let‚Äôs begin by considering the curvature of a two-dimensional surface. ‚ÄúCurvature‚Äù hasa precise mathematical meaning; for example, a sphere of radiusRhas a constant curvature,K, that is deÔ¨Åned to beK‚â°1/R2. Gauss realized that the curvature of any surface can bedeterminedlocally, on an arbitrarily small patch of its surface. It is instructive to imaginehow the curvature of a sphere of radiusRmight be measured by a tiny (but talented) anton the sphere‚Äôs surface. It is free to roam about the sphere‚Äôs surface but is unable to gain anoutside perspective and view the sphere as a whole. How could the inquisitive ant determinethe sphere‚Äôs curvature?Starting at the north pole of the sphere (call this pointP; see Fig. 16), the ant couldmark a series of other points all of which are a distanceDfromP. When connected, thesepoints form a circle withPat its center. The ant now measures the circumference,Cmeas,of the circle and compares it with the expected value ofCexp=2œÄD. However, the twovalues do not agree; sinceD=RŒ∏,Cexp=2œÄRŒ∏whileCmeas=2œÄRsinŒ∏=2œÄRsin(D/R).When the ant divides the fractional discrepancy between these two values of the circumfer-ence by the expected area of the circle,Aexp=œÄD2, and then multiplies by 6œÄ, the result(in the limitD‚Üí0) is the curvature of the sphere. That is, the ant starts with6œÄ¬∑Cexp‚àíCmeasCexpAexp=6œÄ¬∑2œÄD‚àíCmeas(2œÄD)(œÄD2)=3œÄ2œÄD‚àíCmeasD3.

Equation ( 104) shows the effect of the curvature of our three-dimensional universeon spatial distances. Although the curvature of a two-dimensional spherical surface can beseen by stepping back from the sphere and viewing it immersed in its three-dimensionalsurroundings, there is unfortunately no fourth spatial dimension into which we can stepback to view the curvature of our universe.The Ô¨Ånal step toward the spacetime metric comes from recalling that by ‚Äúdistance,‚Äù wemean theproper distancebetween two spacetime events that occur simultaneously accord-ing to an observer. In an expanding universe, the positions of two points must be recordedat the same time if their separation is to have any meaning. In an isotropic, homogeneousuniverse, there is no reason why time should pass at different rates at different locations;consequently, the temporal term should simply becdt.23If we take(ds)2=(c dt)2‚àí/parenleftbiggdr‚àö1‚àíKr2/parenrightbigg2‚àí(r dŒ∏)2‚àí(rsinŒ∏d œÜ )2asthemetricforanisotropic,homogeneousuniverse,thenfortheproperdistanceagreeswithEq.(104).Thatis,thedifferentialproperdistanceisjustdL=/radicalbig‚àí(ds)2withdt=0.All that remains is to express this metric in terms of the dimensionless scale factor,R(t),deÔ¨Åned byr(t)=R(t)œñ(Eq. 3).

Later, after the expansion of the universe had been discovered, Einsteinexpressed his regret at including theœáLambdaœÜ-term in his Ô¨Åeld equations and has been quoted asreferring to it as ‚Äúthe biggest blunder of my life.‚ÄùA nonzero cosmological constant implies that space would be curved even in an emptyuniverse that is devoid of matter, an idea that Einstein disliked because it conÔ¨Çicted withhis ideas concerning mass as the cause of spacetime curvature.

This derivation shows that the cosmological redshift is due to the wavelength of a photonexpanding along with the space through which the photon moves during its journey to Earth.Equation(142)isjustEq.(4)discussedpreviously.CombiningEqs.(141)and(142)results in the formula forcosmological time dilation,œáDeltaœÜt0œáDeltaœÜte=1+z.(143)Note that these relations for the cosmological redshift and time dilation hold regardless of thefunctional form of the scale factor,R(t). Experimental conÔ¨Årmation of cosmological timedilation has been frustrated by the lack of a reliable natural clock located at cosmologicaldistances. However, a measurement of cosmological time dilation has been made using thetemporal changes in the spectrum of a moderate-redshift (z=0.361) Type Ia supernova.The results were consistent with Eq. ( 143). [See Foley et al. (2005) for details of thismeasurement of cosmological time dilation.]Distances to the Most Remote Objects in the UniverseTo make further progress in our quest to survey the universe and determine its geometry anddynamics, we must next learn how to measure the distance to objects in the most remoteregions of the universe. The proper distance of an object from Earth can be found fromtheRobertson‚ÄìWalkermetric.Recallthatthedifferentialproperdistanceisjust/radicalbig‚àí(ds)2withdt=0. Furthermore, if the comoving coordinate of the object isœñ(withEarth atœñ=0), thendŒ∏=dœÜ=0 along a radial line from Earth to the object. Insertingthese into the Robertson‚ÄìWalker metric (Eq. 106), we can Ô¨Ånd the proper distance,dp(t),to the object at timetby integratingdp(t)=R(t)/integraldisplayœñ0dœñ‚Ä≤‚àö1‚àíkœñ‚Ä≤2.(144)Using Eq. ( 138), this becomesdp(t)=R(t)/integraldisplayt0tecdt‚Ä≤R(t‚Ä≤).(145)The physical meaning of this is readily apparent. As the photon moves in fromœñe, in eachinterval of timedtit travels a small distance ofcdt. These intervals cannot simply be addedup, because the universe expands as the photon travels. Dividingcdtby the scale factorat the time,R(t), converts this small distance to what it would be at the present time,t0.Integrating then yields the proper distance fromœñetoœñ=0 today, at timet0. Multiplyingby the scale factorR(t)then converts this to the distance at some other timet. It is worthemphasizing that the current value of the proper distance,dp,0‚â°dp(t0), to an object is howfar away it istoday, and not its distance when its light was emitted. As long as the object haszero peculiar velocity (constant comoving coordinateœñ), it sufÔ¨Åces to Ô¨Ånddp,0becauseCosmology

the proper distance at any other time can be obtained fromdp(t)=R(t)dp,0.(146)In particular, if the object‚Äôs redshift isz, then its distance at timete, when its light wasemitted, isdp(te)=dp,0R(te)=dp,01+z.(147)Integrating Eq. ( 144) and usingR(t0)=1 shows that the expression for the presentproper distance in a Ô¨Çat universe isdp,0=œñ(fork=0),(148)the expression for a closed universe isdp,0=1‚àöksin‚àí1(œñ‚àök)(fork>0),(149)and the expression for an open universe isdp,0=1‚àö|k|sinh‚àí1(œñ/radicalbig|k|)(fork<0).(150)In a Ô¨Çat universe, the present proper distance to an object is just its coordinate distancedc,0=œñ(cf. Eq. 3). However, the coordinate distance will not agree with the properdistance ifkÃ∏=0. Because sin‚àí1(x)‚â•x, in a closed universe (k>0) the proper distanceto an object isgreaterthan its coordinate distance. Similarly, sinh‚àí1(x)‚â§x, so in an openuniverse (k<0) the proper distance to an object islessthan its coordinate distance. Laterwe will Ô¨Ånd expressions for the proper distancedp,0and the comoving coordinateœñasfunctions of the redshiftz. First, however, we pause to examine the above equations fordp,0because measuring distances in an expanding universe has some interesting aspects.Distances in a closed universe (k>0) are especially interesting. Solving Eq. ( 149)forœñgivesœñ=1‚àöksin(dp,0‚àök).(151)Note that in a closed universe there is a maximum value of the comoving coordinate ofœñmax=1/‚àök. Also, there are an inÔ¨Ånite number of distances along a radial line to the samepointXin space, located, say, atœñX.I fdp,0is one value of the present proper distance toXat timet, then for any integern,dp,0+2œÄn/‚àökwill also bring us back toX, with the samevalue ofœñX. The extra multiples of 2œÄ/‚àökcorrespond to traversing the circumference ofthe universentimes before stopping atX. However, such a journey, running circles aroundthe universe, would not be physically possible. As it happens, a photon emitted att=0i na closed, matter-dominated universe withœáLambdaœÜ=0 would return to its starting point just asthe universe ended in a Big Crunch.Cosmology

In a similar manner, our tiny ant that lives on the surface of a sphere could walk from poleto pole to pole, encircling the spherentimes before proceeding on to its Ô¨Ånal destination.This illustrates that although there is no boundary to a closed universe, it contains onlya Ô¨Ånite amount of space, like the unbounded surface of a sphere. Furthermore, a closeduniverse curves back on itself; moving outward from Earth (or from any other choice oforigin), the farthest you can get from home is a point whereœñ=1/‚àök. From that point,a step inanydirection brings you closer to where you started.You should be warned that suggestive phrases like ‚Äúthe circumference of the universe‚Äùand ‚Äúcurves back on itself‚Äù do not imply a curved path through three-dimensional space,since there is no deviation from a radial line asœñincreases. Despite these caveats, we candeÔ¨Åne the circumference of a closed universe (including the time-dependence) asCuniv(t)=2œÄR(t)‚àök(152)which is the proper distance along a radial line that brings you back to your starting point.This expression for the circumference is consistent with our deÔ¨Ånition of curvature since,from Eq. ( 105), the radius of curvature of a closed universe at timetis 1/‚àöK(t)=R(t)/‚àök. Nevertheless, the radius of curvature must not be thought of as the radius of anactual circular path.The Particle Horizon and the Horizon DistanceAs the universe expands and ages, photons from increasingly distant objects have more timeto complete their journey to Earth. This means that as time increases, we might expect thatmore of the universe will come into causal contact with the observer. The proper distance tothe farthest observable point (called theparticle horizon) at timetis thehorizon distance,dh(t). Note that two points separated by a distance greater thandhare not in causal contact.Thusdhmay be thought of as thediameterof the largest causally connected region.We will now derive an expression fordh(t), the size of the observable universe as afunction of time. (It is important to note that because the farthest observable point movesoutward through increasingly larger values ofœñ,dh(t)isnotproportional toR(t).) Consideran observer at the origin (œñ=0), and let the particle horizon for this observer be locatedatœñeat timet. This means that a photon emitted atœñeatt=0 would reach the origin attimet. With an appropriate change of limits in Eq.

After the radiation era, the expansion of the universe was governed by the effects of matterand, later, dark energy.For the matter era, assuming a Ô¨Çat universe, the scale factor is given by Eq. ( 91), whichis of the formR(t)=Ct2/3, where againCis a constant. (Since the radiation era lastedonly 55,000 years following the Big Bang, for the purposes of the following calculationswe will ignore radiation and set the lower limit tot=0.) Substituting this into Eq. ( 153)results indh(t)=3ct(fork=0).(155)Using Eqs.

Of course, when viewing an object near the particle horizon, astronomerssee it as it was when the light was emitted, not as it would appear in today‚Äôs universe.Note that the distance to the particle horizon in Eqs.

The particle horizon will never catch up to any object that is presentlymore than 19.3 Gpc away, and so its light willneverreach us. What will we observe whenlooking at an object at the ultimate (t‚Üí‚àû) particle horizon? Although photons from theobject will continue to arrive, they will be increasingly deeply redshifted, and their arrivalrate will decline toward zero due to cosmological time dilation (Eq. 143). Thus the objectwill fade from view, apparently frozen in time, as its redshift diverges to inÔ¨Ånity.

In other words, the largest region that was causally connected att=178 sis now just over a kiloparsec across, roughly 8.7√ó10‚àí8of the present horizon distance,dh,0. This illustrates that as the early universe aged, the amount of material that is in causalcontact increased dramatically. Today‚Äôs causally connected universe extends far beyondCbecause, sincet=178 s, light from more distant regions has had time to arrive and causallyconnect those regions withC. The comoving boundary ofCcannot keep up with the morerapid recession of the particle horizon.The Arrival of PhotonsYou may be wondering, if the scale factorRwas zero at the Big Bang and everything wasright next to everything else, then why has it taken the age of the universe for a Big Bangphoton to reach Earth? What is the path followed by the photon?In the following discussion, the actual complications of the Big Bang will be neglected.Instead, we will consider a perfectly transparent, expanding, Ô¨Çat universe where a singlephoton is emitted at comoving coordinateœñeat timet=0. What, then, is the proper distanceof that photon from our position (œñ=0) at a later timet? The coordinate,œñ, of the photonat timetmay be found from Eq.

We can evaluateœñeby noting that att=t0,œñ=0; thusœñe=3ct0,(164)the present horizon distance for this model (Eq. 155). Inserting this value for the photon‚Äôsstarting point into Eq.

Indeed, the ‚ÄúBig Stretch‚Äù would be a more appropriate termthan the ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù for this event! As shown in Fig. 23, the initial expansion of theuniverse actually carried the photonawayfrom Earth. Although the photon‚Äôs comovingcoordinate was always decreasing from an initial value ofœñetoward Earth‚Äôs position atœñ=0, the scale factorR(t)increased so rapidly that at Ô¨Årst the proper distance betweenthe photon and Earth increased with time. This means that a photon emitted from the presentparticle horizon att=0 is only now reaching Earth.

The Maximum Visible Age of a SourceThe previous calculation assumes that the photon was emitted att=0. Is it possible thatthe exponential expansion of space could carry a presently visible object away from Earthso fast that the object would never again be seen in the sky from some future time forward?To answer this, consider an object (say, a galaxy) that is now visible, meaning that its lightwas emitted at an earlier timeteand it arrives today att0. Assuming that the galaxy is stillvisible at some time in the future, we will let the time of the emission of its future photonsbetiand their arrival time here betf, wherete<tiandt0<tf. Applying these conditionsto Eq. ( 140) gives/integraldisplayt0tedtR(t)=/integraldisplaytftidtR(t),(166)where the scale factorRis given by Eq. ( 131) for a Ô¨Çat universe (k=0). Because thescale factor increases monotonically, it may be, for sufÔ¨Åciently largeti, thatnovalue oftfcan satisfy this equality. In that case, a photon emitted at timetiwill never reach Earth. Thelatest time of emission,tmva, for photons to eventually reach us (themaximum visible ageof the source) may be found by settingtf=‚àû.33Just like an object located at the ultimate particle horizon, as photons from this galaxycontinue to arrive, they will be increasingly deeply redshifted and their Ô¨Çux will drop towardzero. The galaxy will fade from view, apparently frozen in time, as its redshift diverges toinÔ¨Ånity. The farther a source is, the sooner it will fade away. This places a fundamentallimit on extragalactic astronomy. We will never be able to watch galaxies continue to ageand evolve through the millenia. Figure 24 shows that if the redshift of an object isroughly larger than 1.8, thentmva<tH, and we will never see it even as it appearstoday.That is, the light emitted by the object today will never reach Earth because those photonswill eventually be carried away from us by the accelerating Hubble Ô¨Çow.

Similarly,any signal we send toward a galaxy withz‚âà1.8 or more will never arrive. Because therecan be no contact between that galaxy and Earth anytime in the future, we are no longer incausal contact with it.

The Proper DistanceWe have arrived at our goal, an approximate expression for the proper distance of an objectat the present time. According to Eq. ( 169), this isdp,0‚âÉczH0/bracketleftbigg1‚àí12(1+q0)z/bracketrightbigg(forz‚â™1). (181)The Ô¨Årst term is just the Hubble law, after applyingfor the redshift. Sinceq0=œáOmegaœÜm,0/2‚àíœáOmegaœÜœáLambdaœÜ,0, we see from the second term that larger values ofœáOmegaœÜm,0implysmallerdistances(moremasstoslowdowntheexpansionoftheuniverse),asdosmallervaluesofœáOmegaœÜœáLambdaœÜ,0(less dark energy pressure to speed up the expansion). As we shall see, the secondterm involves a departure from the linearity of the Hubble law that can be used to determinethe deceleration parameter,q0. Forq0=‚àí0.6, the second term is 10% of the Ô¨Årst whenz=0.13.The Luminosity DistanceNow we are ready for the concept of the luminosity distance (as measured by the inversesquarelaw).Thenwewillbepreparedtodescribesomeoftheclassicobservationaltestsofcosmologicalmodels.First,weassociatethesourceoftheemittedphotonswiththerateatwhichenergyarrivesatatelescope‚Äôsdetectors.SupposethataradiantÔ¨ÇuxFis measured for a source of light with a known luminosityL. (For now, we will assumethatFis a bolometric Ô¨Çux, measured over all wavelengths.) Then the inverse square lawcan be used to deÔ¨Åne theluminosity distance,dL, of the star byd2L‚â°L4œÄF.(182)Let a source of light be located at the origin (œñ=0) of a comoving coordinate system.The source emits photons that arrive at a spherical surface around the origin for whichœñ=constant>0. From the Robertson‚ÄìWalker metric, Eq. ( 106), the surface area ofthe sphere at the present time (R=1) is 4œÄœñ2; see Fig. 25. After traveling out toœñfrom the source, the photons will be spread over this surface area, and so the radiant Ô¨Çuxwill diminish as 1/œñ2. Two effects, in addition to the inverse square law, act to furtherreduce the value of the radiant Ô¨Çux measured at this sphere. The cosmological redshift,Eq. ( 142), shows that the energy of each photon,Ephoton=hc/Œª, is reduced by a factorof 1+z. Also, cosmological time dilation, Eq. ( 143), affects the average time intervalbetweenphotons emitted by the source. This means that the rate at which the photons arriveat the sphere is less than the rate at which they leave the source by another factor of 1+z.Combining these effects, the radiant Ô¨Çux at the sphere‚Äôs surface isF=L4œÄœñ2(1+z)2.We emphasize that although the surface area of a sphere centered at the origin is 4œÄ[R(t)œñ]2, the proper distanceof the surface from the origin isnotR(t)œñwhenkÃ∏=0; see Eqs.

parameter to be determined. At still largerz, the curve is sensitive to the individual valuesofœáOmegaœÜm,0andœáOmegaœÜœáLambdaœÜ,0.The cosmological redshift affects the measurement of an object‚Äôs spectrum becausethese observations are usually made within a speciÔ¨Åc wavelength region. For example,observations made in theV-band at 550 nm can be affected as the cosmological redshiftbrings shorter-wavelength radiation into theVband. This effect can be corrected for byadding a compensating term called theK-correctionto Eq. ( 188) if the spectrum,IŒª,o fthe object is known.In the mid-1990‚Äôs two rival teams of astronomers‚Äîthe Supernova Cosmology Project(SCP, led by Saul Perlmutter) and the High-Z Supernova Search Team (HZSNS Team,headed by Brian Schmidt)‚Äîmade observations of Type Ia supernovae at cosmological dis-tances. Both teams were astonished to discover that supernovae observed with a redshift ofz‚âà0.5 were about 0.25 magnitudedimmerthan expected for a universe withœáOmegaœÜm,0‚âÉ0.3andœáLambdaœÜ=0. The supernovae were farther away than they would be in this canonical decel-erating universe. The possibility of an accelerating universe and a nonzero cosmologicalconstant immediately leapt to their minds, but it took nearly a year of intense work to elim-inate several plausible alternative explanations. For example, about 20% of the light froma distant supernova could be absorbed at highzby a hypothetical‚Äúgray dust.‚ÄùOr perhapsevolutionary effects were misleading the astronomers, since at highzwe observe a youngergeneration of supernovae, formed in a younger galactic environment where heavy elementswere less abundant. One by one, these possibilities were considered and eliminated. Theredshift‚Äìmagnitude diagram in Fig. 27 shows a more recent compilation of the resultsof these two teams. Both groups found that their analyses ruled out aÔ¨Çat universe withœáOmegaœÜm,0=1 andœáLambdaœÜ=0 (the scenario championed by most theorists at the time) and were alsoincompatible with an open universe havingœáOmegaœÜm,0‚âÉ0.3 andœáLambdaœÜ=0. Instead, theirÔ¨Åndingsfavored a universe withœáOmegaœÜm,0‚âÉ0.3 andœáOmegaœÜœáLambdaœÜ,0=0.7. Figure 28 shows, for each team,the location on theœáOmegaœÜm,0‚ÄìœáOmegaœÜœáLambdaœÜ,0plane of the most likely set of values that are consistentwith the high-zsupernovae results. Their evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant ispersuasive.If we look at supernovae beyondzaccel=0.76, when the universe started accelerating,we shouldÔ¨Ånd the signature of a decelerating universe. Figure 29 shows further results ofobservations of high-zsupernovae, including six withz>1.25. It includes SN 1997ff, themost distant supernova yet observed atz=1.7. SN 1997ff and others in this high-zsampleappearbrighterthan they would if the universe had expanded at a constant rate (i.e., withœáOmegaœÜ=0), as expected for the deceleration phase of the early universe. These observationsrule out the alternative explanations of acceleration,‚Äúgray dust‚Äùand evolutionary effects,as indicated in theÔ¨Ågure. Clearly, astronomers will have to grapple with the implicationsof an accelerating universe whose dynamics are dominated by dark energy.It is perhaps surprising that the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the redshift‚Äìmagnitude diagrams (H0‚àº70¬±10 km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1) are not better determined. The spreadin the values ofH0obtained by various groups using supernovae is due to their differentcalibrations of Cepheid distances. This systematic uncertainty does not affect the valuesA‚Äúgray dust‚Äùof large grains would absorb light nearly equally at all wavelengths and so would produce nodetectable reddening of a supernova‚Äôs spectrum.37

The relative strengths of the lines indicate that the temperature of the cloud is7.4¬±0.8 K, and the lines show a redshift ofz=1.776. How does the temperature of thecloud compare with the temperature of the CMB at that redshift?

This energy cannot be lost or extracted from the electron, since there is no lower quantum state to which the electron can make a transition. The existence of the vacuum has been veriÔ¨Åed by observations of the Casimir effect (named for Dutch physicist Hendrick Casimir, 1909‚Äì2000). Two uncharged parallel Ô¨Çat conducting plates with a very small separation will alter the properties of the vacuum between the plates. This change in the vacuum creates an attractive force between the plates, which has been measured. Unfortunately, the Casimir effect cannot be used to calculate the value of the energy density of the vacuum.

PROBLEM SET1or the number density of blackbody photons:n=u2.70kT=aT32.70k.Use this result along with the baryon density,œÅb,0, to estimate the ratio of the number of baryonsto the number of photons in today‚Äôs universe. For convenience, assume that the universe ismade solely of hydrogen.2 (a)Suppose observations of the microlensing of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud showedthat most of the dark matter in the Milky Way‚Äôs dark halo is in the form of ordinary browndwarfs and Jupiter-sized objects. Explain whether this would favor hot or cold dark matterfor the nonbaryonic matter in the universe, and why.(b)In fact, observations indicate that this is probablynotthe case: Less than 20% of the MilkyWay‚Äôs dark halo is in the form of ordinary brown dwarfs and Jupiter-sized objects. Howdo these observations change the conclusion you reached in part (a)?3An example of spontaneous symmetry breaking can be obtained by considering a small ballof massm=1/9.8 kg that is free to roll on a surface whose height (in meters) is given byh(x)=kx2+Œµx4,wherek=¬±1m‚àí1andŒµ=0.5m‚àí3. The gravitational potential energy of the ball is thenV (x)=mgh(x).(a)Make two graphs ofV (x)fromx=‚àí2 m tox=2 m, one for each choice of sign fork.(b)The case ofk=1m‚àí1corresponds to the symmetric false vacuum. Where is the point ofequilibrium? Is this point stable or unstable? (In the case of stable equilibrium, if the ballis displaced slightly, it will return to the equilibrium point.)(c)The case ofk=‚àí1m‚àí1correspondstothebrokensymmetryofthetruevacuum.Wherearethe three points of equilibrium? Which of these points are stable, and which are unstable?(d)For the case ofk=‚àí1m‚àí1, consider the ball at rest at the origin. What are the implicationsoftheuncertaintyprinciple given in below equation fortheballremaininginthatposition?is this situation analogous to that of the supercooled false vacuum4Compare the energy density of CMB photons at the end of the GUTs epoch to that of the falsevacuum.5According to the standard Big Bang cosmology, what was the value of the scale factor,R,i nthe radiation era at the Planck time? When inÔ¨Çation is considered (taket/œÑi=100), what wasF
the value of the scale factor at the Planck time? For both situations, what was the size of thepresently observable universe at the Planck time?6Estimate the thickness of a typical cosmic string.The Early Universe

7 (a)Estimate the mass of baryonic matter contained within a causally connected region(diameter=the horizon distance) whenT=109K during the radiation era. Express youranswer in solar units. How does this compare with the Jeans mass shown in Fig. 7?
(b)Show that during the radiation era, the mass of the baryonic matter inside this causallyconnected region varied asT‚àí3. What does this say about the relative magnitudes of theregion‚Äôs mass and the Jeans mass throughout the radiation era?8Estimate the mass of baryonic matter contained within a causally connected region at the timeof the transition from the radiation era to the matter era. Express your answer in solar units.(For convenience, setœÜOmegaŒ∑0=1 andh=1.) From the magnitude of your answer, did most ofthe baryonic density Ô¨Çuctuations become sub-horizon-sized during the radiation era or duringthe matter era?9Show that if a baryonic density perturbation at the present time is(Œ¥œÅ/œÅ)0=1, then its valueat a redshiftzin the matter era wasŒ¥œÅ/œÅ=(1+z)‚àí1. By what factor does anyŒ¥œÅ/œÅ <1increase between a redshiftz1and a redshiftz2(z1>z2) in the matter era? You may assumethat the universe is nearly Ô¨Çat and thatz<1100 for baryonic Ô¨Çuctuations.10Follow the linearization procedureand show that the variations in thetemperatureoftheCMBarerelatedtothebaryonicdensityÔ¨ÇuctuationsbyEq.(30).11Assuming a Ô¨Çat universe, Ô¨Ånd the angular size of the largest causally connected region of theCMB.Hint:We see this region as it existed at the time of decoupling, when the CMB photonswere set free.12Estimate the value of‚Ñìwhen Silk damping becomes important for the angular power spectrumof the CMB anisotropies.13According to the WMAP CMB polarization results, how old was the universe when the Ô¨Årststars ignited?10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0024681012141618

The user is also asked to enterthe number of time steps desired for the calculation (perhaps 1000 to 100,000) and thefrequency with which the time steps are to be printed to the output Ô¨Åle (Orbit.txt). If1000 time steps are speciÔ¨Åed with a frequency of 10, then 100 evenly spaced (in time) timesteps will be printed.The output Ô¨Åle can be imported directly into a graphics or spreadsheet program in order togenerate a graph of the orbit. Note that it may be necessary to delete the header informationinOrbit.txtprior to importing the data columns into the graphics or spreadsheet program.The source code is available in both Fortran 95 and C++ versions.

APPENDIXTwoStars, A Binary Star Code
.A simple binary star code is developed in this appendix that incorporates a number ofthe basic features of more sophisticated codes.TwoStarsis designed to provide position,radial-velocity, and binary light curve information that can be used to determine masses (m1andm2from determination of the semimajor axes and periods of the orbits), radii (R1andR2by measuring eclipse times), effective temperature ratios (from the relative depths of theprimary and secondary minima), limb darkening, orbital eccentricity (e), orbital inclination(i), and orientation of periastron (œÜ). However, in order to greatly simplify the code, it isassumed that the two stars are strictly spherically symmetric, that they do not collide withone another, and that their surface Ô¨Çuxes vary only with stellar radius (i.e., there are noanomalous star spots or localized heating).To begin, assume that the orbits of the two stars lie in thex‚Äìyplane with the center ofmassofthesystemlocatedattheoriginofthecoordinatesystem,asshowninFig.1(thez-axis is out of the page). In order to generalize the orientation of the orbit, periastronfor Star 1 (the point in the orbit closest to the center of mass) is at an angleœÜmeasuredcounterclockwise from the positivex-axis and in the direction of the orbital motion. It isalso assumed that the orbital plane is inclined an angleiwith respect to the plane of thesky (they‚Ä≤‚Äìz‚Ä≤plane)asshowninFig.2.Thelineofsightfromtheobservertothecenterof mass is along thex‚Ä≤-axis, and the center of mass is located at the origin of the primedcoordinate system. Finally, they‚Ä≤-axis is directed out of the page and is aligned with they-axisofFig.1.It is a straightforward process to show that the transformation between the two coordinatesystems is given byx‚Ä≤=zcosi+xsini(1)y‚Ä≤=y(2)z‚Ä≤=zsini‚àíxcosi,(3)which of course simpliÔ¨Åes signiÔ¨Åcantly for the case where the centers of mass lie along thex‚Äìyplane (i.e.,z=0).From Appendix K o f An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicSecond Edition, Bradley W. Carroll, Dale A. Ostlie. Copyright ¬©2007 Pearson Education, Inc. Published by Pearson Addison-Wesley. All rights reserved.by s, Binary star systems play a very important role in determining various stellar properties, including masses and radii. In addition, analyses using sophisticated binary-star modeling codes can provide information about variations in surface Ô¨Çux such as limb darkening and the presence of star spots or reÔ¨Çective heating. Advanced codes can also detail the effects of gravitational tidal interactions and centrifugal forces that result in stars that deviate (some-times signiÔ¨Åcantly) from spherical symmetry.

APPENDIXStatStar, A Stellar Structure CodeStatStaris based on the equations of stellar structure and the constitutive relations.AnexampleoftheoutputgeneratedbyStatStaris availableon the companion website.StatStaris designed to illustrate as clearly as possible many of the most importantaspects of numerical stellar astrophysics. To accomplish this goal,StatStarmodels arerestricted to a Ô¨Åxed composition throughout [in other words, they are homogeneous zero-agemain-sequence models (ZAMS)].The four basic stellar structure equations are computed in the functionsdPdr,dMdr,dLdr,anddTdrThe density [œÅ(r)=rho] is calculated directly from the ideal gas law and the radiationpressureequationinFUNCTION Opacity,g i v e nl o c a lv a l u e sf o rt h ep r e s s u r e[P (r)=P],temperature[T (r)=T], and mean molecular weight (¬µ=mu, assumed heretobeforacompletely ionized gas only). Once the density is determined, both the opacity[Œ∫(r)=kappa] and the nuclear energy generation rate [œµ(r)=epsilon] are calculated.The opacity is determined inFUNCTION Opacityusing the bound‚Äìbound and bound‚Äìfreeopacityformulae,together with electron scatteringandH‚àíioncontributions.TheenergygenerationrateiscalculatedinFunction Nuclearfrom the equations for the total pp chainandtheCNOThe program begins by asking the user to supply the desired stellar mass (Msolar, insolar units), the trial effective temperature (Teff, in kelvins), the trial luminosity (Lsolar,also in solar units), and the mass fractions of hydrogen (X) and metals (Z). Using the stellarstructure equations, the program proceeds to integrate from the surface of the star toward thecenter, stopping when a problem is detected or when a satisfactory solution is obtained. Ifthe inward integration is not successful, a new trial luminosity and/or effective temperaturemustbechosen.stellarstructureexistsforag i v e nm a s sa n dc o m p o s i t i o n .S a t i s f y i n gt h ec e n t r a lb o u n d a r yconditionsthereforerequiresspeciÔ¨Åcsurfaceboundaryconditions.Itisforthisreasonthatawell-deÔ¨Ånedmainsequenceexists.Since it is nearly impossible to satisfy the central boundary conditions exactly by thecrudeshooting methodemployed byStatStar, the calculation is terminated when thecore is approached.

Rminare speciÔ¨Åed as fractions of the surface mass (Ms), luminosity (Ls), and radius (Rs),respectively. Once the criteria for halting the integration are detected, the conditions at thecenter of the star are estimated by an extrapolation procedure.StatStarmakes the simplifying assumptions that the pressure, temperature, and densityare all zero at the surface of the star. As a result, it is necessary to begin the calculationwith approximations to the basic stellar structure equations. This can be seen by notingthat the mass, pressure, luminosity, and temperature gradients are all proportional to thedensity and are therefore exactly zero at the surface. Curiously, it would appear that applyingthese gradients in their usual form implies that the fundamental physical parameters cannotchange from their initial values, since the density would remain zero at each step!One way to overcome this problem is to assume that the interior mass and luminosity areboth constant through a small number of surface zones. In the case of the luminosity, this isclearly a valid assumption since temperatures are not sufÔ¨Åcient to produce nuclear reactionsnear the surfaces of ZAMS stars; and furthermore, since ZAMS stars are static, changesin gravitational potential energy are necessarily zero. For the interior mass, the assumptionis not quite as obvious. However, we will see that in realistic stellar models, the density isso low near the surface that the approximation is indeed very reasonable. Of course, it isimportant to verify that the assumptions are not being violated to within speciÔ¨Åed limits.Given the surface valuesMr=MsandLr=Ls, and assuming that the surface zone isradiative,which leadstodPdT=16œÄac3GMsLsT3Œ∫.Since relatively few free electrons exist in the thin outer atmospheres of stars, electronscattering and H‚àíion contributions to the opacity will be neglected in the surface zoneapproximation.

APPENDIXGalaxy, A Tidal Interaction CodeGalaxyis a program that calculates the gravitational effect of the close passage of twogalactic nuclei on a disk of stars. It is adapted from a program written by M. C. Schroederand Neil F. Comins and published inAstronomymagazine. This program is very similar tothe one used by Alar and Juri Toomre in 1972 to perform their ground-breaking studies ofthe effect of violent tides between galaxies.In the program there are two galactic nuclei of massesM1andM2. They are treated aspoint masses, and they move under the inÔ¨Çuence of their mutual gravitational attraction. Tospeed the calculations, onlyM1is surrounded by a disk of stars, with the stars initially incircular Keplerian orbits. The gravitational inÔ¨Çuence of the stars is neglected, meaning thatthey do not affect the motions of the nuclei or one another. There is no dynamical friction,andsothenucleifollowthesimpletwo-bodytrajectories.Oneadvantageofanon-self-gravitatingdiskisthatresultsdonotdependonthenumberofstarsinthedisk.Youcanexperiment,changingtheinitialconditionsbyusingjustafewstarsforafasterrunningtimeandthenincreasingthenumberofstarstoseemoredetail.Thestarsrespondonlytothegravitationalpullofthetwonuclei.The goal is to calculate the positions of the nuclei and stars through a number of timesteps separated by a time intervalŒ∑Delta1t. Let the positions of the nuclei at time stepibe[X1(i), Y1(i), Z1(i)]and[X2(i), Y2(i), Z2(i)],and let the position of a star be1[x(i), y(i), z(i)].Also, let the velocities of the nuclei and the star be[V1,x(i‚àí1/2), V1,y(i‚àí1/2), V1,z(i‚àí1/2)],[V2,x(i‚àí1/2), V2,y(i‚àí1/2), V2,z(i‚àí1/2)],and[vx(i‚àí1/2), vy(i‚àí1/2), vz(i‚àí1/2)].1The results do not change with the number of stars used, so one star is enough to illustrate the procedure.From Appendix M o f An Introduction to Modern AstrophysicSecond Edition, Bradley W.

The velocities are the average velocities between the present (i) and the previous (i‚àí1)time steps, sovx/parenleftbiggi‚àí12/parenrightbigg=x(i)‚àíx(i‚àí1)Œ∑Delta1t(1)is thexcomponent of the star‚Äôs velocity. In a similar manner, thexcomponent of the star‚Äôsacceleration isax(i)=vx(i+1/2)‚àívx(i‚àí1/2)Œ∑Delta1t.(2)Thus the positions and accelerations, which are determined at each time step, ‚Äúleapfrog‚Äùover the velocities, which are determined between time steps.Given these values of the positions and velocities, the program calculates thexcompo-nents of the positions and velocities for the next time step in the following way:1. Find the star‚Äôs acceleration at the present time stepi, using Newton‚Äôs law of gravity,ax(i)=GM1r31(i)[X1(i)‚àíx(i)]+GM2r32(i)[X2(i)‚àíx(i)],(3)wherer1(i)is the distance between the star andM1at time stepi,r1(i)=/radicalBig[X1(i)‚àíx(i)]2+[Y1(i)‚àíy(i)]2+[Z1(i)‚àíz(i)]2+s2f,(4)and similarly forr2(i).Note that because the nuclei and stars are treated as points, their separations couldbecome very small, even zero (although the conservation of angular momentummakes this rather unlikely). As a result, arbitrarily large values of 1/r31and 1/r32couldcause a numerical overÔ¨Çow and bring a lengthy calculation to an abrupt halt. To avoidthis numerical disaster, asoftening factor,sf, has been included in the calculationsof all separations. This is the smallest separation permitted by the program. Its valueis large enough to prevent an overÔ¨Çow, but small enough to have little effect on theoverall results.2.

Find the position of the nuclei at the next time stepi+1, usingX1(i+1)=X1(i)+V1,x/parenleftbiggi+12/parenrightbiggŒ∑Delta1t,(11)and similarly forX2(i+1).The procedure is the same for theyandzcomponents. By repeatedly applying this pre-scription, it is possible to follow the motions of the nuclei and star(s).The target galaxy (M1) is initially placed at rest at the origin. You will be asked toprovide the initial position and velocity of the intruder galaxy (M2), its mass (as a fractionofM1), and the number of stars around the target galaxy. After each time step, the resultsare displayed as two graphs showing the positions of the nuclei and stars on thex‚Äìyandx‚Äìzplanes.You will note in the source code that the program uses a special system of units to speedthe calculations. The masses are in units of 2√ó1010M‚äô. When the program assigns thetarget galaxy a mass of 5 in these units, its mass is 1011M‚äô. The unit of time is 1.2 millionyears. This is also the value used for the time interval,Œ∑Delta1t, so (in these units)Œ∑Delta1t=1. Asa result,Œ∑Delta1tdoes not appear explicitly in the program. (It would just multiply the terminvolved by 1 and waste computer time.) The unit of distance is 500 pc, and so the unitof velocity is(500 pc)/(1.2 million years)‚âÉ400 km s‚àí1. By design, in these units thegravitational constantG=1; thusGdoes not appear explicitly in the program either.The source code forGalaxy, along with executable versions, is available for downloadfrom the companion website athttp://www.aw-bc.com/astrophysics.Appendix: Galaxy, A Tidal Interaction Code
