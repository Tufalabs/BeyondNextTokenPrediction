Foreword
The latest text by Charles Brown, Elements of Spacecraft Design, complements
his other two texts, Spacecraft Mission Design and Spacecraft Propulsion, pre-
viously published in this series. This new text starts first with a comprehensive
discussion of the conceptual stages of mission design, systems engineering, and
orbital mechanics, all of which provide the basis for the design process for different
components and functions. Included are propulsion and power systems, structures,
attitude control, thermal control, command and data systems, and telecommuni-
cations. This text evolved from the spacecraft design course taught by the author
for many years at the University of Colorado.
The author is eminently qualified to write on the subject of spacecraft design,
having been involved in directing various design teams at Martin Marietta, for the
Mariner 9, the first spacecraft to orbit another planet in 1971, the Viking orbiter
spacecraft, and the Magellan spacecraft, which produced the first high-resolution
imaging of the planet Venus and was the first planetary spacecraft to fly on the
Shuttle. In 1992, Charles Brown received the Goddard Memorial Trophy for his
Magellan project leadership and the NASA Public Service Medal, just to mention
a few of his accomplishments and awards.
The AIAA Education Series of textbooks and monographs, inaugurated in 1984,
embraces a broad spectrum of theory and application of different disciplines in
aeronautics and astronautics, including aerospace design practice. The series also
includes texts on defense science, engineering, and management. The books serve
as both teaching texts for students and reference materials for practicing engineers,
scientists, and managers. The complete list of textbooks published in the series
can be found on the end pages of this volume.

Introduction
1.1 First Spacecraft
The first spacecraft was a publicity stunt. At the conclusion of World War II, the
United States and the USSR eyed each other across a destroyed Europe, neither
trusting the other, both holding the recipe for the atomic bomb. It was clear, from
captured German work, that it was feasible to design a ballistic missile capable
of delivering the bomb anywhere in the world. It was also clear that if the USSR
were first to have the capability, they could destroy the United States in a few
hours without any possibility of retaliation during the "missile gap" before we
finished our development. Both nations strained to develop the first intercontinental
missile capability, and the USSR was first to have it. They could not just call the
president and say "We've got it." They decided instead to make the announcement
in a very dramatic way. It turns out that if you can put a given-size bomb on
an intercontinental trajectory, you can put almost that much mass into low Earth
orbit.
The USSR announced their intercontinental missile capability to the world on 4
October 1957 by launching the world's first spacecraft, Sputnik I, into low Earth
orbit. The impact of Sputnik (Fig. 1.1), on public opinion was immense. The
airspace over the continental United States was never penetrated during World
War II despite the efforts of the two largest air forces ever assembled. Now Sputnik
cut through our airspace with impunity every 90 min.
It had been our national outlook that technical superiority counterbalanced the
huge human resources of the USSR. Suddenly and dramatically our technical
superiority was undermined. President Eisenhower spoke on television, then new,
to calm national fears. An outright race ensued between the two countries, which
came to be called the "space race." Clearly, the USSR won the first inning.
The spacecraft that changed world opinion was not impressive by today's stan-
dards. It was an 84-kg, 58-cm-diam ball that contained a battery, transmitter, and
whip antenna. The transmitter produced a monotonous beep that could be readily
received anywhere in the industrialized world. The beep continued incessantly
until the spacecraft reentered in January 1958.
After several embarrassing failures, the United States responded with the launch
of our first spacecraft, Explorer I, on 31 January 1958. The 14-kg Explorer I is
shown in Fig. 1.2; the lower half is actually a solid motor, which provided the
final velocity increment. The spacecraft is the upper half, which consisted of a
particles and fields experiment, micrometeorite experiment, cosmic ray detector,
and a low power transmitter. Explorer I was in orbit for two months during which
it discovered the Van Alien belt.
By the late 1960s the United States spacecraft launch capability had grown from
14 to 56,000 kg, and we had sent manned spacecraft to the moon.

Since Sputnik, there have been 4400 successful spacecraft launches (through
2000) by all nations.2'3 About 60% of these were launched by the USSR/CIS, about
half that many by the United States, and about 10% by the rest of the world (see
Fig. 1.3). Spacecraft launches have changed in recent years in three major ways:
1) The launch rate of the USSR/CIS has declined as economic problems in-
creased. In 1996 the launches by Russia fell below those of the United States for
the first time in 30 years.
2) In the early years spacecraft were all built and launched by governments.
In recent years U.S. commercial launches almost equal government launches.
Commercial launches, particularly Iridium and Globalstar, are also the cause of
the recent increases in the U.S. launch rate.
3) The national character of spacecraft launches has diminished. It is now com-
mon for a U.S. commercial spacecraft to be launched on a Russian launch vehicle
and contain equipment from many countries. In 1960 that would have been un-
heard of; a launch contained equipment of a single nation from launch bolts to
nose cone.
1.2 Spacecraft Missions
You might well ask, "What are all of these spacecraft doing?" They are doing
more things than anyone could possibly have imagined in 1957. These myriad
missions can be sorted into three primary classes: 1) Earth orbiters, 2) planetary and
lunar explorers, and 3) manned missions, as shown in Fig. 1.4. The first spacecraft to

leave the Earth's sphere of influence was Luna I in January 1959. It was intended for
the moon but missed its target by 37,600 miles. The first U.S. spacecraft to attempt
the same mission was Pioneer 4. Both spacecraft are still in orbit about the sun.
Since the advent of spacecraft in 1957, these odd devices have provided seven
classes of service to mankind that cannot be provided in any other way, at least
not well in any other way.
1.2.1 Communication
Few activities have provided the tremendous benefit that communication space-
craft have. As late as the 1960s, calls went overseas by cable. Six-hundred sixty
of them connected the United States with the rest of the world. Circuits were busy
and expensive. The phrase "like trying to call Paris" was a common expression for
any task that was time consuming, frustrating, and failure prone.
By 1998 we watched the Olympics in Japan brought to us by communication
spacecraft in near real time and thought nothing of it. Today we can go to an auto-
mated teller machine in rural Spain, withdraw from our home-town bank, and get
our money in local currency. The entire transaction takes place by communication
satellite in less time than it takes to tell about it. The phenomenal growth of satellite
communication is shown in Fig. 1.5.
Current advanced communications spacecraft designs are striving to provide
personal television, voice, and Internet services to any point on the face of the
Earth. In theory, a customer could sit in the middle of the Gobi Desert and watch
a baseball game on television, or phone a friend in New York, or conduct research
on the Internet. The global coverage is of particular interest to developing nations
because an enormous investment in Earth-based cabling would be avoided.

1.2.2 Weather
Early in the 19th century weather reports were gathered by mail. It was noted that
the great storms were rotary in nature and moved from place to place. Construction
of the first telegraph line in 1884 made it possible to gather reports on the weather
from many places simultaneously and also to track its changes and movement.
For the first time only a little over a century ago it was possible to make relatively
scientific weather forecasts, and some of the larger countries established storm-
warning services. The U.S. weather service was first established under the U.S.
Army Signal Corps in 1870 and became the U.S. Weather Bureau in 1891 (Ref. 5).
Meanwhile investigators had been sending weather instruments up on kites
and balloons to learn more about the upper atmosphere; these first atmospheric
"soundings" were made in the mid-18th century. However, there was little progress
in this direction until the 20th century, when the growth in aviation made it essential
to have information about winds, clouds, icing, and turbulence aloft. By 1938 daily
soundings were being made with radiosondes—balloons with weather instruments
and radio transmitters to return the data. Directional tracking capabilities were
added after 1940. These instruments, coupled with reports from ordinary weather
stations, from ships at sea, and from pilots of aircraft, provided the raw data for
meteorologists to use in making their science more exact. The rapid development
of electronic computers in the decades following 1940 made it possible for the
meteorologists to use all of these data without being inundated.
Today the NOAA spacecraft (Fig. 1.6) observe world-wide motion of weather
systems and provide these observations four times a day. Forecast weather based on
these observations are available at least twice per day and are available continuously
on the Internet. All nations can access the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), and for many NOAA is the only weather forecasting
reference. The instrument suite meets the data requirements of 140 nations.

1.2.3 Navigation
The use of heavenly bodies—i.e., the sun, the moon, stars, and planets—for
purposes of navigation was started centuries ago and was utilized extensively by
the early Portuguese navigators to explore this planet. These early explorers made
position fixes by combining the known positions of the heavenly bodies with
onboard position measurements made with an instrument called an astrolabe. The
results of this simple technique were sufficiently accurate to allow navigators to
find their approximate positions even when far from land. In the 18th century the
sextant, compass, and star and sun tables were integrated with the clock to improve
navigation performance significantly. By the 1940s the use of radio signal direction
finding led to Loran and Omega, which were much more accurate systems. In
general, navigators thus equipped were well satisfied to find a position within a
mile of the correct one.
Today a hand-held unit can use global positioning satellites to determine position
anywhere in the world with an accuracy of less than 30 m (Ref. 6). The hand-held
unit is available for less than $300.
1.2.4 Astronomy
The importance of spacecraft as a tool for astronomy was recognized immedi-
ately. Spacecraft avoid the optical distortion of the Earth's atmosphere and provide
unique positions from which to observe. The current series of astronomy spacecraft
are doing nothing less than revolutionizing our understanding of astronomy. The
current great observatories of the United States and the European Space Agency
(ESA) are as follows: 1) International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)7'8 launched in
1978; 2) Hubble Space Telescope (HST), at 11.6 tons, is the first of NASA's great
telescopes, launched in 1989; 3) Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), the
second of NASA's great observatories, was launched in April 1991; 4) Chandra
X-ray Observatory was launched 23 July 1999; 5) Hipparchus is an 1130-kg
astronomy spacecraft launched by ESA in August 1989; and 6) SOHO, solar
observatory mission, is a large, cooperative venture between ESA and NASA. A
single example of the many accomplishments of these machines is the HST photo-
graph of the three pillars of creation in the Eagle Nebula (Fig. 1.7), each pillar being
more than a light year (6 trillion miles) long. Gaseous globules at the tips of each

pillar, larger than our solar system, are embryonic stars. This photograph would
have been impossible to the point of absurdity, without the Hubble spacecraft.
7.2.5 Earth Resources
The first photo of the Earth taken from a satellite was made in 1959 by a camera
aboard the Mark II Reentry Vehicle, which was launched by an early Thor rocket.
The Gemini astronauts, using a hand-held Hasselblad camera, showed the potential
of the view from space.
Remote sensing is now an established technology. Every 18 days a LANDS AT
spacecraft crosses over every point on Earth, including your home. It can tell what
type of crops are growing, it they are healthy or diseased, and if they need water.
It can determine if ponds or lakes are clear, brackish, or salty. It makes these
determinations on a global basis to a resolution of one-quarter acre.9

1.2.6 Manned Spacecraft
Manned spacecraft are the most dramatic space machines; the bulk of the NASA
budget is spent on them and much has been written about them. Although manned
spacecraft are not the focus of this book, Table 1.1 commemorates some of the
major achievements in this field. In subsequent years these early achievements
were followed by the Space Shuttle, Mir, Soyuz, and the Space Station. Through
the end of 1996 there have been 192 manned flights of all nations, manned by a
total of 354 different astronauts.
1.2.7 Planetary Exploration
One of the most interesting things we can do with spacecraft is the explo-
ration of the solar system. Since 1957, spacecraft of the United States have

visited and gathered data from eight of the nine planets, with Pluto being the
only exception. The first 40 years of successful planetary spacecraft and their
missions are shown in Fig. 1.8. These missions provide photographic coverage,
atmospheric data, planetary weather, comparative geology, and an opportunity
to study the variation in the ways planets form and evolve. These spacecraft
have also provided an opportunity to search for life on other planets, so far un-
successful. The moons of Jupiter and Saturn have been studied and are equally
interesting.

Venus.

The digital data from Magellan were adjusted by computer to bring the ob-
servers' point of view down from orbital altitudes to a position at the foot of
the mountains. Without spacecraft our knowledge of Venus geology would have
been virtually nonexistent. (The author of this book was the Magellan spacecraft
program director.)
In our day it is impossible to imagine life without the benefits spacecraft bring.
But the purpose of this book is a different one: to show how rewarding it is to
design them.

System Engineering
System engineering is the comprehensive engineering task in spacecraft design.
It makes the subsystems work together and makes the whole greater than the
parts. System engineering includes the following major functions: 1) requirements
definition, 2) resource allocation and management, especially power and mass,
3) conduct of system level trade studies, for example comparing navigation by
ground operations and by onboard navigation, and 4) technical integration of the
subsystems into a spacecraft system and integration of the spacecraft with other
project elements: launch vehicle, ground systems, etc. In this chapter we will take
a top view of a spacecraft and a design project. We will discuss the anatomy of a
spacecraft, the resources and margins needed, and the launch vehicle interface. This
chapter will follow NASA practice and terminology1; however, all government
agencies have similar practices.
2.1 Anatomy of a Spacecraft
In this section we will discuss the life cycle of a spacecraft project, the compo-
sition of a spacecraft project, and the subsystems of which a spacecraft is made.
2.1.1 Spacecraft Life Cycle
A spacecraft is born by stages, as shown in Fig. 2.1. The design activities on a
spacecraft vary substantially during the life cycle. The first step is an idea: "I won-
der if we couldn't get surface pictures of Venus through the clouds using synthetic
aperture techniques?". An idea can originate anywhere in the aerospace commu-
nity, from a customer, from a university, or from a contractor. Most corporations
and customers maintain small organizations with the purpose of generating and
studying mission ideas.
The second step is a feasibility check. There was a time when this step meant
a feasibility study to make sure the idea could be implemented. Feasibility is not
much of a step these days; almost everything is feasible: a phone call or two will
likely clear up the feasibility. "Yes, we could get SAR (synthetic aperture radar)
images from an altitude of 1000 km with a resolution of about 100 m." After
feasibility checks it is time to find out if the customer needs the mission bad
enough to justify it. In a planetary or scientific mission, a selected, high level,
science group will answer this question. If the answer is favorable it is time to do
concept trades; this is called phase A.
2.1.1.1 Phase A: Preliminary analysis. Preliminary studies are usually
done by a number of companies in industry with customer oversight, a cus-
tomer mission statement, and some customer money. The studies are awarded

competitively. There are usually customer studies as well. The primary questions
that are answered during phase A are the following:
1) What is a reasonable spacecraft configuration that will do the mission? (Not
the best; one that will work reasonably well.)
2) Are there any "tall poles" (significant cost, schedule or technical risks) in the
development?
3) What major trade studies should be made?
4) About what is it going to cost?
5) About how long will it take?
A phase A design is a conceptual design, professionally done, that will meet the
mission statement, has no technical flaws, and is internally consistent. It is not yet
necessary to find the best design; that happens in phase B.
2.1.1.2 Phase B: Definition. Phase B studies are usually awarded competi-
tively to at least two contractors; they are not necessarily the phase A contractors.
The questions to be answered by the winning phase B bidders are the following:
1) What is the best spacecraft design for the mission? (and why?)
2) What are the risks involved?
3) What is your implementation plan?
4) What is your company's cost estimate?
5) How much time would it take your company?
6) Are any long-lead actions necessary to protect schedule?
During this phase the technical and business baselines for the project are defined.
2.1.1.3 Phase C/D: Full-scale development. After phase B studies are
completed, a winner-take-all competition is conducted. The winner is awarded a
full-scale development contract. Theoretically the winning design is implemented;
however, that almost never happens. The competitive phases take time (five years in
the case of Magellan). During that time, changes have probably occurred in the cus-
tomer's mission statement and certainly have occurred in his funding plans. Thus,
in the real world, the winning contractor normally conducts a short, delta-phase-B
study on revised design requirements; this step took a year in the Magellan case.
A full-scale development program progresses through recognized phases of its
own. In the preliminary design phase, requirements and performance are defined
to the point that detailed design drawings can be made. In preliminary design, the
engineering emphasis is on 1) functional performance, 2) requirements definition,
and 3) interface definition.
The phase ends with the preliminary design review (PDR). The PDR is a formal
customer review to evaluate the adequacy of the preliminary design and compliance
with the customer requirements. After PDR the design is partially frozen and
specifications are put under change control.
In the design phase the build drawings are made and the software is coded.
Subcontracts are started for components (reaction wheels, computers, valves and
the like) or subsystems that are buy items. (In real life, it is often necessary to
start some subcontracts prior to PDR.) Subsystem-level build and test is started in
this phase. The design phase ends with the critical design review (CDR), which is a
formal customer review that evaluates the adequacy of the design and the interface
definitions.

2.1.1.4 Assembly, test, and launch operations (ATLO). ATLO starts
when flight-qualified subassemblies are available for assembly into a flight space-
craft. Usually spacecraft assembly starts with units identical to the qualification
units that are qualified in parallel with spacecraft assembly. Even if there are qual-
ification failures, time is saved. The system level tests include the following:
1) System level functional tests of each mission phase. These are repeated
between environmental tests.
2) Thermal testing simulating space, either solar thermal vacuum (technically
best) or infrared vacuum (cheapest).
3) Acoustics, simulating the environment in the launch vehicle shroud.
4) End-to-end communications check using a ground station, for example the
deep space network station at Kennedy Space Center.
5) Mission simulations and environmental tests (acoustics, thermal vacuum).
This phase ends with the pre-ship review which considers the acceptability of the
spacecraft in the light of system test data.
2.1.1.5 Launch phase. This phase normally includes reassembly after
shipment to the launch site and retesting. Just prior to launch there is one final
review to asses the readiness of the spacecraft.
2.1.1.6 Phase E: Mission operations. Phase E starts immediately after
launch. The mission operations team is typically trained for some months during
assembly and test, to control and command the spacecraft remotely and to be
proficient at understanding the spacecraft condition from a flight-like data stream.
The mission operations (MOS) team can be as large as several hundred people or
as small as a several people, depending on the complexity of the spacecraft and of
the mission.
2.1.1.7 Reviews. The most common formal customer reviews that are con-
ducted in the course of a program are listed in Table 2.1. These reviews have evolved
over the last four decades and follow released guidelines that are essentially the
same for all government agencies.
It is normal practice to conduct subsystem PDRs and CDRs in the same general
time frame as the spacecraft PDR and CDR. These reviews are also used in industry
to denote a rough measure of program maturity: for example, "The program just
completed PDR."

2.1.1.8 Commercial procurement. The phases, reviews, and steps just
described are for a government procurement. A commercial procurement can vary
considerably because of the following factors:
1) Design is driven by financial concerns (return on investment, market share).
2) The approval chain extends to the board of directors.
3) There is usually a single customer engineering point of contact.
4) There is usually no set of established procedures for guidance.
5) Once the contract is signed there is minimal customer oversight.
6) There is legal and regulatory impact on the design, especially in communi-
cation spacecraft.
2.1.2 Project Elements
If you observe the myriad activities on a spacecraft project you will discover
that they can be divided into five reasonably self-contained project elements, as
shown in Fig. 2.2.
2.1.2.1 Science pay load. The science payload is the set of instruments
that perform the mission. On Magellan the science payload was a single instru-
ment, the synthetic aperture radar. Magellan was unusual in that it had only one
instrument; the Cassini spacecraft will explore Saturn and its moons with 12 differ-
ent instruments on the Orbiter and six more on the Probe. The instrument payload
usually comes from a different organization than the spacecraft, often a university
or the customer. The primary payload interfaces with the spacecraft are power, data
management, command, thermal, mechanical, and field of view. The instruments
sometimes come with a built-in data collection and formatting capability.
2.1.2.2 Launch system. The vehicle and support elements that put the
spacecraft in orbit about Earth or on an escape trajectory to a planet comprise
the launch system. Sometimes the spacecraft supplies some of this energy (e.g.,
Voyager), but the major energy source is the launch vehicle. The launch vehicle is

a primary interface; the design loads for the structure are from the launch vehicle.
The launch vehicle shroud determines the maximum spacecraft dimensions during
launch. This constraint results in a collection of mechanisms that change the space-
craft from launch configuration to mission configuration. There is also a strong
launch vehicle functional interface with power, command, telecommunication, and
command and data systems.
For Space Shuttle launches there is an astronaut safety interface requiring sig-
nificant spacecraft resources and approximately three years of coordination culmi-
nating in full-scale spacecraft/shuttle emergency exercises. In addition, there are
two countdowns to prepare for. The first countdown is to the launch of the shuttle,
with the added constraint of good weather at all shuttle emergency landing sites.
The second countdown is with shuttle in orbit. For a planetary mission there is
a point in space on each orbit from which the mission can be initiated. A count-
down is required culminating in separation from shuttle at that point. If there is a
spacecraft failure in this on-orbit countdown and the spacecraft is too heavy for a
shuttle landing, the spacecraft will be jettisoned as space junk.
Detailed engineering integration with the launch vehicle is an involved process
and should start about 36 months before launch, up to 48 months for a shuttle
launch. The structural loads analysis and integration requires a special emphasis
and a series of formal meetings.
There are now more launch systems to choose from than ever before. The premier
source of launch vehicle information is the International Reference Guide to Space
Launch Systems, by Isakowitz et al.2
2.1.2.3 Tracking and data systems. After liftoff, the link to a spacecraft is
through tracking and data stations that 1) receive the spacecraft downlink and relay
it to mission operations and 2) uplink commands to the spacecraft. These stations
also use the radio link to provide the range, azimuth, and elevation to the spacecraft.
These systems are discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, "Telecommunication."
2.1.2.4 Mission operations (MOS). At liftoff a hand-off from the launch
team to the MOS team is made as the vehicle leaves the launch pad. In the case
of a planetary launch, the launch team is at Cape Canaveral and the MOS team is
typically located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.
The MOS team provides analysis of spacecraft performance from the downlink
and provides spacecraft commands for uplink. The downlink data are decoded and
delivered to the consoles of the MOS team. Normal performance parameters are
stored in a database. Any anomalous behavior is dealt with by the team. This may
be a minor issue or a spacecraft life-threatening event. (To paraphrase an old pilot
saying, MOS can be hours and hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer
terror.)
The MOS team also prepares and tests the commands that are uplinked to
the spacecraft. A command error can, and has, caused total spacecraft failure,
so commands are heavily reviewed and tested. (Work on the Magellan Venus
orbit insertion commands started eight months before encounter.) It is helpful
for the MOS team to have a spacecraft simulator on which to test commands.
These simulators are very expensive and vary widely in definition from program
to program.

Planetary MOS work is complicated by the time delay resulting from planetary
distance. For Mars and Venus the data stream is telling you what went on 15-30 min
ago. For a Jupiter mission the delay is about 1 h. So if data from Jupiter show a
failure and it takes 1 h to decide what to do, prepare and test the commands, it will
be 3 h after the failure when a command reaches the spacecraft. Modern planetary
spacecraft have an onboard fault protection system because of this delay. In many
fault protection system designs, failures too difficult for the fault protection system
to solve cause the vehicle to go into a safe mode and call for help from MOS. There
is a major trade-off here between how much the spacecraft can do for itself and
how much MOS support to provide.
2.1.3 Spacecraft Subsystems
The spacecraft is traditionally subdivided into eight subsystems as shown in
Fig. 2.2 and Table 2.2. These subsystems align with the general academic special-
ties of an engineering staff and provide reasonably manageable interfaces among
subsystems. The spacecraft subsystems will be covered briefly in this section and
in more depth in the remainder of the book, the pertinent chapter is shown in the
right column of Table 2.2.
The ACS and the CDS subsystems are heavy users of onboard computer re-
source. The two subsystems may share a single flight computer or, more often,
two separate computers custom designed to the tasks. The flight and ground soft-
ware is sometimes organized as a separate spacecraft subsystem; in this book
software and computers are discussed with the CDS in Chapter 8.
2.1.4 Functional Block Diagram
The functional block diagram is a useful, concise way to visualize the relation-
ships between the subsystems. A highly simplified example is shown in Fig. 2.3.
These diagrams are prepared and maintained by the system engineering team; in
some cases their distribution may be a customer requirement.
2.2 Mass Properties
There are three types of spacecraft mass properties that must be controlled:
1) spacecraft moments of inertia, 2) spacecraft mass, and 3) center of mass. Each
of these must be calculated, controlled, and kept current for each of the spacecraft
mission modes (launch mode, cruise mode, mission mode, etc.). For a spinning
spacecraft the ratios of axial moments of inertia are also critical; a flat spin can
result if the ratio favors the wrong axis. Center of mass is important for determining
the torque resulting from motor firings and for thrust vector control during motor
firings.
Although there are several mass property functions, spacecraft weight is always
the major noisy issue on a spacecraft project. Experience shows that spacecraft
mass always increases as understanding of the design increases. Very early in the
process, systems engineering should provide mass and power reserves and allocate
the remainder to each of the subsystems. Current best estimate (CBE) of power
and mass compared with the allocations provides a running measure of how the
design team is doing.

2.2.1 Mass Definitions
The following mass definitions are generally used; however, there is no standard,
and detailed definitions vary. Figure 2.4 illustrates the definitions and shows actual
mass breakdown of the Viking Orbiter in kilograms.
Science (or pay load) mass is the mass of the science instruments plus all equip-
ment used in direct support of the instruments. The support equipment usually
includes mounting structure, power cabling, engineering instrumentation, thermal
control heaters, blankets, and radiators. It may also include a dedicated data sys-
tem. It is the U.S. Air Force custom to call this equipment the payload. (This use
of payload is not to be confused with payload as used by launch vehicle teams. In
the launch vehicle world, payload means the spacecraft launch mass.)

22 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
Bus or platform mass is the total, on-orbit, dry mass of the spacecraft subsys-
tems, structure, propulsion, thermal control, power, attitude control, telecommu-
nication, and data systems. The masses of the science, propellants, and gasses are
not included. Dry mass means mass without propellant or gasses loaded.
Launch vehicle adapter (LVA) mass is the mass of the structure, separation
devices, cabling, and thermal control equipment necessary to adapt the spacecraft
to the launch vehicle. (The launch vehicle adapter is provided by the spacecraft
team, but it is left with the launch vehicle at staging.)
Injected mass is the mass of a planetary spacecraft that is accelerated to the
Earth departure velocity. Normally this is the cruise mass plus the launch vehicle
adapter plus the burn-out mass of the last stage.
Launch mass is the total mass of the spacecraft as it rests on the launch vehicle
in launch configuration. It includes propellants, gases, and the launch vehicle
adapter.
Cruise mass is the wet or dry mass in interplanetary cruise configuration. It is the
launch mass minus the launch vehicle adapter mass. (All spacecraft with multiple
configurations have a mass statement for each).
On-orbit dry mass consists of two major parts, the mass of the science instru-
ments plus the platform or bus mass. Propellant and gas masses are not included
(hence dry mass). When spacecraft mass is specified, discussed, and controlled it
is at this level.
Burn-out mass is the mass of the spacecraft just after shut-down from any
particular propulsion event. It is the spacecraft dry mass plus the pressurizing gas
plus propellant remaining.
Mass uncertainty is an estimate of the growth in mass from a given time to the
launch day. Uncertainty is calculated by various algorithms based on the maturity
of the mass estimate.
Mass maturity is reflected by the commonly used degrees of maturity, which are
estimated, calculated, and actual. Actual mass is a weight measurement of actual
flight hardware. Calculated mass is an engineering calculation of mass based on
the dimensions on the flight equipment drawings. Estimated mass is an estimate
based on history or analogous units.
Mass margin or contingency is the difference between the current spacecraft
launch mass estimate and the launch vehicle capability.
2.2.2 Preliminary Estimates
This section contains weight-estimating relationships that can be used for very
early estimates of on-orbit dry mass. These relationships are based on statistics
from prior spacecraft. Note that estimating relationships based on history, by def-
inition, do not reflect the latest state of the art. Figure 2.5 shows the on-orbit dry
mass of seven geosynchronous communication satellites as a function of payload
mass. In Fig. 2.5, the on-orbit dry mass can be estimated to be about 3.6 times
the payload mass. Recall that the on-orbit dry weight contains the payload weight;
therefore, the data in Fig. 2.5 also show that the supporting subsystems will weigh
about 2.6 times the weight of the payload supported.
A JPL study3 of 46 Earth-orbiting navigation, communications, meteorology,
Earth resources, and astronomy spacecraft, showed that the on-orbit dry mass was

bounded by the limits of 3 and 7 times the pay load mass with the average ratio
being 4.8; see Fig. 2.6.
Figure 2.7 shows planetary spacecraft on-orbit dry mass vs payload mass for
11 planetary spacecraft including Magellan, Mars Orbiter, Mars Global Surveyor,
Galileo, Voyager, and four Mariners. From these historical data, the on-orbit dry
mass of planetary spacecraft can be estimated as about 7.5 times payload mass.
It should be emphasized that spacecraft level estimates of this type are for pre-
liminary work only. Such estimates should be replaced by more detailed subsystem
level (bottoms up) estimates as soon as possible in a study.
2.2.3 Mass Growth
Spacecraft mass always increases, and it grows more than you think it will.
Magellan mass history shows that even after flight equipment was weighed the
growth was still 1.2% because of thermal paint, lockwire, QC putty, brackets,
pigtails, attach nuts, etc.
The spacecraft on-orbit dry mass growth from program start to launch is sum-
marized in Table 2.3 for seven spacecraft programs. Table 2.3 shows that a margin
of 27% between the estimated spacecraft mass and the launch vehicle capabil-
ity has a 50/50 chance of being adequate. Five of these seven spacecraft were

designed under intense pressure from the launch vehicle mass constraint. In-
adequate mass margin causes programs to be more expensive than they would
be otherwise. To further appreciate the mass growth shown in Table 2.3, you
must realize that the ATP weights were results of substantial preliminary design
study. Magellan was in preliminary design for five years prior to ATP. The Mag-
ellan ATP mass also contained actual weights for a substantial amount of equip-
ment. As a design matures the mass will grow; it is essential to have adequate
margin.
The U.S. Air Force conducted a study of the mass growth of 11 spacecraft
programs. The mass growth of spacecraft subsystems is shown in Table 2.4. The
command and data subsystem shows the most erratic mass history. This may
have been caused by the rapid improvement in computer state of the art. All
subsystems reflect the growth trend exhibited by the spacecraft as a whole. The
study showed an unusual number of subsystems with mass losses (mass losses are
usually accounting changes or configuration changes).
Mass histories are plentiful; it can be shown that mass increases regardless of
carefully preliminary work. Why does this happen?
First, improved understanding. For example, you may have made an initial
estimate of the launch vehicle adapter using historical data similar to Eq. (2.1).

After the first stress analysis the weight might increase substantially. After final
loads data are available, it would increase again. When the build drawings are
released it would increase again. When the actual truss was weighed it would
increase again. When the thermal coatings were put on the truss, the actual weight
would increase.
The electrical cables are notorious for this type of weight increase. In prelimi-
nary design the cable weights will be estimated by a historical relation similar to
Eq. (2.1). Accurate cable weight estimates cannot be made until detailed drawings
of the spacecraft structure, electrical equipment installation drawings, and detailed
knowledge of each connector are available. Even armed with this much detail, it
requires an elaborate CAD/CAM type of analysis to produce a reasonable cable
weight estimate. For this reason, cable weights are suspect until actual weights
are available; these will be higher than estimates (sometimes substantially higher).
Several spacecraft have gotten in serious weight trouble because of this problem
alone.
Second, make-play changes. Changes of this type are myriad as the equipment
is tested. An easy example is a structural test failure. Almost by definition, the
corrective action for these failures adds weight. Another example is a supplier
going out of business. The substitute equipment is, of course, heavier. Almost
all adversity encountered during the definition of the design requires weight to
solve.
Third, improvement changes. As the design progresses, better ideas will occur.
These ideas are often cost issues but they can have weight impact as well.
Of these three causes of weight increase, only the improvement changes can be
managed. Make-play changes and improved understanding cannot be avoided. As
a result, weight will increase with design maturity. The best defense is intelligent
provision of weight margin.

2.2.4 AIAA Recommended Mass Margin
Mass contingency, or margin, is the allowance for growth resulting from design
definition and development. Mass margin is defined as
Margin = Total capability — Current best estimate
%Margin =capabilityx 100(2.1)
(2.2)
A committee of the AIAA, in cooperation with the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), has reviewed industry-wide historical data from numerous DOD
and NASA manned and unmanned programs. Using these data, ANSI and AIAA
recommended the dry mass contingencies shown in Table 2.5 as a function of
design maturity.
Design maturity is measured in Table 2.5 by the major reviews conducted during
a design: the bid (proposal or bid stage), PRR, FRR, CoDR, PDR, and CDR (see
Table 2.1). The classes of design listed in Table 2.5 are class 1: a new spacecraft
(one of a kind, first generation); class 2: the next-generation spacecraft based on a
previously developed family, which expands in complexity or capability within an
established design envelope; and class 3: a production-level development based
on an existing design for which multiple units are planned and where a significant
amount of standardization exists.

2.2.5 Allocating Subsystem Dry Mass
One of the first actions in initiating a spacecraft design is the allocation of
available mass to the subsystems. The steps in the process are as follows:
1) Determine the maximum spacecraft launch mass for the mission.
2) Deduct launch vehicle adapter mass from launch mass.
3) Determine the propellants and pressurants required for the mission.
4) Determine the total allowable on-orbit dry mass.
5) Establish the total allowable pay load weight (usually specified by the cus-
tomer).
6) Evaluate the mass margin to be set aside. The AIAA guidelines11 are very
useful in this step.
7) Allocate mass budgets to each subsystem.
The less obvious of these steps are discussed in the following sections.
2.2.5.1 Maximum spacecraft launch mass. The maximum spacecraft
launch mass is derived directly from the launch vehicle capability, which in turn
is a function of the mission design. This key requirement is usually specified by
the customer, although data are readily available from Isakowitz's International
Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems1 or from individual manufacturers.
2.2.5.2 Launch vehicle adapter. This assembly adapts the launch vehicle
structure to the spacecraft structure and provides for spacecraft separation. It is
designed by the spacecraft team but is left with the launch vehicle at separation. The
mass of the adapter comes out of the spacecraft mass budget. As you would expect,
the adapter mass is a strong function of the spacecraft mass, as shown in Fig. 2.8.
The equation in Fig. 2.8 can be rounded to
LVA = 0.0755LM + 50 (2.3)

LVA — launch vehicle adapter mass, kg

aComsat — communication satellite. bMetsat = meteorology or weather satellite. °P/L = payload.
2.2.5.3 Propellant and pressurant mass. If the spacecraft will perform
translational velocity change maneuvers, such as orbit insertion, the propellant
load may be substantial and can be estimated using the Tsiolkowski equations
discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.
2.2.5.4 Total allowable subsystem on-orbit dry mass. This mass can be
computed as follows:
Total allowable dry weight for the spacecraft subsystems = LM — LVA
— Margin — Payload mass — Propellant mass — Pressurant mass
The preceding equation assumes that the payload is customer furnished and not
part of the spacecraft development task (the most common case). If the payload is
being developed along with the other spacecraft subsystems, it should be treated
as another subsystem and not be deducted from the equation.
2.2.5.5 Allocating subsystem mass budgets. The final step is the intel-
ligent division of the total allowable dry weight into subsystem allocations. For
this process the best guide is history. Table 2.6 provides a subsystem mass al-
location guide for initial mass budgets. This table was developed by analysis of
several spacecraft of each type. Two conditions are shown: 1) payload supplied by
the spacecraft team and 2) customer-supplied payload (or government-furnished
equipment, GFE).
In Table 2.6, for communication satellites, telecommunication is not shown
separately; it is included in the CDS mass. The subsystem weights are shown as
percentages of spacecraft dry weight.

SYSTEM ENGINEERING 29
Launch weight capability = 1868 kg
Payload weight (supplied by customer = 222 kg
Orbit insertion Delta V propellant required = 1027kg
Launch vehicle adapter mass:
LVA = 0.076 (1868) + 50 = 192kg
Propellants required: Calculation of required propellant is discussed in
Chapter 4. For now, assume that the propellant required is 1027 kg.
On-orbit dry mass: Spacecraft maximum on-orbit dry mass is equal to
LM capability - Adapter - Propellant = 1868 - 192 - 1027
= 649kg (143lib)
Allowable subsystem mass: The maximum allowable subsystem or bus mass is
equal to
On-orbit dry mass - Payload mass = 649 - 222 = 427 kg
Mass margin: Taken from Table 2.5, Category CW, bid stage, class 1 = 30%.
The total subsystem mass for allocation = 427/1.30 = 328 kg; mass margin =
427 - 328 = 99 kg. (It is a common error to calculate margin as a percentage of
maximum allowable (427 x 0.30); however, the approach shown is preferred.)
Allocation: 328 kg may now be allocated to subsystems using the percentages
given in Table 2.6. The result is shown in Table 2.7.
2.2.5.6 Launch mass prediction algorithm. Once the design process starts,
the mass properties activity changes from budget allocation to monitoring progress
and estimating what the actual launch weight will be. For mass monitoring, it is
customary to tabulate detailed weights along with the maturity of each element.

The classes of maturity are estimated, calculated, and actual. For example, the
launch vehicle adapter weight initially is estimated using an estimating relation-
ship similar to Fig. 2.8. The adapter mass is entered into the project weight tables
as an estimated weight. After the adapter structure is designed, the adapter weight
is calculated from the drawing dimensions and material densities. This weight is
entered into the project weight tables as calculated. Finally, after the adapter is
built, it is weighed and the weight entered as actual.
Periodically, usually monthly, the total set of weight tables is summarized to
produce 1) the current spacecraft weight estimate, 2) an estimate of the weight at
launch, 3) the percentage of the total weight in each maturity category, and 4) a
report card on the weight status of each subsystem. Item 2, the estimate of launch
weight, is the difficult issue. Analysis of spacecraft history suggests the launch
weight prediction algorithm shown in Table 2.8. The weight growth remaining
to launch is estimated by multiplying the current best estimate by the factors
shown in Table 2.8. These factors are a function of the maturity of the weight
item (estimated, calculated, or actual), and also a function of the equipment type,
structure, propulsion, electronics, or cabling.
To arrive at a projected launch weight, the sum of all structure mass in the
estimated category should be increased by 25%, the sum of all structure mass in
the calculated category increased by 4.6%, and the actual category increased by
2.6%. The sum of these adjusted masses is the predicted launch mass for structure.
The process is repeated for propulsion mass, electronics mass, and cabling mass
to produce the projected launch mass of the spacecraft:
Structure LM = 1.25(Est Stru) + 1.046(Calc Stru) + 1.026(Actual Stru)
Propulsion LM = 1.05(Est Prop) + 1.046(Calc Prop) + 1.026(Actual Prop)
Electronics LM = 1.15(Est Elect) + 1.032(Calc Elect) + 1.012(Actual Elect)
Cabling LM = 1.50(Est Cable) + 1.05(Calc Cable) + 1.012(Actual Cable)
The projected dry launch mass is the sum of structure, propulsion, electronics,
and cable estimates just shown. Figure 2.9 is a report card on the algorithm using
Magellan weights. It shows a comparison of the projection of the algorithm, as a
function of time, with the actual launch mass. The algorithm served the program
well. Its worst projection was 4% (40 kg) high.
2.2.6 Moments of Inertia
Spacecraft moments of inertia are important for two reasons: 1) The propellant
required to maintain stability or to make rotational maneuvers is proportional to

moment of inertia. 2) The spin axis of a spinning spacecraft must be the axis of
highest moment of inertia or the spacecraft is unstable. The moments of inertia
must be actively controlled to maintain spin stability.
The moment of inertia about any axis is the sum of the elemental masses times
the distances from the axis; see Fig. 2.10:
L = Emrz (2.4)
where r is the distance from the center of mass of element m to the axis x. One
of the bookkeeping chores of a project is to record m and r for each part or box
to be installed on the spacecraft. In the preliminary design phases of a project,
the moments of inertia are estimated from the larger elements of the spacecraft
(for example the equipment module). In the later phases, the moments will be
calculated at the box level (for example a battery).
The moments of inertia of some useful shell shapes are summarized in Fig. 2.11.
In the figure, moment of inertia is represented by /, surface area by S, radius by
R, and mass by W. Uniform density is assumed. Figure 2.11 is only a sample of
the data available for shells and solids, see AIAA Aerospace Design Engineer's

2.3 Power
Power is the second critical resource, along with mass, in the design of a space-
craft. In this section the process of estimating, allocating, and controlling this
expendable resource will be described.
2.3.1 Estimating Total Power Requirement
A spacecraft design starts with a working definition (not necessarily a final
definition) of the pay load requirements. There is usually little or no knowledge of
the spacecraft power requirement at the start. However, total spacecraft power is a
strong function of the payload power; initial power requirements can be estimated
on this basis. Table 2.9 summarizes estimating relationships of this kind based on
a statistical analysis of past spacecraft designs.
As a spacecraft design progresses, the early power estimates made with the rela-
tions in Table 2.9 will be replaced with better estimates. Additional information on
the formulation of the table can be found in Chapter 6, "Power." Note that the total
spacecraft power computed from the relations in the table includes payload power
but no contingency. Contingency should be added to the total power calculated
from the relations.
In setting the payload power for use in a Table 2.9 estimate, it is necessary to
be careful of the heaters used in the payload instruments. There are two common
types of payload heaters: replacement heaters and bake-out heaters.
Replacement heaters are used for thermal control reasons. When the equipment
is turned off, a replacement heater is turned on. The power level of the replacement
heater may be the same as that of the equipment it replaces or, more often, slightly
lower. High enough for thermal protection but as low as possible to relieve the
power load. In building the payload power requirement for such equipment, you
clearly do not want to add the replacement heater power to the equipment maximum
power.
Bake-out heaters are used with optical instruments to bake out the volatiles in
the elastomers, coatings, insulations, and other organics used in the construction of
the instrument. This vacuum bake-out is to make certain the volatiles do not later
condense on the lenses. The bake-out is done early in the flight and can take many
days. It is done in early cruise so that the instrument is ready for use when the
mission starts. Bake-out is free to the power system because it occurs when
the solar panels are new. When you design the panels in Chapter 6, you will note
that degradation is significant with time. Beginning-of-life (BOL) power is sub-
stantially greater than end-of-life (EOL) power. (EOL power is the design point).

On planetary missions, early cruise takes place in full sun, no battery charging is
required, and the payload is turned off. Power is so plentiful in early cruise that
the design problem is to make sure the shunt radiators are big enough to dump the
excess. Clearly, bake-out heaters should not be included in establishing the power
requirement or in estimating total spacecraft power.
2.3.2 Power Allocation
Table 2.10 is a guide for the initial allocation of power for each subsystem; the
recommendation is expressed as a percentage of total power available to subsystem
loads after deducting margin and power specified for the payload. Table 2.10 was
developed by statistical analysis of several spacecraft of each type.
In Table 2.10, cable losses are included in the power system allotment. For
communication satellites the engineering communication is included in the com-
mand and data subsystem (CDS); there is no engineering communication system
separate from the payload. In the communication satellite industry the command
and data system is generally called the telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C)
subsystem.
2.3.3 Power Margin
Power margin or contingency is defined as
Margin = Total capability — Current best estimate (2.5)
%Margin = ——Margm__ x 100 (2.6)Total capability
Total capability is the total power capability of the power system, the maximum
output of the power source. In a solar powered planetary mission, the total capa-
bility at Earth and at the target planet will be different because of the difference
in solar distance. In any solar panel powered mission, total capability decreases
with age of the panel. In radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) powered
missions the total capability decreases with time as the isotope decays.
AIAA conducted a review of historical data from prior NASA and DOD pro-
grams to establish industrial guidelines for the power margin shown in
Table 2.11. Design maturity is expressed in Table 2.11 as a function of the major

reviews conducted during a design: the bid, CoDR, PDR, CDR, PRR, and FRR (see
Table 2.1).
The classes of design listed in Table 2.11 are class 1: a new spacecraft (one of a
kind, first generation); class 2: the next-generation spacecraft based on a previously
developed family, which expands in complexity or capability within an established
design envelope; and class 3: a production-level development based on an existing
design for which multiple units are planned and where a significant amount of
standardization exists. Note that there should be at least a 10% power margin at
liftoff to ensure adequate power for changes in the power profile during the flight
mission.
Example 2.2 Power Allocation
Estimate spacecraft power consumption for a communications spacecraft with
a payload power requirement of 1500 W (from Table 2.9):
Pt = 1.1568 (1500) + 55.497 = 1791 W
The subsystem power allocation is 1791 - 1500 = 291 W.
Apply AIAA recommended contingency for proposal stage, class 1, new design.
From Table 2.11, the recommended contingency is 70%. Assuming that contin-
gency for the payload is held by the payload provider, a (291)(0.70) = 204 W
contingency should be provided for the subsystem design. The total spacecraft
power allocation is shown in Table 2.12.
Power now can be allocated to the subsystems using the percentages in
Table 2.13. Note that power contingency is handled differently than mass con-
tingency. The purpose of power margin is to make certain that the initial estimate

of solar panel size is adequate. The solar panels are normally long-lead items. If
the panel size is initially underestimated and later needs to be increased, a seri-
ous panel delivery schedule problem will likely result. It may become necessary to
comb back through the design, decreasing the power requirement. Either approach
will result in substantial unplanned cost.
2.4 Other Margins
Mass margins and power margins are normally the most troublesome and were
covered in earlier sections. Other design margins are also required; guidelines for
these are discussed in this section and exhaustively covered in Design, Verification
and Operations Principles for Flight Systems, from JPL.13
2.4.1 Propulsion
The required propellant load should be based on the maximum possible space-
craft mass, including unallocated reserves (the launch vehicle limit), minimum
engine specific impulse, and maximum possible mission AV requirement. For a
liquid propellant system, propellant margin above requirements should be pro-
vided if at all possible. The more margin you can place here, the better the chances
for an extended mission or desirable, unplanned maneuvers. Propellant margin can
be reduced late in the program if necessary.
Propellant temperatures, and hardware in contact with propellant, should be
maintained >10°C above propellant freezing temperature.
Propellant upper temperature must be controlled with substantial margin. Se-
rious failures have occurred by overheating propellant. Note that most elevated

temperature data on propellants are obtained in laboratory conditions (sterile quartz
glass containers and the like); real conditions aboard a spacecraft can lead to pro-
pellant decomposition at temperatures lower than laboratory data.
2.4.2 Computer Resource
JPL recommends13 the following for all computer resource parameters, includ-
ing memory, CPU speed, and throughput:
At computer selection 400%
At start of phase C/D 60%
At launch 20%(to accommodate post-launch fixes, new
sequences, and adequate operating margin)
Margin percentage is computed as shown in Eq. (2.2).
2.4.3 Processing Time and Data Bus Usage
The computer processing maximum throughput requirement should not exceed
50% of computer capacity at the time of computer selection.
2.4.4 Thermal Margin
The thermal margin should be kept at the component level. The calculated
temperatures for components need to be kept well inside the component design,
qualification, and flight acceptance limits. Figure 2.12 shows the recommended
thermal margin pyramid. Note that the temperature calculations are for the stacked
worst case. What Fig. 2.12 shows is that a component which the thermal analysis
predicts would see 85°C in the hot case and 20°C in the cold case would be qualified
at the following temperatures.

85 + 10+10+15 = 120°C

Fig. 2.13 Bathtub curve.
2.4.5 Battery Margin
The recommended13 battery energy margin is 40%, minimum, at phase C/D
start.
2.4.6 Force/Torque Margin
Mission-critical deployments and separations, e.g., solar panel deployment,
antenna deployment, and launch vehicle separation require a force/torque mar-
gin of at least 100% under worst-case conditions including cold, stiff cables, and
vacuum coefficients of friction.
2.4.7 Electronics Minimum Operating Time
The flight spacecraft electronic systems should have about 1000 h of operat-
ing time, at system level prior to launch. This requirement is based on the long-held
belief that electronic failures as a function of time follow a bathtub curve
(Fig. 2.13), with infant mortality failures occurring in the first 1000 or so hours
and wear-out failures occurring after many thousand hours.
The Space Shuttle system is an almost ideal test-bed for this theory because
of the large number of systems and the long duration of use. Space Shuttle data,
compiled by T. Weber, Space System Division of Rockwell International (Ref. 1,
p. 93) tends to confirm this long-held belief.

Schedule margin is a period of time in which there are no scheduled activities.

series essentially eliminate failure to close.
Series redundant regulators significantly reduce the
quantity and probability of leakage. Probability of
failure to close is essentially eliminated. (These are
the most serious regulator failures in most designs.)
Probability of failure to open is increased.
Series Parallel Redundancy
Ordnance valves in sets of series-parallel pairs are a
common design in propulsion systems in cases where
there are long coast periods between firings. This
arrangement allows protection from failure to open
and failure to close as well a providing a sealed
system during coast periods. The penalty is weight
and cost
Fig. 2.14 Redundancy techniques for propulsion and fluid systems.
Note that going to two shifts in ATLO yields one week of margin per week.
There are numerous advantages to conducting a 7 x 24 ATLO phase: Building
time-powered-up is one advantage, and building schedule margin is another.
2.5 Redundancy Techniques
Redundancy is the most common method of increasing the failure tolerance of
a spacecraft. Redundancy is used at the piece part level (transistors, diodes, etc.),
at the circuit level, and the box level in electronics. In fluid systems it is used at
the component level (valves, regulators). In this section the types of redundancy
in common use will be described briefly with the characteristics of each.
Figure 2.14 shows the most commonly used redundancy techniques for propul-
sion and other fluid systems. Figure 2.15 shows the most commonly used redun-
dancy techniques for electronic systems. It should be noted that all redundancy
schemes require additional weight and cost. The cost is more than the cost of
the additional units; the analysis and testing of a redundant system is more time
consuming and expensive than single-string systems.
2.6 Launch Vehicle Interface
The launch vehicle represents the most critical interface with the spacecraft.
The selection of the launch vehicle is a major issue that is normally decided
by the customer very early in the design process. The critical technical interfaces
in the early phases of design are 1) launch mass capability, which determines

Active Parallel
Two active units in parallel redundancy reduce the
probability of failure of the function if:
1) additional equipment is not required to sense the
failure and switch the units.
2) the failure cause is very improbable or not common
to both units.
Redundant units with one unit in hot standby will
reduce the probability of failure of the function if:
1) the switching function has a vanishingly small
probability of failure.
2) the failure cause is either very improbable or not
common to both units
Parallel/Cross Strapped
This form of redundancy can withstand any failure of
unit a or unit b and some combinations of a and b
failures, unit a1 and b2 for example. However, cross
strapping adds significant complexity, provides
possible "sneak path" failure modes (which in turn,
requires extensive fault analysis). In addition, test
time is increased in order to cover all of the cross
strapped configurations.

the maximum acceptable mass of the spacecraft, and 2) fairing dynamic enve-
lope, which determines the maximum dimensions of the spacecraft in the launch
configuration.
As the design progresses the interface issues with the launch vehicle become
myriad. The integration process with the launch vehicle should start at least
36 months before launch for an expendable launch vehicle and 48 months for
a shuttle launch. In the detail design, the launch environment, loads, power, and
other issues become important.
Selected elements of launch vehicle integration are contained in this section.

2.6.1 Launch Mass
In recent years the number of available launch vehicles has increased enor-
mously. The launch mass capability of a small sample of the available vehicles is
shown in Fig. 2.16.
2.6.2 Upper Stages
There are a number of upper stages (sometimes called orbital transfer vehicles)
available to provide additional capability for launch vehicles. A given upper stage
may be used on several launch vehicles; see Isakowitz2 for additional detail. Note
that the upper stage weight, as loaded onto a launch vehicle, includes the pad
weight plus the airborne support equipment.

2.6.3 Fairing Dimensions
The launch vehicle aerodynamic fairing dimensions control the size of the space-
craft in the launch configuration; these dimensions are summarized in Table 2.15.
A spacecraft may exceed these dimensions in the cruise or on-orbit configurations
only through the use of deployment mechanisms.
The spacecraft cannot take full advantage of the fairing dimensions in Table 2.16;
provision must be made for the dynamic deflection of the fairing. The reduced
dimensions available to the spacecraft are called the dynamic envelope.
2.6.4 Spacecraft/Launch Vehicle Interface
Table 2.17 lists the primary areas in which technical integration with a launch
vehicle occurs and the accommodations available from two launch vehicles, Titan
IVB and the Space Shuttle.

The maximum spacecraft launch mass is 3230 kg. The required propellant load is
1788 kg and the pressurant mass is 8 kg. Make the following calculations for this
spacecraft.
(a) Establish a mass contingency using the AIAA recommendations; use cate-
gory CW, new spacecraft in the bid phase. Estimate launch vehicle adapter mass.
Establish an on-orbit dry mass budget for each subsystem.
Partial solution: Structure dry mass budget = 239 kg.
(b) Prepare a spreadsheet the project might use for a running comparison of
subsystem on-orbit dry mass budget to the current estimate.
(c) Estimate the total power requirement for the spacecraft. Set aside power
contingency using AIAA recommendations and allocate subsystem power budgets
(power to the loads). (In this case, add margin on top of the estimated subsystem
power. The total power estimate will be used to design the power system; the object
is to make sure the power system is big enough. The mass limit is absolute.)
Partial solution: Attitude control power budget is 61 W.

Orbital Mechanics
Much of the history of mathematical and physical thought was inspired by cu-
riosity about the motion of the planets—the very same laws that govern the motion
of spacecraft. The first observations of the celestial bodies predate recorded his-
tory. The inertial position of the vernal equinox vector was observed and recorded
in stone constructions—Stonehenge, for example—as early as 1800 B.C. Written
evidence of stellar observations was left by the Egyptians and the Babylonians
from about 3500 years ago. (The Babylonians of this era divided time into 60 even
units, a tradition that survives to this day.1)
In about 350 B.C. Aristotle explained the wandering motion of the planets by
proposing that the universe was composed of 55 concentric rotating spheres cen-
tered in the Earth. The outermost sphere contained the fixed stars; its rotation is
a very adequate explanation of the observed motion of stars in the night sky and
the irresistible image of a celestial sphere. The rotation of the inner sphere con-
taining the moon was also a simple, descriptive idea. The motion of the planets,
however, was much more difficult. Not only were the observing instruments crude
and the mathematical tools nonexistent, the Earth is a singularly poor observation
post for heliocentric motion. Usually the planets move slowly eastward across a
background of fixed stars; however, at times they reverse direction and move west-
ward. The retrograde loop of Mars is renowned. To explain this motion, Aristotle
invented the remaining 53 concentric spheres. Each planet was located in one of
the spheres, and its motion was influenced by the rotation of several other spheres.2
At about the same time a Greek named Aristarchus proposed a much simpler
theory in which the sun and stars were fixed and the planets rotated about the sun,
but this theory was not accepted. Aristotle's theory dominated scientific thought
for 1800 years.
In about 150 A.D. the Greek astronomer Ptolemy presented a more elaborate
Earth-centered theory, which held that the planets moved around the Earth in
small circles called epicycles, whose centers moved around in large circles called
deferents. The tables of planetary motion computed by Ptolemy based on this
theory were used for 1400 years.
In 1543 Nicholas Copernicus broke with Aristotle's theory and advocated sun-
centered rotation. His theory neatly explained the retrograde motion of the planets
as observed from Earth; however, measured positions were so crude at the time
that they fit Ptolemy's conception as well as that of Copernicus.
In about 1610 the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei made two observations that
reinforced the theory of Copernicus. First, he observed the motion of moons or-
biting Jupiter; thus at least some bodies must not orbit Earth. Second, he observed
moonlike phases of the sunlight on Venus that could not be explained by Ptolemy's
theory. Galileo attracted the wrath of the Catholic Church and was forced to recant
his observations.

In the late 1500s Tycho Brahe made the first accurate measurements of the
positions of the planets as a function of time. His achievement is all the more
remarkable because the telescope had not yet been invented. Brahe himself believed
in Ptolemy's theory of the universe, but his careful observations allowed Johannes
Kepler to describe mathematically the heliocentric motion of the planets and to
lay to rest the ancient theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy.
In early 1600, Kepler presented his three laws of planetary motion, which are
the basis of our understanding of planetary (and spacecraft) motion.
First Law. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse, with the sun at one focus.
Second Law: The line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in
equal times.
Third Law: The square of the period of a planetary orbit is proportional to the
cube of its mean radius.
In addition, Kepler contributed Kepler's equation, which relates position and
time. Kepler's equation is the most famous transcendental equation ever discov-
ered. Solving it for the time elapsed since periapsis when one is given orbital ele-
ments is trivial; solving it for orbital elements when one is given the time elapsed
since periapsis was the "Mount Everest" of mathematics for three centuries.
With Kepler's laws, the world had a description of planetary motion, but the
underlying cause of the motion was yet to come, and that would require the genius
of Isaac Newton. Newton was 23 and a student at Cambridge in 1665 when an
epidemic of the plague broke out. He moved to the relative safety of the coun-
tryside, where he spent the most productive two years of his life. Just one of his
achievements during that period was to develop the physics of planetary motion.
He postulated that all masses are attracted to one another with a force propor-
tional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between them. He further postulated that the mass of symmetrical
bodies could be concentrated at their centers. To test these assumptions, he formu-
lated the differential equations of motion for the planets and invented calculus
to solve them. The result confirmed Kepler's laws. By 1666 one man under-
stood planetary motion, but it would be another 20 years before the world had
the news.
Newton put this incredible piece of work aside and neither published it nor
discussed it until 20 years later, when he was questioned by his friend Edmund
Halley about planetary motion. Newton casually replied that he had already worked
it out and had it somewhere among his papers. At the urging of an astonished Halley,
Newton published his work in 1687 in Principia.2
3.1 Two-Body Motion
All of the celestial bodies, from a fleck of dust to a supernova, are attracted to
each other in accordance with Newton's law of universal gravitation:

ORBITAL MECHANICS 47
where
Fg = universal gravitational force between bodies
M, m — mass of the two bodies
G = universal gravitational constant
r = distance between the center of masses of the two bodies
The motion of a spacecraft in the universe is governed by an infinite network
of attractions to all celestial bodies. A rigorous analysis of this network would be
impossible; fortunately, the motion of a spacecraft in the solar system is dominated
by one central body at a time. This observation leads to the very useful two-body
assumptions:
1) The motion of a spacecraft is governed by attraction to a single central body.
2) The mass of the spacecraft is negligible compared to that of the central body.
3) The bodies are spherically symmetric with the masses concentrated at the
centers.
4) No forces act on the bodies except for gravitational forces and centrifugal
forces acting along the line of centers.
If the two-body assumptions hold, it can be shown that conic sections are the
only possible paths for orbiting bodies and that the central body must be at a focus
of the conic.4
The two-body assumptions are very nearly true. Table 3.1 shows the most sig-
nificant relative accelerations on a low Earth orbiter. The influence of Earth on
the spacecraft is more significant than any other influence by more than a factor
of 1000. The oblateness of the Earth also leads to errors in two-body solutions;
however, these errors are small and can be accurately predicted.
No explicit solution has been found for the TV-body problem except for N = 2;
however, numerical solutions are available for the N-body situation. These solu-
tions require a large computing capacity and are used only when the two-body
solution is suspect (e.g., a Mercury orbiter) or when high accuracy is required
(e.g., navigation calculations).

3.1.2 General Solution
Circular motion is a special case of two-body motion. Solving the general case
requires integration of the equations of motion; this solution is summarized in
the work of Koelle4 and elsewhere. The conclusions that can be drawn from the
general solution are more interesting than the solution itself:
1) Kepler's laws of planetary motion are confirmed and generalized to allow
orbits of any conic section, not just elliptical orbits. (Two-body motion is often
called Keplerian motion.)
2) The sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy of the orbiting body, per
unit mass, is a constant at all points in the orbit and is
V2 /xe = — - ^ (3.8)2 r
where s is the total mechanical energy per unit mass, or specific energy, of an object
in any orbit about a central body. The kinetic energy term in Eq. (3.8) is V2/2 and
the potential energy term is — /x/r. Potential energy is considered to be zero at
infinity and negative at radii less than infinity. Equation (3.8) can be reduced to
—s
where a is the semimajor axis (see Fig. 3.3). The total energy of any orbit depends
on the semimajor axis of the orbit only. For a circular orbit, a = r and specific

energy is negative. For an elliptical orbit, a is positive and specific energy is neg-
ative. Thus, for all closed orbits specific energy is negative. For parabolic orbits,
a = oo and specific energy is zero; as we will see, a parabolic orbit is a boundary
condition between hyperbolas and ellipses. For hyperbolic orbits, a is negative and
specific energy is positive. Figure 3.2 shows the relative energy for orbit types.
At a given radius, velocity and specific energy increase in the following order:
circular, elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic; total spacecraft energy increases in the
same order. Additional energy must be added to a spacecraft to change an orbit
from circular to elliptical. Energy must be removed to change from an elliptical to
a circular orbit. Both adding and removing energy requires a force on the vehicle
and in general that means consumption of propellant.
A particularly useful form of Eq. (3.9) is
2s(3.10)
3) Total angular momentum of the orbiting body is a constant, equal to the cross
product of the radius and the velocity vectors:
H = rxV (3.11)
where H is the angular momentum per unit mass (or specific momentum) and is a
vector quantity. From vector mechanics, the magnitude of H can be determined by
H = rVcosy (3.12)
where
H = magnitude of the specific momentum, km2/s
r = magnitude of the radius vector (the distance from the spacecraft to the
center of mass of the central body), km
V = magnitude of the velocity vector, km/s

vector; see Fig. 3.3), deg
Eccentricity e defines the shape of a conic orbit and is equal to c/a in Fig. 3.3.

equal to one for a parabolic orbit, and is greater than one for a hyperbolic orbit.
Specific energy and eccentricity are related as follows:

The most useful relation resulting from the general two-body solution is the
energy integral (also called the vis-viva integral), which yields the general relation
for the velocity of an orbiting body:
V = y/(2fji/r) - (3.14)
Equation (3.14) yields spacecraft velocity at any point on any conic orbit. For each
conic it can be reduced, if desired, to a specific relation.

any point on any orbit and can be used in cases wfere the orbittype is not known.
These relations also are summarized in Table 3JL.

1) Given r and V, the specific energy can be calculated from Eq. (3.8).
2) With specific energy, the semimajor axis can be obtained from Eq. (3.10).
3) Given r, V, and y, the magnitude of specific momentum can be obtained
from Eq. (3.12).
4) With specific momentum and the semimajor axis, eccentricity can be obtained
from Eq. (3.13).
5) From the characteristics of the eccentricities, the orbit type can be determined
from inspection, Table 3.2.
Eccentricity and the semimajor axis define a conic orbit. Knowing these two
elements and the orbit type, any other element can be obtained using the relations
derived in subsequent sections.
Example 3.2 Defining an Orbit Given r, V, and 7
An Earth-orbiting spacecraft has been observed to have a velocity of 10.7654
km/s at an altitude of 1500 km and a flight path angle of 23.174 deg; determine
the orbit elements e and a and the orbit type.
The orbital radius is 1500 + 6378.14 = 7878.14 km. Determine the specific
energy from Eq. (3.8):
(10.7654)2 398600.4 „ _
[One of the problems with using Eq. (3.8) is the subtraction of two large numbers,
which reduces accuracy. Intermediate steps must be taken to four or five places.]
With s set, a can be calculated from Eq. (3.10):
The negative semimajor axis indicates that the orbit is a hyperbolic departure.
Calculating specific momentum from Eq. (3.12),
H = (7878. 14)(10.7654) cos(23. 174) = 77968.2 knrVs
With the semimajor axis and specific momentum, eccentricity can be calculated
from Eq. (3.13)
(77968'2)2 = 1.250(398600.4X-27111.36)
An eccentricity larger than 1 confirms that the orbit is a hyperbolic departure.

3.1.3 Elliptical Orbits
Elliptical orbits are by far the most common orbits. All planets and most space-
craft move in elliptical orbits. The geometry of an elliptical orbit is shown in
Fig. 3.3.
3.1.3.1 Defining an elliptical orbit. An elliptical orbit is most frequently
defined in terms of these orbital elements:
a = semimajor axis
e = eccentricity
ra — apoapsis radius
rp = periapsis radius
The periapsis of an orbit is the point of closest approach to the central body or
the point of minimum radius. The apoapsis is the point of maximum radius. The
apoapsis, periapsis, and center of mass of the central body are joined by the line
of apsides.
Periapsis and apoapsis are general terms for orbits about any central body; there
are also body-specific terms:
General: Periapsis Apoapsis
Sun: Perihelion Aphelion
Earth: Perigee Apogee
Moon: Perilune Apolune
By inspection, the long axis of an elliptical orbit is the sum of the apoapsis radius
and the periapsis radius. It is useful to define the semimajor axis a as one-half of
the long axis. Therefore,
a = (ra+rp)/2 (3.17)

<<<PAGE 67>>>

ORBITAL MECHANICS 55
The semimajor axis is one of the classical orbital elements. It defines the size of
the orbit and indicates the energy of the orbit. In astronomical work the semimajor
axis is often called the mean distance; this term is misleading, however, because
the semimajor axis is not equal to the time-average radius.
Similarly, the distance between elliptical foci is 2c, and
c = (ra-rp)/2 (3.18)
Eccentricity e is one of the classical orbital elements. As previously stated,
eccentricity defines the shape of an orbit, and it is defined as
e = c/a (3.19)
Thus,
e = r° ~ Tp (3.20)
ra + rp
The semiminor axis b of an ellipse is related to a and c as follows:
a2=£2 + c2 (3.21)
As shown in Fig. 3.4, a spacecraft position in orbit is defined by the radius r and
the position angle 0, called the true anomaly, which is measured from the periapsis
to the spacecraft in the direction of motion. Given an orbit defined by e and a, the
radius to a position can be calculated using the true anomaly as follows:
n(\ — ^

Example 3.3 True Anomaly at a Point
Given an elliptical Earth orbit with a perigee radius of 6500 km and apogee
radius of 60,000 km, find the true anomaly of the spacecraft position as it enters
the Van Alien belt at an altitude of about 500 km.
Find the eccentricity by using Eq. (3.20):
60,000 - 6500e = = 0.804560,000 + 6500
Find true anomaly at an altitude of 500 km (Earth radius is from Appendix B):
r = 6378.14 + 500 = 6878.14 km
From Eq. (3.24)
COS 9 =1 (6500)(1 + 0.8045) _ ___
(6878.14)(0.8045) ~ 0.8045
0 = 28.755 deg
Note that the altitude (or radius) defines two positions on an orbit; therefore, the
radius in this example will be 6878.14 km when the true anomaly is either 28.755
deg or 331.245 deg.
It is sometimes necessary to design an elliptical orbit to pass through two given
points, as shown in Fig. 3.5; two points are sufficient to design a unique elliptical
orbit. Intercept trajectories and interplanetary orbits are designed in this way.
From Eq. (3.23), the relations for r\ and r^ can be given as

Design a transfer ellipse from Earth at a heliocentric position of r = 1.00 AU
and a longitude of 41.26° to Pluto at r = 39.5574 AU and a longitude of 194.66°.
Place the line of apsides at a longitude of 25°.
The true anomaly of a spacecraft at Earth's position is 41.26 deg — 25 =
16.26 deg. Similarly, at Pluto's position, the true anomaly is 194.66 deg — 25 =
169.66 deg.
The radii of date of the planets are

3. 1.3.2 Defining parameters at a point. Having defined the orbit, it is
now possible to define the parameters at any point on the orbit. The radius and true
anomaly define the orbit point. The parameters of interest at a point are flight path
angle y, velocity V, and time since periapsis t.
Flight path angle. Flight path angle is defined as the angle between the local
horizontal and the velocity vector, as shown in Fig. 3.6. It might seem strange to
consider local horizontal and vertical in a 0-g situation; however, the horizontal at
any point can be defined as perpendicular to the radius vector.
The relation between radius and flight path angle can be readily derived by
noting that

Differentiating Eq. (3.30) and rearranging yields
e sinOtany =\+e cos 9(3.31)
Flight path angle varies with orbital position as shown in Fig. 3.7. As a spacecraft
flies around an orbit, its flight path angle is zero at periapsis; it is positive as
the spacecraft rises to apoapsis. It is zero again at apoapsis and negative as the
spacecraft descends to periapsis.
Velocity. Velocity at any point is calculated from the general velocity equation
as previously discussed:
V = v/(2/z/r) - (3.14)
Another useful velocity relationship can be obtained from the equation for angular
momentum. From Eq. (3.11), the angular momentum vector is

Angular momentum is constant for any point on an orbit; therefore,
nVn =r2Vt2 (3.32)
where Vt is tangential velocity component.
Since flight path angle is zero at periapsis and apoapsis,
rpVp = raVa (3.33)
Time since periapsis. The time taken by a spacecraft to move from periapsis
to a given true anomaly (time since periapsis) is computed using the famous Kepler
equation:
t = (E -esinE)/n (3.34)
where
t = time since periapsis
E = eccentric anomaly, rad
e = eccentricity of orbit
n = mean motion
Figure 3.8 shows the geometric relationship between the eccentric anomaly and
the true anomaly.
The eccentric anomaly traces a point on a circle, with radius equal to a, that cir-
cumscribes the elliptical orbit. As eccentricity goes to zero, the eccentric anomaly
and true anomaly merge. The relation between eccentric and true anomaly is
/o <3cxcos£ — —————— (3.35)1 + e cos 0
If the spacecraft were traveling on the circumscribing circle shown in Fig. 3.8,
rather than the elliptical orbit, it would have an angular velocity equal to the mean
motion,
n = vWtf3 (3.36)
Equation (3.34) does not yield time values greater than one half of the orbit
period. For true anomalies greater than n , the result obtained from Eq. (3.34) must
be subtracted from the orbit period to obtain the correct time since periapsis. Note
also that in using Eqs. (3.34) and (3.35), all angles must be expressed in radians.

Kepler's equation has attracted the attention of mathematicians for centuries.
It is tractable when being used to calculate the time since periapsis given the
orbit parameters. The historic interest, however, stems from attempts to deduce
orbit parameters knowing the time since periapsis. Obtaining a solution in this
direction is very difficult indeed. Many of the great mathematical minds of all
time attempted to solve Kepler's equation—Newton, Euler, Gauss, Laplace, and
Lagrange, to name a few. It is interesting to speculate as to how mathematics would
have developed if Kepler's equation were trivial.
Orbital period. When E = 2n, Kepler's equation reduces to Kepler's third
law, the relation for elliptical orbit period:
P = 2n/n (3.37)
P = 27t^a3/fj, (3.38)
where P equals the orbital period in seconds. The orbital period for a circular orbit,
given by Eq. (3.7), is a special case of Eq. (3.38), with a = r.
Example 3.5 Parameters at a Point
The elements of the Magellan mapping orbit about Venus are as follows:
a = 10,424.1km

3.1.3.3 Summary of relations for elliptical orbits. There are myriad re-
lations between the principle elements of elliptical orbits that can be derived alge-
braically from the foregoing definitions; many of these are tabulated in the work
of Wood5 and elsewhere. The relations in Table 3.3 are an adequate working set.
3. 1.4 Parabolic Orbits
A parabolic orbit would be achieved by an object falling from an infinite distance
toward a central body. Such a fall essentially describes the motion of comets, and
as a result, comets approach parabolic orbits. The process is reversible. If an object
were propelled to the velocity for a parabolic orbit, it would just reach infinity.
A parabolic orbit, shown in Fig. 3.9, represents the boundary condition between
an elliptic orbit and a hyperbolic orbit. A parabola can be considered an ellipse
with an infinite semimajor axis. The arms become parallel as r approaches infinity
and when e = 1 and a = oo. The velocity along a parabolic orbit is
V = vV/V (3.15)
Parabolic orbits are the least energetic open orbits. The velocity on a parabolic
orbit is the minimum velocity needed for a spacecraft to escape the central body;
i.e., parabolic velocity is the escape velocity. Note that the escape velocity is an
inverse function of the square root of the radius; the greater the spacecraft altitude,
the lower the escape velocity.

From Eq. (3.15) the lunar escape velocity is
V = v/(2)(4902.8)/1738 = 2.375 km/s
Parabolic orbits are an interesting boundary condition but not a useful spacecraft
trajectory.
3.1.5 Hyperbolic Orbits
Hyperbolic orbits are used for Earth departure on planetary flights and for plan-
etary arrival and targeting. Hyperbolic planetary flyby orbits are used for energetic
gravity-assist maneuvers that change the direction and magnitude of spacecraft
velocity without expending spacecraft resources. At any radius, a spacecraft on a
hyperbolic orbit has a greater velocity than it would on a parabolic orbit; thus all
hyperbolas are escape trajectories. Figure 3.10 shows the geometry of a hyperbolic
trajectory. The orbital parameters are similar to those of an ellipse:
rp = periapsis radius
a = semimajor axis, the distance from the center to the periapsis
b = semiminor axis, the distance from the asymptote to a parallel passing
through the central body

In the region between the minimum Oa and the maximum Oa , the hyperbolic radius is
infinite. FromEq. (3.52), the true anomaly of the asymptote can also be expressed as

same way:

The velocity at any point on a hyperbola is
V = y/VfJL/r) + (fi/a) (3.16)
The velocity on a hyperbolic trajectory is greater than the velocity on a parabola
at any radius. The parabolic velocity goes to zero for an infinite radius; on a
hyperbolic trajectory, the velocity at infinity is finite and equal to
V^ = J^Ta (3.55)
VQO is the velocity in excess of the escape velocity and is called the hyperbolic
excess velocity (VHE) when Earth escape is intended. For all situations other than
Earth escape, V^ is the preferable term. For the equations in this text, VHE and VOQ
may be used interchangeably.
Voc - VHE = V/V^ (3.56)
V - ^(2/x/r) + V£E (3.57)
VHE is the velocity that must be added to the Earth's velocity to achieve departure
on a planetary mission. It is traditional to express the energy required of a launch
vehicle for a planetary mission as C3, which is the square of VHE'
C3 - VH2E (3.58)

an arrival at a planet.

3.1.5.1 Gravity-assist maneuvers. The angle through which a spacecraft
velocity vector is turned by an encounter with a planet is 180 deg — 2ft. This type
of encounter is called a gravity-assist maneuver; it is a very energetic maneuver
that can be accomplished without expending spacecraft resources.
The 1989 Galileo mission would not have been possible without multiple gravity-
assist turns at Venus and Earth. Gravity-assist trajectories were also used by
Voyager to target from one outer planet to the next at a substantial reduction
in time of flight. The Ulysses mission, to take scientific data over the polar region
of the sun, would not be possible in any year without a gravity turn out of the
ecliptic. As shown in Fig. 3.11, Ulysses uses the gravitational attraction of Jupiter
to bend its trajectory out of the ecliptic plane and send it on its way over the polar
region of the sun. The design of this important maneuver will be discussed in
Section 3.5.
3.1.5.2 Time of flight. The time since periapsis can be determined in a man-
ner analogous to that for elliptical orbits with the aid of the hyperbolic eccentric
anomaly F:

Voo and VHE are used interchangeably in Table 3.4.
3.1.6 Time Systems
Mission design calculations, especially ephemeris calculations, require a more
precise definition of how time is measured and of the relationship between time and
planetary position. Five different time measurement systems must be understood.
3.1.6.1 Apparent solar time. The most ancient measure of time is the
apparent solar day. It is the time interval between two successive solar transits
across a local meridian, i.e., two successive high noons. Two motions are involved
in this definition: the rotation of the Earth about its axis and the revolution of the
Earth about the sun, as shown in Fig. 3.12. The apparent solar day can be measured
by a sundial and was an adequate standard for thousands of years.
3.1.6.2 Mean solar time. One of the problems with apparent solar time
is that the days are all of different lengths. This variation occurs because the
Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, the Earth's orbit is not
circular, and the Earth's axis wobbles slightly with respect to the ecliptic plane.
These effects are all small, regular, and predictable; therefore, it is possible to
establish a mean solar day that has an invariant length. A mean solar day is
defined based on the assumptions that the Earth is in a circular orbit with pe-
riod exactly equal to the actual period of the Earth's orbit and that the Earth's
axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. The mean solar day is the common
time standard; it is the time you read from your watch. Seconds, minutes, and
hours are defined in duration by dividing a mean solar day into equal parts. A
mean solar day is equal to exactly 24 h, or 1440 min, or 86,400 s.
3.1.6.3 Sidereal time. For some purposes, notably astronomy, it is neces-

A mean sidereal day is the mean time required for the Earth to rotate once on its
axis with respect to fixed stars, or with respect to inertial space. A mean sidereal
day is slightly shorter than a mean solar day, as shown in Fig. 3.13. A sidereal

3.1.6.4 Time zones and universal time. Another problem with solar
time is that the time of day is different at every longitude on Earth. Up until the
mid-1800s every town in the United States set its clock by local high noon. The
advent of railroads changed all that. To operate a train schedule it was necessary to
standardize time. The Earth is now subdivided into 24 standard time zones, each
encompassing approximately 15° of longitude. Greenwich, England is the index
mark for time zones. The mean solar time at Greenwich is called universal time
(UT). (Greenwich mean time, an early standard used prior to 1925, was similar to
universal time except that a new day was started at noon rather than at midnight.)
Table 3.5 shows the conversion of universal time to local mean solar times for the
United States. Interestingly enough, universal time is computed from solar motion
in mean sidereal time and then converted to mean solar time. Universal time is
expressed by the 24-h clock method; i.e., 4 p.m. is stated as 16:00.
3.1.6.5 Julian days. The Julian day system is a means of providing a unique
number to all days that have elapsed since a standard reference day in the distant
past. The day selected for the starting point of the system is 1 January 4713 B.C.
The days are in mean solar measure. The Julian day (JD) numbers are never
repeated and are not partitioned into weeks or months. As a result, the number of
days between two dates may be obtained by subtracting Julian day numbers.
There are 36,525 mean solar days in a Julian century and 86,400 s in a day.
The Julian century does not refer to some time system; it is merely a count of a
fixed number of days. Ephemeris calculations are done in Julian days and Julian
centuries.
This curious system was devised by Joseph Scaliger in 1582 to provide a calendar
suitable for recording astronomical observations.9 The starting date was selected
because it is the starting point of three cycles: the 28-year solar cycle, the 19-year
lunar cycle, and the 15-year tax cycle in use at the time. In spite of the general
inconvenience of the system, it is still, four centuries later, the only generally
recognized system of unique day numbers.
A Julian day starts at noon UT rather than at midnight, an astronomical custom;
astronomers find it disconcerting for the day number to change in the middle of a
night's observations. This custom has a curious effect on the conversion of Julian
days to equivalent Gregorian calendar (the common calendar) days, as shown in
Fig. 3.14. Julian dates may be calculated from calendar dates using Eq. (3.84),

3.1.7 Coordinate Systems
Four types of coordinate systems are common in mission design work: 1) the
geocentric-inertial system, 2) the heliocentric-inertial system, 3) the geographic-
body-fixed system, and 4) the International Astronomical Union (IAU) carto-
graphic system (for the planets). The systems are designed to make various types

of motion easy to visualize; selection of the proper coordinate system has a pro-
found effect on the difficulty of a given type of problem. Each system is defined
by the selection of the origin, selection of axes, and the determination of what
is fixed.
A body-fixed coordinate system measures all motion relative to that body with
the assumption that the body is stationary. Our daily experience is in body-fixed
coordinates where the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west. An inertially
fixed coordinate system is one which is referenced to stellar positions. The vernal
equinox vector is the primary reference in such systems.
3.1.7.1 Vernal equinox. There are two equinoxes in a year, one in the
spring and one in the fall. On these days the Earth is located at the intersection
line of the equatorial and ecliptic planes. The axis of rotation of the Earth is
in a plane perpendicular to the sun's rays; as a result the length of the day and
night is the same everywhere on Earth. As shown in Fig. 3.15, the vernal equinox
vector is the vector from the center of mass of the Earth to the center of mass of
the sun on the spring (northern hemisphere) equinox day, which occurs around
21 March.
The vernal equinox was first observed more than 5000 years ago; at that time
the vector passed through Aries (a constellation in the zodiac also called the Ram).
The sign of the Ram, T, is used to this day to indicate the vernal equinox; however,
over the years the vector has moved through Aries and into Pisces (the Fish).11
This small precession of the equinoxes, about 0.014 deg per year, does not prevent
consideration of the vector as fixed for most purposes; however, this precession

and the motion of the ecliptic plane are important for ephemeris calculations.
Ephemeris tabulations are noted to indicate the instant of time that defines the
exact position of the reference axes.
3.1.7.2 Geocentric-inertial coordinate system. For most orbital calcu-
lations the coordinate system of choice is the geocentric-inertial system, shown in
Fig. 3.16. The origin for the geocentric system is the center of mass of the central
body, which is usually, but not necessarily, the Earth. The equatorial plane (the
plane of the Earth's equator) is the reference plane. The X axis is the vernal equinox
vector, and the Z axis is the spin axis of the Earth; north is positive. The axes are
fixed in inertial space or fixed with respect to the stars.
Positions are measured by latitude and longitude; longitudes are measured
eastward (i.e., counterclockwise as viewed from celestial north) from the ver-
nal equinox vector and centered in the Earth. North latitudes are measured in the
positive Z direction from the equatorial plane, and south latitudes are measured in
a negative Z direction.
3.1.7.3 Heliocentric-inertial system. The heliocentric-inertial system is
used for interplanetary mission design. The ecliptic plane, the plane that contains
the center of mass of the sun and the orbit of the Earth, is the reference plane for
the heliocentric system. The system is identical to the geocentric-inertial system
shown in Fig. 3.16 except for the reference plane and the central body. The origin
for the system is centered in the sun, and the system is fixed with respect to the
stars. The equatorial plane is inclined at an angle of approximately 23.5 deg with
respect to the ecliptic. The X axis for the heliocentric system is the vernal equinox
vector, which is common to the ecliptic plane and the equatorial plane. The Z axis is

perpendicular to the ecliptic; positive is north. Latitude and longitude are measured
as in the geocentric system.
3.1.7.4 Geographic-body-fixed coordinate system. The geographic-
body-fixed coordinate system, shown in Fig. 3.17, has been used for centuries to lo-
cate and map positions on the Earth. The system is Earth-centered and body-fixed;
the surface of the Earth is divided into a grid of latitude and longitude measured in
degrees. Spacecraft ground track is commonly plotted in this coordinate system.
Longitude is a spherical angle measured around the polar axis, starting at the
prime meridian. The prime meridian is the great circle passing through Greenwich,
England, and the Earth's poles. Longitude is measured in degrees east or west from
the prime meridian (the highest longitude being 180°). The longitude of New York
is approximately 75°W. Both east and west longitudes are positive.
Latitude is a spherical angle measured around the center of the Earth starting
from 0° at the equator. Latitude is measured north or south of the equator with the
highest latitude being 90°. Both north and south latitudes are positive. Philadelphia
and Denver are at approximately 40° N.
The geographic system is most frequently mapped as a Mercator projection,
which projects an Earth map on a cylinder wrapped around the equator.
3.1.7.5 International Astronomical Union cartographic coordinates.
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) cartographic system is a body-
centered, body-fixed system for mapping solar system bodies. International agree-
ment has been established by the IAU on the placement of the north polar axis, the
equatorial plane, and the prime meridian for the planets and their satellites.12 The

north pole is placed in the northern celestial hemisphere regardless of the direction
of rotation of the body. Parameters specifying the orientation of the north pole and
the location of the prime meridian vary slowly with time and can be obtained from
Ref. 12.
Longitudes are reckoned in an eastward direction from the prime meridian,
i.e., in a counterclockwise direction as viewed from the north pole. Unlike the
geographic system, longitudes increase from 0° to 360°; latitudes north of the
equator are positive, and southern latitudes are negative.
3.1.8 Classical Orbital Elements
There are a number of independent parameters describing the size, shape, and
spatial position of an orbit. Six of these have become the parameters of choice to
define and describe an orbit. These six parameters (see Fig. 3.18) are called the
classical orbital elements:
e = Eccentricity: the ratio of minor to major dimensions of an orbit defines the
shape.
a = Semimajor axis: the orbit size is defined by one half of the major axis
dimension. (Circular orbits are defined by radius.)
/ = Inclination: the angle between the orbit plane and the reference plane or
the angle between the normals to the two planes.
o) = Argument of periapsis: the angle from the ascending node to the periapsis,
measured in the orbital plane in the direction of spacecraft motion. The ascending
node is the point where the spacecraft crosses the reference plane headed from
south to north. The line of nodes is the line formed by the intersection of the orbit
plane and the reference plane. The ascending node and the descending node are
on this line.
Q = Longitude of the ascending node: the angle between the vernal equinox
vector and the ascending node measured in the reference plane in a counterclock-
wise direction as viewed from the northern hemisphere.
0 = True anomaly: the sixth element locates the spacecraft position on the
orbit. (Time since periapsis is also used as this orbital element.3)

Fig. 3.19 Changing a circular orbit to an elliptical orbit.
For orbits about the Earth or planets, the elements are located with respect to the
geocentric system. For interplanetary orbits the elements are given with respect to
the heliocentric system. The coordinate system, the orbital elements, and the orbit
itself are fixed in inertial space and do not rotate with the central body.
3.2 Orbital Maneuvers
Orbital maneuvering is based on the fundamental principle that an orbit is
uniquely determined by the position and velocity at any point. Conversely, chang-
ing the velocity vector at any point instantly transforms the trajectory to correspond
to the new velocity vector. For example, to change from a circular orbit to an
elliptical orbit, the spacecraft velocity must be increased to that of an elliptic orbit,
as shown in Fig. 3.19.
In Fig. 3.19,
V (circle) + AV = V (ellipse) (3.85)
3.2.1 In-Plane Orbit Changes
Any conic orbit can be converted to any other conic orbit by adjusting velocity;
a spacecraft travels on the trajectory defined by its velocity at a point. Circular
trajectories can be converted to ellipses, ellipses can be changed in eccentricity,
and circles or ellipses can be changed to hyperbolas—all by adjusting velocity.
Example 3.10 Simple Coplanar Orbit Change
Consider an initial circular, low Earth orbit at a 300-km altitude. What velocity
increase would be required to produce an elliptical orbit with a 300-km altitude at
periapsis and a 3000-km altitude at apoapsis?

The velocity at periapsis is, from Eq. (3.14),
398,600.4
The velocity increase required to convert the initial circular orbit to the final
elliptical orbit is 8.350 - 7.726 - 0.624 km/s. The velocity should be increased
at the point of desired periapsis placement. Table 3.6 shows the results of various
velocity changes from an initial 300-km Earth orbit. In Table 3.6 it is assumed that
the magnitude of velocity is changed without changing the direction. The radius
at the point at which the velocity is changed remains unchanged. Velocity changes
made at the periapsis change the apoapsis radius but not the periapsis radius, and
vice versa. As would be expected, the plane of orbit in inertial space does not
change as velocity along the orbit is changed. Orbital changes are a reversible
process.
Figure 3.20 shows the general coplanar maneuver, which changes the initial
orbit velocity V/ to an intersecting coplanar orbit with velocity V/. The velocity
on the final orbit is equal to the vector sum of the initial velocity and the velocity
change vector. Applying the cosine law,

3.2.2 Hohmann Transfer
Suppose you need to transfer between two nonintersecting orbits; how can
you do it? The Hohmann transfer, shown in Fig. 3.21, answers this need in a
most efficient way. The Hohmann transfer, devised by Walter Hohmann in 1925,
employs an elliptical transfer orbit that is tangent to the initial and final orbits at
the apsides.13
To design a Hohmann transfer between two circular, coplanar orbits, set the
periapsis radius of the transfer ellipse equal to the radius of the initial orbit, and
set the apoapsis radius equal to the radius of the final orbit:
(3.87)
(3.88)pt
With these two radii set, the transfer ellipse is defined.
There are two velocity increments required to accomplish the transfer. One
increment changes the initial velocity of the spacecraft to the velocity needed on

the transfer ellipse, and a second increment changes from the velocity needed on
the transfer ellipse to the velocity needed on the final orbit:
= Vpt - Vt (3.89)
AV2 = Vat - Vf (3.90)
where
Vpt = the periapsis velocity on the transfer ellipse
Vat = the apoapsis velocity on the transfer ellipse
Vf = the spacecraft velocity on the initial orbit
Vf = the spacecraft velocity on the final orbit
A transfer between two circular orbits is shown in Fig. 3.21, but the transfer could
as well have been between elliptical orbits. Similarly, the transfer could have been
from a high orbit to a low orbit.
Example 3.12 Hohmann Transfer
Design a Hohmann transfer from a circular Mars orbit of radius 8000 km to a
circular Mars orbit of radius 15,000 km.
For Mars,
/x = 42,828.3 kmVs2
The velocity on the initial orbit is, from Eq. (3.6),
1 =
8000
Similarly, the velocity on the final orbit is found to be 1.690 km/s.
The semimajor axis of the transfer ellipse is, from Eq. (3.17),
a = (8000 + 15,000)/2 = 11,500 km
The velocity at periapsis of the transfer ellipse is, from Eq. (3.14),
2(42,828.3) 42,828.3
8000
Similarly the velocity at apoapsis is
2(42,828.3) 42,828.3
There is another, possibly easier way to calculate the velocity at apoapsis by
using Eq. (3.32):
T/ (8000)(2.642)Va = ———————— = 1.409 km/s15,000

<<<PAGE 93>>>

ORBITAL MECHANICS 81
The velocity change required to enter the transfer orbit is found by using
Eq. (3.89):
A Vi = 2.642 - 2.314 = 0.328 km/s
Similarly from Eq. (3.90), the velocity change to "circularize" is 0.281 km/s, and
the total velocity change for the transfer is 0.609 km/s.
The time required to make the transfer is one half the period of the transfer
ellipse, or from Eq. (3.38),
The time for transfer is 18,271 s, or about 5.2 h.
The efficiency of the Hohmann transfer stems from the fact that the two velocity
changes are made at points of tangency between the trajectories; therefore, only
the magnitude of the velocity is changed without the energy losses associated with
a change in direction.
3.2.3 Plane Changes
So far only in-plane changes to orbits have been considered. What happens when
a spacecraft must change orbit planes to accomplish its mission? Such a change is
accomplished by applying an out-of-plane impulse at the intersection of the initial
and final orbit planes, as shown in Fig. 3.22. By inspection of Fig. 3.22, or from
the law of cosines,
AV = 2V;-sin(ar/2) (3.91)
where
A V = the velocity change required to produce a plane change
Vt = the velocity of the spacecraft on the initial orbit at the intersection
of the initial and final orbit planes
a = the angle of the plane change
Spacecraft speed is unaltered by the plane change; thus,

Orbit shape is unaffected; therefore, eccentricity, semimajor axis, and radii are
unchanged.
Plane changes are expensive as far as energy is concerned. A 10-deg plane
change in low Earth orbit requires a velocity change of 1.4 km/s. Equation (3.91)
shows that it is important to change planes through the smallest possible angle and
at the lowest possible velocity. The lowest possible velocity occurs at the greatest
radius, i.e., at the apoapsis.
The maximum displacement between positions on the initial and final orbits
occurs at 90 deg from the point of plane change. There are two such points, A and
B, in Fig. 3.22.
A change in orbit plane can result in a change in inclination, the longitude of
the ascending node, or both, as shown in Fig. 3.23. A spherical triangle, with one
side and two angles known, is formed by //, 180 — //, and A £2. To design a plane
change with the desired effect on inclination and longitude of ascending node, the
necessary angle of plane change can be found from the cosine law of spherical
trigonometry:
cos a = cos // cos if + sin // sin if cos(A£2) (3.93)
The velocity change A V required to provide a plane change a can be obtained from
Eq. (3.91). The argument of latitude on the initial orbit, at which the maneuver
must be performed, is given by the sine law of spherical trigonometry:
sin if sin(A£2)

h = 215 km
/ = 28.5 deg
ft = 60° west
It is desired to make a plane change to a circular orbit with the following final
characteristics:
h = 215 km
/ = 10 deg
ft = 100° west
Design the plane change. The angle of the plane change, from Eq. (3.93), is
cos a = cos(28.5)cos(10) + sin(28.5)sin(10)cos(40)
a = 21.730 deg
The argument of latitude on the initial orbit at which the impulse must be applied,
from Eq. (3.94), is
sin(10)sin(40)
SinALa= sm(21.730)
ALa = 17.547 deg
The velocity on the initial and final orbit, found by using Eq. (3.6), is
7.740 km/s. The velocity change required for the plane change, from Eq. (3.91), is
AV = 2(7.740) sin(21.730/2) = 2.918 km/s
If spacecraft velocity is changed at the reference plane, i.e., at one of the nodes,
the inclination of the orbit will be changed, and the longitude of the ascending
node will not be changed. The change in inclination will be
A/ = a (3.96)
where a is the angle between initial and final velocity vectors. Inclination is the
only orbital parameter changed by adding out-of-plane velocity at one of the nodes.

3.2.4 Combined Maneuvers
Significant energy savings can be made if in-plane and out-of-plane maneuvers
can be combined. The savings result from the fact that any side of a vector triangle
is always smaller than the sum of the other two sides. The maneuvers necessary
to establish a geosynchronous orbit provide an excellent example of combined
maneuver savings. The final two maneuvers, shown in Fig. 3.24, are an in-plane
orbit circularization and a 28.5-deg plane change. The plane change maneuver at
a velocity of 1.606 km/s would require a AV of 0.791 km/s. The circularization
maneuver would change the velocity at apoapsis on the transfer ellipse to the
circular orbit velocity of 3.0747 km/s; this maneuver would require a A V of 1.4687
km/s. The total for velocity change for the two maneuvers, conducted separately,
would be 2.260 km/s. Combining the two maneuvers, however, requires a velocity
change of only 1.831 km/s, a savings of 0.429 km/s. (See Section 3.4 for a complete
description of the geosynchronous mission design.) Watch for opportunities to
combine maneuvers. Every plane change offers an opportunity of this kind.
3.2.5 Propulsion for Maneuvers
The ultimate result of a velocity change requirement is reflected in the propellant
mass required to accomplish it. The equations for converting a velocity change to
an equivalent propellant mass are derived and discussed in Chapter 4, "Propulsion."
For here, suffice it to say that velocity changed is very expensive in mass terms. Any
orbital mechanics devices, such as combined maneuvers, which reduce velocity
change requirements, have a very beneficial effect on the overall spacecraft design.
3.3 Observing the Central Body
One of the principle uses of spacecraft is for observation of a central body from
the unique position of space. The position of a spacecraft over the central body is
determined by the orbital parameters already discussed and by the properties of the
launch, launch site, and perturbations to the orbit. This section discusses each of
these effects, and also discusses the view from a spacecraft given its position. Ob-
servations of the Earth are charted from space in the geographic coordinate system;
observations of other planets are recorded in the similar IAU cartographic system.

3.3.1 Effect of the Launch Site
Both the latitude of the launch location and the allowable launch azimuth range
have a profound effect on orbital parameters. In general, southerly launches al-
low polar orbits, and easterly launches take advantage of the Earth's rotation and
produce low-inclination orbits. The more nearly equatorial the launch site is, the
greater the range of orbit inclinations that can be achieved.
Figure 3.25 shows a launch site at latitude La and a launch azimuth Az. Latitude
is measured on a great circle through the north pole, perpendicular to the equatorial
plane. Azimuth is measured from true north, which is a vector in the latitude circle,
to the launch direction vector. The launch direction vector is in the orbit plane. On
the first orbit after launch, the spacecraft crosses the equatorial plane at the orbit
inclination angle i.
A right spherical triangle is formed by the side La and by the two angles Az and
/. From spherical trigonometry,
cos i = cos La sin Az (3.106)
where
/ = the orbit inclination
Az = the launch azimuth, the angle from true north to the departure
trajectory
La = the latitude of the launch platform
Equation (3.106) assumes a nonrotating Earth. To adjust for a rotating Earth, adjust
the azimuth and orbital velocity by adding the Earth's eastward rotational vector,
as shown in Fig. 3.26. In Fig. 3.26,

Ve = the eastward rotational velocity of Earth
V0 = the orbital velocity over a nonrotating Earth
V0 = the orbital velocity corrected for Earth's rotation
AT! = the launch azimuth corrected for Earth's rotation
The rotating Earth correction of the azimuth is usually small enough to be ne-
glected; however, the velocity addition is important. Missions requiring high launch
energy (e.g., geosynchronous or planetary missions) usually launch due east to
obtain the maximum benefits of Earth rotation.
Equation (3.106) produces a minimum inclination when the launch azimuth is
due east (90°) or west (270°). The latitude of the launch site is numerically equal
to the minimum orbital inclination that can be achieved from that site.
3.3.1.1 Launch latitude. The latitudes of selected launch sites of the world
are listed in Table 3.7. The United States operates two major launch sites. The
eastern test range at Cape Canaveral, Florida, is called the Kennedy Space Flight
Center (KSC) by NASA and Cape Canaveral or eastern test range (ETR) by the
Air Force; in this chapter we will use ETR. The western test range, near Lompoc,
California, is called either Vandenberg Air Force Base or WTR; we will use WTR.
These two sites were chosen for their advantageous latitude and coastal positions.
The minimum orbit inclination that a U.S. spacecraft can have without a plane
change is 28.5°, the latitude of ETR. The European Space Agency has a launch
site in South America at a latitude of 5.2° N. The former USSR, with launch sites
at latitudes of 45.6° and 62.9° has difficulty achieving low orbit inclinations. The
new mobile Sea Launch Odyssey can achieve any inclination from 0 to 100°.
3.3.1.2 Launch azimuth. Given a launch site, the desired orbit inclination
is obtained by selection of a launch azimuth in accordance with Eq. (3.106). How-
ever, the usable range of launch azimuths is restricted by safety considerations.
The area underneath a departing launch vehicle is clearly unsafe if the vehicle
malfunctions, and even a normal launch sheds spent stages. The location of down-
range populated areas limits the acceptable launch azimuth range for a launch
complex. Figure 3.27 shows the acceptable azimuth range for ETR and WTR.

The restrictions on launch azimuth and the latitudes of ETR and WTR control the
inclination capabilities of the United States as shown in Table 3.7. Polar orbits,
with / ^ 90 deg, can be achieved by launching south out of WTR. Polar orbits
cannot be achieved from ETR without a plane change (dog leg).
Direct orbit. Orbits are classified as direct or retrograde depending on their
direction of rotation about the central body. In a direct orbit, a spacecraft rotates
counterclockwise around the central body as viewed from the north pole; orbit
inclination is between 0 and 90 deg. (All planets are in direct orbits around the
sun.) The launch azimuth for direct orbits is 0 to 180 deg. Direct orbits are usually
achieved by launches from ETR.
Retrograde orbit. In a retrograde orbit, a spacecraft rotates clockwise around
the central body as viewed from the north pole; orbit inclination is between 90 and
180 deg. Launch azimuths for retrograde orbits are between 180 and 360 deg; the
United States can achieve retrograde orbits only by launching from WTR.

Example 3.14 Effect of Launch Azimuth
The Solar Mesosphere Explorer spacecraft was launched on a two-stage Delta
into a circular orbit with the following characteristics:
Altitude = 500 km
Inclination = 97.4 deg
Period — 94.6 min
What was the launch azimuth, and where was the launch site?
WTR is the only U.S. launch site that can achieve an inclination of 97.4 deg.
(Technically, an inclination of 97.4 deg could be achieved from ETR with a plane
change maneuver called a dog leg, but this maneuver is expensive and highly
unlikely.)
The latitude of WTR is 34.5°. The launch azimuth can be obtained by rearranging
Eq. (3.106) as follows:
cos/ cos 97.4sinAz = ——— = ———— = -0.1563cos La cos 34.5
Az = 188.99 deg
Since the inclination is greater than 90 deg the orbit is retrograde. In fact, the orbit
is sun-synchronous, a type of orbit that will be discussed in Section 3.4.
3.3.2 Orbit Perturbations
In our analysis of two-body motion, we have assumed that the mass of the
central body is spherically symmetrical and can be considered concentrated at the
geometric center. In addition, we have assumed that gravitational attraction is
the only force acting on the spacecraft. Both of these assumptions are very nearly
true, but for refined calculations it is necessary to consider the orbit perturbations
caused by forces due to 1) oblateness of the Earth, 2) drag, 3) attraction of the sun,
4) attraction of the moon, and 5) solar radiation pressure. The relative importance
of these forces is shown in Fig. 3.28. For each effect the logarithm of the disturbing
acceleration, normalized to 1 g, is plotted as a function of altitude. Earth's gravity
is the dominant acceleration at altitudes above 100 km (below 100 km, reentry
conditions prevail and atmospheric drag dominates). At altitudes below about
200 km, atmospheric drag must be considered in projecting the life of a spacecraft.
For orbits above 200 km the effects of Earth's oblateness /2 is the major force,
second only to Earth's gravity. In this section the effects of central body oblateness
on spacecraft orbits will be considered.
The Earth is not spherically symmetric. The equatorial radius is 6378.14 km and
the polar radius 6356.77 km.12 This oblateness is caused by the axial rotation rate
of the Earth. All planets share this oblateness to one degree or another. Oblateness
of the planets causes two orbital perturbations: 1) regression of nodes and 2) rota-
tion of apsides.
3.3.2.1 Regression of nodes. An equatorial bulge causes a component of
the gravitational force to be out of the orbit plane, as shown in Fig. 3.29. The out-
of-plane force causes the orbit plane to precess gyroscopically; the resulting orbital

This equation is derived by expressing the gravitational force as a polynomial, by
assuming that longitudinal variations in force can be ignored, and by observing
that /2 dominates all terms.
Table 3.8 shows J2 for the planets.12 Oblateness is large for the gaseous outer
planets, which have high rotation rates; it is small for Venus, which is almost
stationary.

eccentricity exhibit nodal regression very nearly equal to that of a circular orbit of
the same semimajor axis. As shown in Fig. 3.30, regression of nodes is greater at
low inclinations and low altitudes, where it can reach 9 deg per mean solar day.
For orbits above 10,000 km in altitude, the regression of nodes is less than 0.5 deg
per mean solar day and can be ignored for most purposes. Care must be taken,
however, in the analysis of geosynchronous orbits. Even though the regression is
small at that altitude, it is cumulative and important in planning for station keeping.
The orbit plane rotates clockwise for direct orbits and counterclockwise for
retrograde orbits. For direct orbits, regression of nodes adds to the apparent west-
ward motion caused by the rotation of the Earth.
Taking advantage of the regression of nodes makes a sun-synchronous orbit
possible. In such an orbit, regression of nodes is used to hold the orbit plane at a
constant angle with respect to the sun vector; see Section 3.4 for details.
Example 3.15 Regression of Nodes
What is the regression of nodes for the STS30, which achieved a near-circular
orbit with the following characteristics:
Periapsis altitude — 270 km
Apoapsis altitude = 279 km

The mean motion is, from Eq. (3.36),= 6652.6 km
n = V398,600.4/(6652.6)3 = 0.001164
FromTable3.8, J2 = 1.08263 x 10~3. Eccentricity, 0.00068, can be considered
to be zero. From Eq. (3.107) the regression of nodes is

d£2— = -1.5265 x 10~6 rad/s = -7.556 deg/daydt
(Correction for eccentricity would produce a regression of nodes of -7.5559
deg/day.)
3.3.2.2 Rotation of apsides. Rotation of apsides is an orbit perturbation
due to the Earth's bulge and is similar to regression of nodes (see Fig. 3.31).
Rotation of apsides is caused by a greater than normal acceleration near the equator
and subsequent overshoot at periapsis. A rotation of periapsis results. This motion
occurs only in elliptical orbits. The polynomial expansion described for Eq. (3.107)
produces the following description of the motion11'15:

apsidal rotation rate, in degrees per mean solar day, for orbits with perigee altitudes
of 200 km and various apogee altitudes and inclinations. Figure 3.32 shows that
apsidal rotation can be either positive or negative and is greater for low inclination
or low altitude orbits.

Because this is an Earth orbit, the same result could be obtained from Eq. (3.110).
It can be seen from Eq. (3.109) that when sin2 / = 4/5, apsidal rotation is zero
regardless of eccentricity. This inclination, 63.435 or 116.565 deg, is called the
critical inclination. The Molniya orbit is at the critical inclination (see Section 3.4).
Note that critical inclination is independent of /2 and therefore is the same for all
celestial bodies.

3.3.3 Ground Track
The ground track (or ground trace) of a spacecraft is the locus of nadir positions
traced on the surface of the central body by a spacecraft as a function of time.
Figure 3.33 shows the ground track of a spacecraft in a direct, circular low Earth
orbit for the first three orbits after launch from ETR.
Spacecraft ground track is the result of three motions: 1) the motion of the
spacecraft in orbit, 2) the rotation of the central body, and 3) the perturbation of
the orbit caused by the equatorial bulge of the central body. Consider a spacecraft
in orbit over the surface of a central body, as shown in Fig. 3.34.

In the figure,

Lo = longitude of spacecraft at time t
Q = longitude of ascending node at the last crossing (measured from the
prime meridian)
/ = orbit inclination
Aia — the argument of latitude (the angle in the orbital plane from the
ascending node to the spacecraft position; Aia = to + 0)
lo = longitudinal angle to spacecraft position measured in the
equatorial plane from the ascending node
t = time to travel from the ascending node to the current position, s
CD = argument of periapsis
0 = true anomaly of the current position
For a right spherical triangle,
sin La = sin i sin Aia (3.111)
sin/6> = tan La/tan i (3.112)
The argument of latitude is measured in the direction of motion and is equal to
the true anomaly plus the argument of periapsis. The maximum latitude occurs
when ALa is 90 deg and numerically equal to the orbit inclination. When ALa is 0
or 180 deg, the spacecraft position is on the equator, and the latitude is 0°. When
ALa is between 0 and 180 deg, the spacecraft is in the northern hemisphere, and
latitude is noted as north for Earth and as positive for the other planets. When ALa
is between 180 and 360 deg, latitude is noted as south for Earth and as negative
for the other planets.
The longitude of the spacecraft for a spherical nonrotating Earth would be
Lo = tt + lo (3.113)
For a rotating Earth, the spacecraft longitude must be adjusted to account for the
Earth's rotation rate of 360 deg per mean sidereal day (86,164 s). This adjustment
Re is added to western longitudes and subtracted from eastern longitudes and is
expressed as

3.3.3.1 Regression of nodes. The longitude of the spacecraft ground track
must be further adjusted to account for regression of nodes A Q. The orbit plane
rotates westward for direct orbits and eastward for retrograde orbits. For direct
orbits, regression of nodes adds to the apparent westward motion caused by the
rotation of the Earth.
3.3.3.2 Signs of adjustment. In calculating the longitude of the ground
track, it is important to keep track of the sign of each of the three adjustments
made to the longitude of the ascending node due to regression of nodes, Earth's
rotation (or apparent westward progression), and orbital motion. The signs vary
with orbit direction and hemisphere as shown in Fig. 3.35.

When using the geocentric coordinate system, the calculation of longitude can

time being sought.
Repeating the preceding steps yields a time of 299.6 s from periapsis to a true
anomaly of 20 deg; therefore, the time from the ascending node to the current
position is 674.1 s.
The argument of latitude A^ for the current position is 20 deg + 25 deg =
45 deg. From Eq. (3.111) the current latitude of the Atlantis is
sin La = (sin28.5)(sin45) = 0.3374
La = 19.72° North
The latitude is north because Aia is between 0 and 1 80 deg.
In preparation for calculating longitude, we need 1) the longitudinal angle,
2) the rotation of the Earth since passing the ascending node, and 3) the regression
of nodes since passing the ascending node.

From Eq. (3.1 12) the longitudinal angle is
sin/o = tan(19.72)/tan(28.5) = 0.660
to = 41.31°
The longitudinal adjustment for the rotation of the Earth since passing the as-
cending node is, from Eq. (3.1 14),
Re = 0.0041781(674.1) = 2.82 deg
The regression of nodes can be calculated most simply from Eq. (3.108) since
the central body is Earth:
dtt -2.06474 x 1014(cos28.5)
& (6652.64)3.5[l_ (0.000676)^
= -8.745 x 10~5 deg/s
The regression since passing the ascending node is
= (-8.745 x 10~5)(674.1) = -0.059 deg
We now have everything we need to calculate longitude. For the sake of simplicity,
we will calculate longitude in east longitude measure and convert later. From
Eq. (3.1 15) for a direct orbit, the longitude of Atlantis is
Lo = 167 + 41.31 - 0.059 - 2.82 = 205.55° east
Convert east longitude to the east-west convention used for Earth by using
Eq. (3.119):
Lo = 360 - 205.43 = 154.6° west
If we were proceeding to calculate additional positions, we would now calculate
the rotation of apsides to reposition the perigee for the next point.
3.3.4 Spacecraft Horizon
The spacecraft horizon, shown in Fig. 3.36, forms a circle on the spherical
surface of the central body. The spacecraft horizon circle encloses the area in
which the following conditions exist:
1) The spacecraft can be seen from the central body.
2) Two-way microwave communication can be established with the spacecraft
from the central body.
3) The spacecraft can observe the central body.
The line from the spacecraft to the local horizon is, at all points, perpendic-
ular to the line from the center of the central body to the horizon, as shown in
Fig. 3.37.

and measured from the nadir to the horizon
ah — the central angle, which is centered at the central body center of mass
and measured from the spacecraft horizon to the nadir vector

Note that Eqs. (3.120), (3.121), and (3.123) use the instantaneous radius to the
surface of the central body Rs, which is a function of position. For most purposes
it is adequate to substitute the mean equatorial radius RQ', however, for very precise
work (e.g., cartography) it is necessary to make adjustments for the oblateness of
the central body and for terrain roughness. Mapping spacecraft often carry radar
altimeters for this reason.
Example 3.18 Swath Width
The LANDS AT D is in a circular, near-polar Earth orbit at an altitude of 709 km.
What is the swath width when it passes over mile-high Denver, Colorado?
Spacecraft altitude, when used as an orbital element, refers to the mean equatorial
radius; therefore,
r = 6378.14 + 709 - 7087.14 km
The radius of the surface at Denver is
Rs = 1.609 + 6378.14 = 6379.75 km
From Eq. (3.120) the central angle to the spacecraft horizon is
cosc^ = 6379.75/7087.14 = 0.9002
<xh = 0.4506 rad = 25.82 deg
From Eq. (3.123), the swath width is
Sw = 2(0.4506)(6379.75) = 5749 km
How much difference would it have made if we had ignored the altitude of Denver
and used the mean equatorial radius as Rs ? The central angle would become
coscx/7 = 6387.14/7087.14 = 0.8999
ah =0.4511 rad
The swath width would be
Sw = 2(0.4511)(6378.14) = 5754 km
Assuming that Rs = RQ causes an error in swath width of about 0.1% at a surface
altitude of 5280 ft. The difference is negligible for most purposes.
3.4 Special Earth Orbits
In this section the mission designs of four important orbit types—geosynchro-
nous, sun-synchronous, Molniya, and low Earth—are analyzed.
3.4.1 Geosynchronous Orbit
A spacecraft in a circular, equatorial orbit with a period equal to one sidereal day
has a rotation rate exactly equal to the rotation rate of the Earth's surface directly
below. The spacecraft appears to be stationary as observed from Earth. This is called
a geosynchronous orbit. The north polar view of a geosynchronous orbit is shown
to scale in Fig. 3.39. Positions on this orbit are so important commercially that

they are rationed by international agreement. Most of the world's communications
satellites and meteorological satellites are positioned on this ring.
The importance of this orbit was well understood long before it could be reached.
Arthur C. Clarke emphasized what could be accomplished from such an orbit in
1945 in an essay in Wireless World.21 It was 1963, however, before launch vehicle
and electronics technology would enable the world's first geosynchronous satellite,
Syncom II. In 1964 Syncom III brought the Olympic games directly from Japan
to the United States in real time, a feat that had never before been possible.
3.4.1.1 Geosynchronous mission design. By definition, the period of a
geosynchronous orbit must be equal to the time required for the Earth to rotate
once with respect to the stars. This period is one sidereal day and is 23 h 56 min
4.09 s, or 86,164.09 s, long.
Equation (3.7) can be rearranged to yield the radius of a circular orbit given the
period
)5 (3.124)
From Eq. (3. 124) the radius of a geosynchronous orbit can be obtained as follows:
r = [(86,164.09)2 398,600.4/4jr2]^ = 42,164.17 km
h = r- RQ
h = 42,164.17 - 6378.14 = 35,786 km
Surprisingly, placing a spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit requires as much en-
ergy as launching a planetary flight. As shown in Fig. 3.40, four distinct velocity

changes are required: 1) launch to low Earth orbit, 2) Hohmann transfer from the
parking orbit to r = 42,164.2 km, 3) plane change from i =28.5 deg to the equato-
rial plane, and 4) circularization of the transfer ellipse to form the geosynchronous
orbit.
3.4.1.2 Launch to low Earth orbit. A launch to geosynchronous orbit
would be made due east out of ETR (for a U.S. spacecraft) to 1) take advantage
of the Earth's rotational velocity and 2) provide the minimum orbit inclination. In
a typical launch, the Space Shuttle accelerates the spacecraft to a 280-km circular
parking orbit. The velocity of the spacecraft in the parking orbit, from Eq. (3.6), is
V = y^Tr = ^398,600.4/6658.14 = 7.737 km/s
The launch vehicle contributes 7.329 km/s, and the rotation of the Earth contributes
408 m/s. In addition, the launch vehicle contributes the potential energy of the
spacecraft and the substantial energy that goes to gravity and drag losses.
3.4.1.3 Parking orbit to transfer ellipse. The perigee radius of the
Hohmann transfer ellipse must be tangent to the parking orbit. The apogee ra-
dius must be 42,164.2 km to match the geosynchronous orbit; thus, the semimajor
axis is 24,411.2 km. The line of apsides must be in the equatorial plane, so that
the apogee will be a point in the geosynchronous orbit. Therefore, the velocity
increase needed to change the parking orbit to the transfer ellipse must take place
on the equator. An upper stage usually performs this burn at the first equatorial
crossing. Note that two impulses are required of this stage. A single stage with
restart capability or two stages are required.
The velocity at the perigee of the transfer ellipse is, from Eq. (3.14),

The required velocity increase is
AV2 = 10.169 - 7.737 = 2.432 km/s
3.4.1.4 Plane change and circularization. A plane change is required to
rotate the transfer ellipse from an inclination of 28.5 to 0 deg. Equation (3.91)
shows that to conserve energy it is important to make the plane change at the
lowest velocity that will occur on the entire mission. The lowest velocity occurs
at the apogee of the transfer ellipse; that velocity is

Apogee velocity could also be obtained from Eq. (3.33):
rPVp = raVa
Va = rpVp/ra = 6658.14(10.169)/42,164.2
Va = 1.606 km/s
The velocity change that would be required to make a 28.5-deg plane change at
a velocity of 1.606 km/s is 0.791 km/s. Note that if the plane change were made
after circularization, the velocity change required would be 1.514 km/s. In practice,
the plane change is combined with the circularization burn because 1) less AV
is required with a combined burn and 2) a solid motor can be used for the burn
if restart is not required. The solid motor that performs this burn is often called a
kick stage.
The velocity on a geosynchronous orbit is
V = ^398,600.4/42,164.2 = 3.0747 km/s
The vector diagram for the combined maneuver is shown in Fig. 3.41. From the
law of cosines [see Eq. (3.86)], the velocity change required for the combined
maneuver is 1.831 km/s. Note that if two individual maneuvers were used, the
velocity change required would have been 2.260 km/s. It is always advantageous
to combine individual burns in this fashion; watch for plane changes that can be
combined with in-plane maneuvers.

The total velocity change required to place a spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit
is 12.0 km/s as shown here:
A Vi boost to parking orbit = 7.737
A V2 for transfer ellipse = 2.432
A1/3 and V4 plane change and circularization = 1.831
Total AV 12.000 km/s
The required total AV will vary slightly with the selection of parking orbit
altitude. If we had chosen a 180-km parking orbit altitude, the total AV would
have been 12.09 km/s. The parking orbit altitude is usually chosen to accommodate
launch vehicle constraints rather than A V considerations.
3.4.1.5 View from geosynchronous orbit. As shown in Fig. 3.42, three
spacecraft positioned on this orbit can observe the Earth's entire surface except for
the extreme polar regions. The horizon angle from a geosynchronous spacecraft
can be obtained from Eq. (3.121):
sin£ = 6378.14/42,164.17 = 0.15127
£ = 8.70deg = 0.1518 rad
The broad expanse shown in Fig. 3.42 represents a field of view of only 17.4 deg
to the spacecraft. Figure 3.39 shows why this is true.

a = 81.30deg= 1.4189 rad
The swath width is, from Eq. (3.128),
Sw = (2)(1.4189)(6378.14) = 18,100km
The horizon circles shown in Fig. 3.42 are 18,100 km across, a vast field of view.
3.4.2 Sun-Synchronous Orbit
The sun-synchronous orbit is an Earth orbit with the curious property of pro-
viding a constant sun angle for the observation of Earth. A constant sun angle is
very desirable for cameras and other instruments that observe reflected light.
A sun-synchronous orbit is designed by matching the regression of nodes to the
rotation of the Earth around the sun. For example, assume that a polar spacecraft
is launched with the orbit plane on an Earth-sun line, as shown in Fig. 3.43. As
the Earth travels around the sun, the orbit plane would depart from the sun line by
360 deg during the 365 days required to make a complete orbit. The orbit plane
would depart from the sun line at a clockwise rate of about 1 deg per day. In
90 days the orbit plane would be perpendicular to the sun line. However, suppose
we design the orbit such that its regression of nodes is equal and opposite the mean
daily motion of
360 deg/365.242 days = 0.9856 deg/day
In such a case the orbit plane would always be on a sun line. So how do we get
a regression of nodes of —0.9856 deg/day? From Eq. (3.108) it can be seen that
there is a range of orbital inclinations and altitudes that will produce the proper

orbit must be retrograde.
LANDS AT is probably the best-known sun-synchronous spacecraft. LANDS AT
D was placed in a 709-km-altitude orbit with a 98.2-deg inclination.17 Circling
the globe every 103 min, its sensors view a 185-km strip of the surface running
nearly north and south. It covers the entire surface of the Earth every 20 days. The
spacecraft crosses the equator at 9:30 a.m. local time every orbit. The spacing of
the swath is 138 km at the equator. This orbit produces a consistent and constant
lighting of the Earth, the best condition for an imaging system.
3.4.3 Molniya Orbit
The Molniya orbit, shown in Fig. 3.45, was devised by the USSR to provide
features of a geosynchronous orbit with better coverage of the northern latitudes
and without the large plane change that would be required from their far northern
launch sites. The approximate orbital elements are as follows:
P = 43,082 s (one half of a sidereal day)
a = 26562 km
/ — 63.4 deg
Viewed in Earth-fixed coordinates, the orbit rises alternately above the North
American continent and the Eurasian continent. As shown in Fig. 3.46, a
Molniya spacecraft alternates 12-h periods above each continent.
The time ticks in Fig. 3.46 show that the spacecraft spends most of its time in the
high-altitude portion of the orbit. There is an 8-h period over the North American
continent each day when Eurasia is also in view. During that period, a single
spacecraft can serve as the communication link between continents. A constellation
of three spacecraft would provide a continuous direct link. The Molniya ground

track is shown in Fig. 3.47. The orbit retraces this ground track each day. Although
it does not hover in a fixed position as a geosynchronous spacecraft would, it holds
a regional position for 8 h a day in two important regions.
A Molniya orbit requires only two impulses to become established: 1) launch
to parking orbit and 2) velocity increase at perigee to establish the ellipse.
3.4.3.1 Launch to parking orbit. A launch due east from Plesetsk, the
busiest launch site on Earth, would produce a parking orbit with an inclination of
62.8 deg. A small adjustment in azimuth will produce an inclination of 63.4 deg
and thereby eliminate rotation of apsides. The Earth's rotational assist at Plesetsk
is 200 m/s compared with 408 m/s for a launch from ETR.
The parking orbit altitude is important because, unlike the geosynchronous orbit,
the parking orbit radius becomes the perigee radius of the final orbit. The parking
orbit must be high enough to minimize drag; 300 km is an adequate altitude.
Several different perigee altitudes have been used; consider the 504-km altitude
used by Molniya 1-73.23 The velocity change for a 504-km parking orbit would
be 7.610 km/s.
3.4.3.2 Parking orbit to final orbit. The orbit period must be half of a
sidereal day, or 43,082 s. The semimajor axis, computed directly from the period,
must be 26,562 km. Any combination of apogee and perigee radii with a semimajor
axis of 26,562 km will have the correct period. The simplest design is one with
a perigee radius the same as, and tangent to, the parking orbit radius, which we
have assumed to be 6882 km. Therefore, the apogee radius must be 46,241 km.
The perigee velocity is 10.04 km/s for this orbit. The velocity increase to place a
spacecraft on this orbit is 2.43 km/s from a 504-km parking orbit.
There is no plane change or circularization required. The Molniya orbit requires
a A V of 2.43 km/s, above the parking orbit velocity, compared with 5.175 km/s

twice as much spacecraft mass in a Molniya orbit than in a geosynchronous orbit
(for a given launch vehicle—the normal situation).

3.5 Interplanetary Trajectories
Humans have been on Earth for at least 500,000 years. For most of that period
they have puzzled over the planets; for the last 40 years we have had the ability
to explore these worlds with spacecraft. Understanding interplanetary trajectories
was one of the most interesting achievements underlying that capability. This
chapter discusses how an interplanetary mission is analyzed and designed.
A brief review of the pertinent geometry of the solar system is in order.
Figure 3.48 shows an isometric view of the ecliptic plane with the nine planets in
their positions as of 1 January 1992, rotating in direct, slightly elliptical, slightly
inclined orbits around the sun. The distances involved are so enormous that two
different scales are required to accommodate all planets on one page. The semi-
major axis of the Earth's orbit is 149.597870 x 106 km,12 a distance that is called
an astronomical unit (AU). The length of an astronomical unit is shown for both
scales used in Fig. 3.48.

As shown in Table 3.10, the perihelion distances vary from 46 million km for
tiny Mercury to over 4 billion km for Neptune and Pluto. Pluto is the maverick
planet; the inclination of its orbit, 17 deg, is two and a half times greater than that
of its nearest rival, and its orbit is so eccentric (e = 0.25) that at times Neptune is
the outer planet.
The slight eccentricities of these orbits means that not only are the distances
large, but they are time variant. These eccentricities also imply that planetary
arrivals and departures must take into account flight path angles.
The planets are not quite in the ecliptic plane. The significance of the inclination
of these orbits is that a plane change at high speed must be accounted for in mission
design.
The velocities shown in Table 3.10 are the mean velocities of the planets around
the sun; since the orbits are elliptical, the velocities are time variant. The velocities
of the planets are large compared to the velocities that launch vehicles can provide.
It would not be possible to send spacecraft to the planets without taking advantage
of the orbital velocity of the Earth; the contribution of the launch vehicle is minor
in comparison.
In Table 3.10, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination are given as of
24 January 1991 (JD 244 8280.5) and refer to the mean ecliptic and equinox of
J2000.0. The orbital elements of the planets change slowly with time. For precise
work The Astronomical Almanac should be consulted.12
3.5.1 Patched Conic Approximation
A planetary trajectory is a four-body motion involving the Earth, the target
planet, the sun, and the spacecraft. It would be possible and proper to use an
TV-body simulation to study the trajectory; however, there are numerous
disadvantages in this approach. The patched conic technique is a brilliant ap-
proximation of this four-body motion; it provides adequate accuracy for almost all
purposes.
The patched conic approximation subdivides the planetary mission into three
parts (see Fig. 3.49):

spacecraft. The trajectory is an arrival hyperbola with the planet at the focus. The
influences of the sun and Earth are neglected.
An arbitrary sphere of influence is defined about the Earth and the target planet.
The transfer ellipse is "patched" to the hyperbolas at the boundaries of the spheres
of influence. The radius of the sphere of influence suggested by Laplace is3'15

where
Rs = radius of the sphere of influence of a planet
R = mean orbital radius of the planet
^planet = mass of the planet
Msun = mass of the sun
At radius Rs the gravitational attractions of the planet and the sun are approximately
equal. Other definitions of Rs are possible; specifically, an exponent of 1/3 rather
than 2/5 is sometimes used in Eq. (3.125). Fortunately, a precise definition of
sphere of influence is not critical to planetary trajectory design.
Table 3.11 shows the sphere of influence values found by using the Laplace
method. Inside the sphere of influence, spacecraft times and positions are calcul-
ated on the departure or arrival hyperbola. Outside the sphere, times and positions
are calculated on the transfer ellipse.

Technically, the transfer ellipse should be designed to terminate at the boundary
of the sphere of influence. However, the sphere of influence is so small compared
to the transfer ellipse that this small correction is negligible. For example, the true
anomaly on the transfer ellipse at Earth should be reduced by 0.15 deg to account
for Earth's sphere of influence.
It is important to remember that the actual trajectory converts smoothly from the
departure hyperbola to the transfer ellipse and back to the arrival hyperbola. None-
theless, the patched conic technique is a surprisingly accurate approximation—
accurate enough for all but the most demanding work (e.g., navigation).
3.5.2 Highly Simplified Example
To get an overview of a planetary mission, consider the simplest possible case.
Take a mission to Venus as an example, and assume the following:
1) The planetary orbits are circular. This assumption will allow the use of mean
orbital velocities without the complication of velocity variation and flight path
angles.
2) The orbits are coplanar. This assumption will eliminate plane changes.
Venus can be arbitrarily placed at arrival such that it is diametrically opposed to
the Earth position at departure, thereby eliminating the ephemeris calculations and
making the transfer ellipse tangent to the planetary orbits. The resulting trajectory
is a simple Hohmann transfer on a grand scale, as shown in Fig. 3.50. The velocities,
radii, and positions shown in Fig. 3.50 are given with respect to the sun and are
mean values assuming circular orbits.
The periapsis of the transfer ellipse is equal to the radius of the Venus orbit,
and the apoapsis radius is equal to the radius of the Earth orbit. The transfer orbit
elements can be calculated readily:
ra = 149.59 x 106 km, Va = 27.29 km/s
rp = 108.21 x 106 km, Vp = 37.73 km/s
a = 128.90 x 106 km, P = 292 days
e = 0.1605

V = 29.77 km/s
Fig. 3.50 Simplified Venus trajectory.
The spacecraft velocity at departure must be equal to the apoapsis velocity on the
transfer ellipse, or 27.29 km/s. The arrival velocity will be the periapsis velocity,
37.73 km/s. The time of flight will be half the transfer orbit period, or 146 days.
3.5.2.1 Hyperbolic excess velocity and C3. The vector difference be-
tween the velocity of the Earth with respect to the sun and the velocity required
on the transfer ellipse is called the hyperbolic excess velocity VHE (see Fig. 3.51).
The hyperbolic excess velocity is Voo on the departure hyperbola. Recall that the
velocity at infinity along a hyperbolic trajectory is the excess amount above the
escape velocity (hence the name). In Fig. 3.51,
Vss = required velocity of the spacecraft with respect to the sun on the
transfer ellipse

Jupiter, 1987 80
Ulysses, 1986 123
VHE is negative for a Venus mission or for any mission to an inner planet, indicating
that the Earth's orbital velocity must be reduced to enter the transfer ellipse.
The hyperbolic excess velocity is important because it is a measure of the energy
required from the launch vehicle system. It is traditional to use C3, which is V^E,
as the major performance parameter agreed on between the launch vehicle system
and a planetary spacecraft.
From the point of view of the spacecraft, C3 comes from a mission design
calculation as previously shown and represents the minimum energy requirement
needed to accomplish the mission. Table 3.12 shows some typical C3 requirements.
From the point of view of the launch vehicle, C3 is computed as the maximum
energy the launch vehicle can deliver carrying a spacecraft of a given weight.
Hopefully the launch vehicle C3 capability at the expected spacecraft weight will
be above the C3 required for the mission.
3.5.2.2 VOQ at the planet. When the spacecraft arrives at the target planet, a
velocity condition analogous to departure occurs. The hyperbolic excess velocity
on arrival at the planet is called V^ or VHp; we will use VOQ. VQQ is the vector
difference between the arrival velocity on the transfer ellipse and the orbital velocity
of the planet. In this example, the included angle a would be zero at arrival also;
therefore,
Voo - Vs/s - Vp/s
V^ = 37.73 - 35.05 = 2.68 km/s (3.127)
where
Vs/s = arrival velocity of the spacecraft on the transfer ellipse with respect
to the sun
Vp/s = velocity of the target planet with respect to the sun
VCQ = velocity at infinity along the arrival hyperbola
VQO at the target planet is positive in this example, indicating that velocity must
be reduced for capture.
3.5.3 Patched Conic Procedure
Consider next a realistic planetary mission with actual planetary positions and
elliptical, inclined planetary orbits. This example will use the patched conic pro-
cedure, which consists of four steps:
1) Pick a launch date and an arrival date during the launch opportunity (the
period in which the mission is possible). Accurately determine the position of the
Earth and the target planet on the chosen dates.

<<<PAGE 128>>>

116 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
2) Design a transfer ellipse from Earth to the target planet. The transfer ellipse
must contain the Earth's position at launch and the planet's position at arrival. The
time of flight on the transfer arc must be equal to the time between the launch and
arrival dates. This is a trial and error process. Each trial transfer ellipse is defined
by an arbitrary selection of the longitude of the line of apsides. Trials are made
until the transfer conditions are met.
3) Design the departure hyperbola such that it will deliver the spacecraft to the
transfer ellipse.
4) Design the approach hyperbola and the arrival mission.
Each step will be considered in terms of theory and by example in subsequent
sections. The example that will be used is the type I Venus mission in the 1988
launch opportunity.
3.5.4 Locating the Planets
In the prior simplified design, the planets were placed arbitrarily at locations that
were convenient to the calculation. Ephemeris calculations allow the determination
of actual locations for the planets at the times needed.
3.5.4.1 Launch opportunity. It is desirable for the Earth at launch and
target planet at arrival to be directly opposed, as in a Hohmann transfer, to minimize
launch energy. The years for which an approximation of this position occurs are
said to offer a launch opportunity. To see how this concept works, consider the
launch opportunities between the Earth and an imaginary planet with a period
exactly twice that of the Earth, as shown in Fig. 3.52. (This situation is similar to
that between Earth and Mars.) Assume that Earth and the target planet are perfectly
aligned for a Hohmann transfer on 1 January of year 1. In one year the Earth will
make one revolution and will be back to its original position. The period of the target
planet is two years, so that it will be halfway around the sun on arrival day. Its arrival
position will be adjacent to the Earth departure position. Initiating an interplanetary
transfer is impossible in this situation, regardless of launch vehicle capability.
At the end of the second year (1 January, year 3), the Earth has made its second
orbit of the sun. The target planet will complete its orbit of the sun on arrival day.
The planets are again in ideal positions for a mission.

where

Table 3.13 shows the synodic period of the planets. Note that the derivation of
synodic period is based on an assumption of circular orbits. The synodic period of
the outer planets is essentially one year because their orbital motion is very slow
in comparison to that of the Earth. In one year the Earth is back in a favorable
launch position, and the outer planet has not moved much.
3.5.4.3 Trajectory type and class. Planetary trajectories are classified
based on the length of the transfer ellipse (see Fig. 3.53). If the spacecraft will

travel less than a 180-deg true anomaly, the trajectory is called type I. If the space-
craft will travel more than 180 deg and less than 360 deg, the trajectory is called a
type II. Types III and IV exist but are seldom used. Trajectories are also organized
into classes. A class I transfer trajectory reaches the target planet before apoapsis
(or before periapsis for inbound missions). Class II trajectories reach the target
planet after apoapsis (or after periapsis for inbound missions). The Viking mission
to Mars, for example, used a type II, class II trajectory.
A good launch opportunity depends on more than the relative position of the
planets. The location of the line of nodes for the target planet's orbit is important
in sizing the plane change and therefore is important in setting the energy required
of the launch vehicle. Launch opportunities also vary in quality because of the
eccentricity of the orbits. Figure 3.54 shows the variation in C3 for type I and type II
trajectories to Venus over five launch opportunities. The variation shown is due to
all causes: the relative positions, the plane change, the velocities of the planets,
and the eccentricity of the orbits.
3.5.4.4 Planet locations. Strangely enough, for a planetary trajectory, the
launch and arrival dates may be arbitrarily picked; launch energy is the dependent
variable. The Voyager 1 trajectory to Jupiter was designed to launch after Voyager 2
and arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of Voyager 2.
In 1988 the launch opportunity to Venus ran from 1 March to about 10 April.
The example trajectory to Venus may be arbitrarily selected as follows:
Launch = 8 April 1988 (JD 244 7259.5)
Arrival = 26 July 1988 (JD 244 7368.5)
3.5.4.5 Ephemeris calculations. The sizes, shapes, and locations of the
planetary orbits change slowly with time; these changes are caused by perturbations
to the orbits. The changes are small but important for ephemeris calculations. To
make the situation even more interesting, the ecliptic plane moves slightly with

ORBITAL MECHANICS 119
time, as does the location of the vernal equinox vector; thus, the axis system is
moving. To accurately locate the two planets we must 1) arbitrarily fix the reference
system, 2) determine the size, shape, and location of planetary orbits in the period
of interest, and 3) hold these parameters fixed and determine the latitude and
longitude of Earth on launch day and of the target planet on arrival day.
There are two methods currently in use for fixing the axis system. One approach
is to pick a date, locate the ecliptic plane and the vernal equinox vector, and assume
that the axes are fixed for a period of time (usually 50 years). A calculation of this
kind is labeled "of epoch J2000.0" or "of epoch J 1950.0." These expressions mean
that the measurements are made from the locations of the ecliptic and the vernal
equinox vector on 1 January 2000 or 1 January 1950, respectively.
The second method of handling the moving axis system is to measure from the
instantaneous position of the ecliptic and the equinox vector. Calculations of this
type are labeled "of date."
The standard reference for ephemeris data is The Astronomical Almanac,12
available annually from the U.S. Government Printing Office. Prior to 1981 the
publication was referred to as The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac.
The Astronomical Almanac provides tabulations of the heliocentric latitude,
longitude, and radius of the planets. These tabulations were given daily for the
inner planets and at longer intervals for the outer planets. Interestingly, the Earth's
heliocentric coordinates must be calculated from the geocentric coordinates of the
sun by adding (or subtracting) 180° to the longitude and reversing the sign of the
latitude. In addition, the almanac gives the instantaneous planetary orbital elements
at 1 1 times spaced equally over a year. The instantaneous two-body elements are
known as osculating orbital elements.
Another method of obtaining ephemeris information employs the polynomial
fit technique, using short numerical series of the form
^FUTURE - £REF + Ci T + C2T2 (3.129)
where
^FUTURE = an orbital element (parameter) at some future date
= the same orbital element at a reference date in the past
Ci, €2 = polynomial coefficients
T — Julian centuries from the reference date to the future date
Given the future Julian date JDpuxuRE and the reference Julian date
T = (JDFUTURE - JDREF)/36,525 (3.130)
Polynomial coefficients of this form are given in Refs. 28 and 29.
Ephemeris data are also calculated by an alternate relation of the following form:
E = aQ + a{p + a2p2 (3.131)
The value of p is determined by using the following equation:
P = (JDFUTURE - JDREF)/2280 (3.132)
Polynomial coefficients of this type are given for all planets in Ref. 30.
The geometry of the 1988 Venus mission and the corresponding ephemeris data
are shown in Fig. 3.55, which shows a view of the ecliptic plane from the northern

less than 180 deg from Venus at arrival; therefore, this is a type I trajectory.

3.5.5 Design of the Transfer Ellipse
The transfer ellipse of this example is defined by the two following requirements:
1) It must pass through the Earth position at launch and through the Venus position
at arrival. 2) The time of flight between these positions must be exactly equal to
the number of days between 8 April 1988 and 26 July 1988. These requirements
constitute the rendezvous conditions.
The transfer ellipse can be found by trial and error. The two planet positions
define two points on a family of transfer ellipses, each defined by the radial position
of the line of apsides. Selecting the position of the line of apsides defines the true
anomaly for each planet position and the time of flight between points. The trial
and error process then becomes a series of selections of line of apsides positions
and subsequent calculations of times of flight on the resulting transfer ellipse.
The required time of flight on the transfer ellipse is the number of days between
the Julian dates of launch and arrival:
Arrival: 26 July 1988
Launch: 8 April 1988
Time of Flight:JD 244 7368.5
JD 244 7259.5
109.0 days
For the first attempt, try placing the line of apsides through the Earth position
at launch (see Fig. 3.56). The true anomaly of the Earth's position becomes
180 deg. Consulting Fig. 3.55, Venus is 132.99 deg ahead of the Earth position
(330.52 - 197.53), indicating a true anomaly of 180 + 132.99 = 312.99 deg. The
planet radii and true anomalies define the trial transfer ellipse shown in Fig. 3.56.
The eccentricity of the transfer ellipse, from Eq. (3.28), is
e =_____(108.9014 x 106) - (149.7848 x 106)_____
(149.7848 x 106)(cos 180) - (108.9014 x 106)(cos 312.99)
e = 0.1825

The first trial transfer ellipse yields a time of flight of 116.15 days vs a requirement
of 109.0 days. Subsequent trials must be made holding the following properties
on the transfer ellipse constant and varying the true anomaly at Earth and Venus:
1) radius at Earth = 149.7848 x 106 km
2) radius at Venus = 108.9014 x 106 km
3) longitudinal angle from Earth to Venus = 132.99°
Table 3.14 shows the results of three trials. Trial 3 is the transfer ellipse.
The spacecraft reaches Venus before periapsis; therefore, this is a class I trajec-
tory. The velocities required on the transfer ellipse and the associated flight path
angles can now be calculated.
Near Earth: V = 27.312 km/s, y = -3.924 deg
Near Venus: V = 37.566 km/s, y = -3.938 deg
3.5.6 Design of the Departure Trajectory
On a planetary flight, the launch vehicle sends the spacecraft off on a hyperbolic
escape trajectory. As the spacecraft speeds along, the Earth's influence diminishes
with distance and the sun's influence increases. The hyperbolic orbit gradually
becomes an elliptic orbit about the sun. To send a spacecraft to a planet, send it
away on the right hyperbolic orbit (right VOQ) and in the right plane (the transfer
plane). We can then sit back and watch physics do the rest. Like a cannon, if
we point it correctly, it will hit the target. The key results of the patched conic
calculation are the definition of the transfer plane and VQQ (i.e., how to point the
cannon). Calculation of these key results will be discussed in this section.

3.5.6. 1 Plane change. The plane change is made at departure to take ad-
vantage of the energy economy of combining the plane change with injection. In
addition, launch vehicle energy is used rather than spacecraft energy. As a result,
the transfer ellipse is not in the ecliptic plane; it is in an intersecting plane that
contains the center of mass of the sun, the Earth at launch, and Venus at arrival, as
shown in Fig. 3.57. In Fig 3.57,
it = the inclination of the transfer plane
iv = the inclination of the Venus orbital plane
a = 180 - iv = 180 - 3.394 = 176.61 deg
a,b,c = spherical angles measured on the surface of a sphere of radius re
centered at the sun
To get the inclination of the transfer plane it requires solution of the spherical
triangle a, b, c in Fig. 3.57. The side a is in the ecliptic plane and can be obtained
directly from longitudes (see Fig. 3.57):
a = 76.58 + 180 - 197.53 = 59.05 deg (3.133)
The arc b' , measured from the line of nodes to the Venus longitude can be obtained
by
b' = LV -(ft + 180)
bf = 330.52 - 76.58 - 180 = 73.94 deg (3.134)
Because longitudes are measured in the ecliptic plane, a small adjustment could
be made in b' to yield b. If the inclination of the target planet orbit is small and
preliminary design work is being done, this step can be ignored. In this example,
solving the right spherical triangle to obtain b yields b = 73.967 deg.
The arc c can be obtained using the law of cosines from spherical trigonometry:
cos c = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos a,
cosc = -0.6807 (3.135)

3.5.6.2 Calculating VHE and C3. The VHE vector is designed so that when
the spacecraft reaches "infinity" on the departure hyperbola it will have the proper
speed and direction to establish the transfer ellipse in the transfer plane. The size
of the transfer ellipse is so large compared to the hyperbolic departure orbit that,
for preliminary calculations, we do not have to find an X, Y position where the
departure (or arrival) hyperbola and the transfer ellipse are patched. As shown in
Fig. 3.58, the direction established for VHE accommodates the flight path angle of
Earth, the flight path angle of the spacecraft on the transfer ellipse, and the plane
change to the transfer plane.
In Fig. 3.58,

magnitude of each angle.

It is necessary to know a because it is the angle between the two vectors of interest
and is needed for a cosine law solution. For a right spherical triangle,
cos a — cos it cos(ye + yt)

Note: The above cosine solution step (Eq. 3.137) is a frequent source of error
in patched conic solutions. You can see from the vector diagrams, Fig. 3.58 and
Fig. 3.59, that angles ye and yc should add. This is not always the case. Sometimes
the two angles must be subtracted, as you will see at Venus arrival in this example
(Fig. 3.67). You can tell from the vector diagram if ye and yc should be added or
subtracted (the technically correct way) or you can remember the following rule
of thumb: If ye and yc have the same sign they should be subtracted; if the signs
of ye and yc differ they should be added. You can see from the vector diagrams,
Figs. 3.58 and 3.59, why this is so.

Fig. 3.60 C3 vs launch date for 1988 Venus mission.
In any year that contains a launch opportunity, there are a number of acceptable
launch dates and a number of acceptable arrival dates. Holding the arrival date of
26 July fixed, and varying the launch date, yields a series of patched conic solutions
with various times of flight and various C3 values. The result is that only certain
days in a launch opportunity are feasible for any given launch vehicle, as Fig. 3.60
shows.
In a year with a launch opportunity there will be a best day that has relative
planetary positions requiring the least launch vehicle energy. There will be a period
of a few days on either side of the best day when a mission is possible with a given
launch vehicle. For Magellan (Venus, type IV, 1989) the launch opportunity was
28 days long.
Note how rapidly C3 rises at the edges of the opportunity; substantially more
launch energy would not greatly extend the window.
It is common practice to calculate a large number of trajectories to obtain con-
tours of C3 for a range of launch dates and arrival dates. Figure 3.61 shows such
a plot for the Venus 1988 launch opportunity. Figure 3.61 shows that there are
two regions of minimum C3 in the 1988 opportunity. The upper region contains
the type II missions, and the lower region contains the type I missions. Lower C3
values could be obtained with type II missions in 1988. A C3 of 8.5 is attainable,
and time of flight (TOF) is about 200 days. The type I missions have a minimum
C3 of 12.0 and a TOF of about 100 days. The type I and II launch periods overlap;
it would be possible to launch two spacecraft at close intervals and have widely
spaced arrivals (as the Voyager program did at Jupiter). Figure 3.61 also shows
how quickly C3 increases on either side of the minimum. In just a matter of days,
a mission on any conceivable launch vehicle becomes impossible.
The launch date selected for a project is usually a compromise between C3 and
other concerns, usually arrival conditions. Thus a launch seldom takes place at the
minimum C3.

3.5.6.3 Departure hyperbola. The departure hyperbola, shown in
Fig. 3.62, has a periapsis radius equal to the radius of the parking orbit and a
VUE magnitude and direction that are calculated to place the spacecraft on the
proper transfer ellipse as previously discussed. It is convenient to visualize the
VHE vector passing through the center of the Earth. The acceptable departure hy-
perbolas form a body of revolution about the VHE vector, as shown in Fig. 3.63.
Departure on any hyperbola in the body of revolution is acceptable. The point of

injection is the location at which the spacecraft reaches the velocity needed to enter
the proper hyperbolic departure trajectory; this point is normally at the periapsis
of the hyperbola. The velocity required at the injection point is
V = (2^/rp) + VHE (3.57)
where
V = the spacecraft velocity at the point of injection into the departure
hyperbola
VHE = hyperbolic excess velocity
rp = radius at the point of injection (assumed to be at periapsis)
Although the launch vehicle interface is specified in terms of C3, the correct
velocity, as defined in Eq. (3.57), is what the launch vehicle must actually achieve.
VHE and rp define the departure hyperbola; the remaining elements can be
obtained using the relations provided in Section 3.1. For the example mission,
assuming hp = 330 km, the periapsis velocity is, from Eq. (3.57),

3.5.6.4 Launch window. The acceptable launch azimuth range at the launch
site constrains the allowable launch times to a daily launch window. Figure 3.64
shows how this works. The Earth rotates about its axis with the VHE vector passing
through its center of mass. The locus of possible injection points is a circle of
radius ft centered about the FHE vector at point A. To inject the spacecraft onto
an acceptable departure hyperbola, the launch trajectory must follow a great circle
from the launch site to point A.
Consider all of the features of the figure as fixed in space while the launch site
rotates counterclockwise around the Earth's axis on a latitude line. The daily launch
window opens at point 1 when the required launch azimuth reaches the minimum
acceptable angle for the launch site (about 35 deg for ETR; see Section 3.3).
As time passes the launch site rotates from point 1 to point 2. The required launch
azimuth increases with time until the maximum acceptable angle is exceeded at
point 2 and the window closes. The departure path shown in Fig. 3.64 assumes
that the launch is made at the instant the window opens.
Note from Fig. 3.64 that there are two opportunities to launch on some of the
departure trajectories, one early in the window and another late in the window

where the great circle crosses the launch site latitude. Also note that many of the
acceptable hyperbolas are not achievable.
The position of the FHE vector changes slowly, and as a result the length of
the launch window changes with time. The Magellan launch window varied from
28 min on the first day (28 April 1989) to 126 min on the last, or thirtieth, day.
To recap, a planetary launch can occur only in certain years, only for a few days
in those years, and only for a few minutes in those days. If the launch opportunity
is missed there will be a significant delay (one synodic period) before another
opportunity occurs. These facts are key scheduling and planning factors in any
planetary program.
3.5.7 Design of the Arrival Trajectory
There are three basic arrival mission types:
Mission
Direct impact
Gravity-assist
Planetary orbiterExample
Ranger
Voyager
Magellan
Arrival design for gravity-assist missions is dominated by targeting considerations;
arrival for orbiting missions is dominated by arrival energy considerations.
3.5.7.1 Plane change. The design of the approach hyperbola is similar to
the design of the departure hyperbola. The first step is the determination of the incli-
nation of the transfer plane with respect to the orbital plane of the target planet. This
calculation requires considering again the spherical triangle formed by the transfer
ellipse, the ecliptic plane, and the Venus orbital plane, as shown in Fig. 3.65.
The angle of interest is itp, the inclination of the transfer plane with respect to
the target planet Venus orbital plane. By the sine law of spherical trigonometry,
the following equation may be obtained:
sin itp — sin a sin a/ sin c
itp = 3.975 deg(3.139)

ture, is a dependent variable determined by the departure and transfer trajectories.
The arrival vector diagram is conceptually the same as the departure diagram, as
shown in Fig. 3.66. In Fig. 3.66,
Vp/s = velocity of the target planet with respect to the sun
Vsa = velocity of the spacecraft on the transfer ellipse, with respect to the
sun, at arrival
VOQ = spacecraft velocity at infinity on the arrival hyperbola, with respect
to the target planet
yp = flight path angle of target planet
yt = flight path angle of the spacecraft on the transfer ellipse
itp = inclination of the transfer plane, with respect to the target planet
orbital plane
Figure 3.67 shows a spherical triangle, with sides aa, itp, and (yt — yp)9 centered
on the target planet, looking into the arrival vectors Vp/s and Vs/a. The angle
between the two vectors of interest is aa. For a right spherical triangle,
(3.140) cos(yt - yp)
cos aa = cos 3.975 cos(3.938 - 0. 1280)
aa =5.5039deg
Since Vp/s = 34.80 km/s and Vs/a = 37.57 km/s, using the law of cosines yields
the following V^ for the 1988 type I Venus mission:
V^ = 4.442 km/s

solution. An actual arrival geometry will vary widely depending on the signs and
magnitudes of the angles involved.

3.5.8 Establishing Planetary Orbit
Frequently it is desired to place a spacecraft in orbit about the target planet.
Mariner 9 in 1971 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet, followed by
Viking, Pioneer 10, and Magellan. Establishing a planetary orbit requires a simple
orbit change maneuver as shown in Fig. 3.68.
The velocity at periapsis of the approach hyperbola is
The velocity at periapsis of the desired orbit is
V'P =(3.141)
(3.142)
To put a spacecraft into a planetary orbit, the velocity at periapsis must be reduced
from Vp to Vp. Substantial spacecraft energy and weight are usually required. For

example, 60% of the Magellan cruise weight was dedicated to putting the spacecraft
into Venus orbit. The velocity required to establish an orbit is proportional to
VOQ. Therefore, for an orbital mission, the optimum launch date is a compromise
between the minimum C3 and the minimum V^.
Note that for capture the velocity of the spacecraft must be reduced to a value
below A/2/x/r.
3.5.9 Gravity-Assist Maneuver
A gravity-assist maneuver is a planetary encounter designed to produce a specific
effect on the departure velocity vector of the spacecraft. When a spacecraft passes
near a planet, the spacecraft velocity vector is rotated, and the magnitude of the
velocity with respect to the sun is changed. This is a very useful maneuver because
significant changes can be made to the velocity vector without expending spacecraft
resources. After 20 years of analysis, speculation, and debate, the technique was
successfully demonstrated by Mariner 10 in 1974.31 After the flight of Mariner 10,
the maneuver became an indispensable part of planetary mission design; three of
the last four planetary missions—Voyager, Galileo, and Ulysses—would not have
been possible without it.
Figure 3.69 shows the maneuver, in planet-centered coordinates, designed for an
inside pass by the target planet (i.e., between the planet and the sun). In Fig. 3.69,

Fig. 3.70 Effect of a flyby on Voo.
Vooa = velocity at infinity on the arrival asymptote
Vood = velocity at infinity on the departure asymptote
As shown in Fig. 3.70, the effect of a planetary encounter is to add the vector
A V to the arrival velocity V^. The magnitude of the A V vector is
AV =
AV = 2V00/e(3.143)
(3.144)
The spacecraft VOQ vector is rotated through the angle 8 by the gravitational effect of
the planet. The magnitude of the V^ vector is not changed; however, the velocity
of the spacecraft with respect to the sun is changed. Recall that F^ is the velocity
of the spacecraft with respect to the planet. To obtain the velocity of the spacecraft
with respect to the sun, the velocity of the planet with respect to the sun must be
added to VQQ.
The velocity of the spacecraft with respect to the sun before and after the en-
counter is shown in Fig. 3.71. In Fig. 3.71,
Vsa = spacecraft velocity with respect to the sun on arrival at the sphere of
influence of the target planet
Vsd = spacecraft velocity with respect to the sun at departure from the
sphere of influence of the planet
Vp/s = velocity of the target planet with respect to the sun
It can be seen from Fig. 3.71 that the velocity of the spacecraft with respect to
the sun has been increased by the encounter. (In Fig. 3.71, the central portions of
vectors Vsa, Vsd, and Vp/s have been deleted, so that the area of interest may be
seen more clearly.)
The arrival vectors are fixed by the transfer trajectory design; <5, ft, AV, and Vsd
can be changed. (The arrival parameters change slightly each day of the launch
opportunity but can be considered fixed for any single day.) Selection of any
one orbital parameter defines the encounter trajectory. During design, targeting is
specified by periapsis radius or altitude; during the mission it is specified by the
target point in the B plane.

Fig. 3.71 Effect of a flyby on spacecraft velocity.
The angle aa between the velocity of the planet and the velocity of the spacecraft
is determined by the design of the transfer orbit. The angles 8 and ft are defined
by the design of the flyby hyperbola. The angle F can be calculated from the law
of sines as follows:
sinF =V,p/s(3.145)
and angle 0 = 1 80 — F — aa .

For the Venus mission example (V^ = 4.442 km/s), targeting to achieve a
periapsis altitude of 5000 km defines an encounter hyperbola with the following
elements:
Asymptote angle: ft = 5 3.25 deg
Semiminor axis: b =22,047 km
Semimajor axis: a = 16,464km
Eccentricity: e =1.6713
Periapsis velocity: Vp = 8.861 km/s
To achieve a periapsis altitude of 5000 km requires a target point in the B plane,
which is 22,047 km from the center of the planet.
From prior calculations,
Vsa = 37.57 km/s Vp/s = 34.80 km/s
ofa = 5.5039 deg V^ =4.442 km/s
The value of A V from Eq. (3.144) is
AV = 2(4.442)/1.6713 = 5.316km/s
Equation (3.145) yields
sinT = ^^ sin5.5039 = 0.75144.442
T =48.713 deg
8 = 180 - 48.713 - 5.5039 = 125.783 deg
Using the law of cosines to calculate Vsd yields
V?d = (37.57)2 + (5.316)2 - 2(199.72)cos(48.713 + 53.249)
Vsd = 39.02 km/s
The spacecraft gained 1.45 km/s in the encounter.
The departure angle, from Eq. (3.147), is
(34.80)2 + (39.Q2)2 - (4.442)2
(2)(34.80)(39.02)

3.5.9.1 Maximizing spacecraft velocity increase. The departure velocity
of the spacecraft with respect to the sun is at a maximum when Vp/s and V^ are
collinear, as shown in Fig. 3.72. In this case, the velocity of the spacecraft at
departure is the arithmetic sum of the velocity of the planet and Voo-

where 8f = the angle of turn that produces maximum spacecraft velocity at de-
parture Vsd, and j3f = the asymptote angle that produces maximum velocity at
departure.
The maximum Vsd may not be achievable; the encounter hyperbola for f$' may
require a periapsis radius lower than the surface of the target planet.
3.5.9.2 Maximum angle of turn. It is sometimes desirable to achieve a
given angle of turn rather than a velocity increase; the Ulysses mission offers an
example of this situation. The maximum theoretical angle of turn is 180 deg, which
occurs when ft = 0 and A V is a maximum. From Eq. (3.143),

The theoretical maximum angle of turn represents an elastic collision with
the target planet. The largest practical angle of turn occurs with the closest
acceptable approach to the target planet. For the Venus example, selecting a pe-
riapsis altitude of 400 km as the closest approach yields the following encounter
hyperbola:
Asymptote angle: /3 = 44.07 deg
Semiminor axis: b = 15, 940km
Semimajor axis: a = 16,464km
Eccentricity: e = 1.392
Periapsis velocity: Vp = 10.974km/s
The maximum practical turning angle for the Venus example is
amax = 180 - (2)(44.05) = 91.9 deg
The examples discussed so far show a velocity increase during the encounter;
however, the maneuver can be designed to provide a velocity increase or decrease.
3.6 Lunar Trajectories
Lunar trajectories were the premier problem in mission design in the 1960s. In
this section the characteristics of this trajectory and the techniques used will be
summarized. A patched conic method will be discussed; however, the method is not
as accurate for lunar trajectories as planetary ones because of the influence of both
the Earth and sun. Accurate solutions must be accomplished by numerical analysis.
3.6.1 Motion of the Earth-Moon System
The Earth-moon system is unique; the two bodies are so close to the same mass
that, had the moon been slightly larger, they would be the only known binary planet
system. It is a common misconception that the moon revolves around the Earth. In
fact, the Earth and moon revolve around a common center of mass that is 4671 km
from the center of the Earth and 379,729 km from the center of the moon; see
Fig. 3.73. One sidereal rotation about the common center takes 27.32 days.
Solar perturbations change the rotation period by as much as 7 h. The orbit is
slightly elliptical with an eccentricity of 0.0549 and semimajor axis of 384,400 km.
As a result the Earth-moon distance changes slightly with true anomaly. In addition
the semimajor axis is increasing with time as the tides about Earth take energy
from the moon orbit and slow its orbital velocity. Small changes in eccentricity
occur with a period of 31.8 days; this effect is called evection and was observed
by the Greeks 2000 years ago.3
The average orbit inclination, with respect to the ecliptic, is 5.145 ±0.15 deg
varying with a period of 173 days.36 The inclination of the equatorial plane with
the ecliptic is 23.45 deg and the equatorial plane is relatively stable with a period
of 26,000 years. When the ascending node of the Earth-moon orbit is aligned
with the vernal equinox, the inclination of the moon orbit with the equator is at a
maximum of 23.45 + 5.145 or 28.6 deg. Conversely, when the descending node is

at the equinox, the inclination of the moon orbit with the equator is 18.3 deg. The
period of this variation is 18.6 years. Recall that the minimum inclination that can
be achieved from ETR without a plane change is 28.5 deg; therefore, good launch
years are on 18.6 year centers. It is not a coincidence that the moon launches in
1969 were during a good year.
3.6.2 Time of Flight and Injection Velocity
Time of flight was a very serious consideration in the Apollo manned missions
because of the mass of provisions required to sustain life. Injection velocity is a
serious consideration in any mission because the chosen launch vehicle imposes
an absolute limit. Lunar time of flight and injection velocity can be bounded using
a simplified case with the following assumptions:
1) The lunar orbit has a circular radius of 384,400 km.
2) The transfer ellipse is in the lunar orbit plane.
3) The gravitational effect of the moon is negligible.
4) The injection point is at the perigee of the transfer ellipse.
Unlike planetary launches, a lunar departure orbit is elliptical rather than hyper-
bolic. The minimum energy trajectory is an ellipse just tangent to the lunar orbit,
orbit 1 in Fig. 3.74. Any less energetic orbit would not reach the lunar radius. The
minimum energy trajectory has the longest possible transfer time and the lowest
injection velocity. Assuming a transfer ellipse with perigee of 275 km, the nominal
shuttle orbit, produces a minimum energy transfer ellipse with a time of flight of
119.5 h and an injection speed of 10.853 km/s.
Shorter flight times can be obtained by increasing the injection speed, orbits
2 and 3 in Fig. 3.74. Figure 3.75 shows the relation between time of flight and

injection speed for injection altitudes of 275 km. You can see that the 72-h time
of flight used in the Apollo program is a reasonable compromise between time
and launch vehicle energy. A curve similar to Fig. 3.76 can be constructed for any
chosen injection altitude.
3.6.3 Sphere of Influence
In the patched conic analysis of a planetary mission, it was possible and accurate
to assume that the sphere of influence was negligibly small compared with the
transfer ellipse, and essentially to ignore it. That assumption is not accurate for a
lunar trajectory; it is necessary to acknowledge the sphere of influence and make
a trajectory patch at its boundary.

3.6.4 Lunar Patched Conic
Using the patched conic method for a moon mission is not as accurate as it is for
a planetary mission, primarily because of the influence of the sun on both bodies
and the short distance between the two, compared with the sphere of influence.
In the following analysis, we will assume that the lunar transfer orbit is coplanar
with the lunar orbit. The mission is shown schematically in Fig. 3.76.
3.6.4.1 Designing a lunar mission. The procedure for designing a lunar
mission is as follows:
1) Set initial conditions. To define the transfer ellipse, it is necessary to pick
injection altitude (or radius), velocity, and flight path angle. (If injection is made
at perigee the flight path angle is zero.) In addition, it is necessary to define the
location of the arrival point at the sphere of influence; the most convenient method
is to set the angle A,, as shown in Fig. 3.76.
2) Define the transfer ellipse given r, V, and y at the point of injection using
the energy/momentum technique described in Section 3.1.2 and Example 3.2. If
the initial velocity is not high enough, the departure ellipse will not intersect the
moon sphere of influence and a second set of initial conditions must be chosen.

142 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
Note that the departure trajectory is an ellipse rather than a hyperbola as it was
in a planetary mission. A lunar mission can be done without reaching the escape
velocity.
3) Find the radius to the sphere of influence, r\ in Fig. 3.76, from trigonometry.
4) Given r\, find time of flight to the sphere of influence boundary.
5) Define V2, and yi inside the sphere of influence at the arrival point. The radius
is the radius of the sphere of influence, 66,183 km.
6) Given r2, V2, and y2 inside the sphere of influence, define the arrival orbit.
(It is not reasonable to assume that the sphere of influence will be pierced at VOQ
on the arrival hyperbola as it is with a planetary mission.)
7) If the arrival orbit is satisfactory, find the launch day using the time of flight
calculated in step 3 and average orbital velocity.
8) If the arrival orbit is not satisfactory (e.g., if the arrival hyperbola impacts the
surface when a lunar orbit was desired), adjust initial conditions and start over at
step 1.

Assume the lunar orbit is circular with radius 384,400 km and is coplanar with
the transfer ellipse. Define a lunar trajectory with the following initial conditions:

You can use Eq. (3.14) to assure yourself that the calculated semimajor axis and a
periapsis velocity of 10.88 km/s are consistent.
Arrival conditions. Defining arrival as the point on the transfer ellipse at the
intersection with the sphere of influence, the radius of the arrival point is r\ in
Fig. 3.76. The radius r\ can be obtained from trigonometry, specifically the cosine
law. The full solution of the triangle containing r\ is shown in Fig. 3.77. The phase
angle 0i is 9.2662deg and r\ is 355,953 km. Given n, the arrival velocity V\, the
flight path angle y\, the true anomaly 9\, and the time of flight can be determined
by evaluating parameters at a point. The technique is described in Section 3.1.3
and Example 3.5.
The parameters at a point evaluation yields V\ = 1.276 km/s, y\ = 80.766 deg,
0i = 166.54 deg, and time of flight = 49.752 h.
Defining the lunar orbit. The lunar orbit, inside the sphere of influence, is
defined by the radius, velocity, and flight path angle. The average velocity of the
moon about the Earth-moon center of mass is Vm = 1.023 km/s in a counterclock-
wise direction perpendicular to the Earth-moon radius. The arrival geometry is
shown in Fig. 3.78; note that the angle between the known velocity vectors Vm and
V\ is]/j -0!.
The spacecraft velocity, with respect to the moon V29 can be obtained from the
cosine law; the full solution of the vector diagram is shown in Fig. 3.79. You can see
from Fig. 3.78, the arrival geometry, that the flight path angle associated with V2 is
y2 = 180-A-^
y2 = 57.05 deg
The orbital elements inside the sphere of influence are determined:

The lunar orbit can now be defined using the energy/momentum technique.
(It is not adequate to assume that the spacecraft arrives at Voo on a hyperbolic orbit,
as is done in planetary trajectories, because the sphere of influence is relatively
small.) From Eq. (3.8), the specific energy of the lunar orbit is
_ (1.359)2 4902.8
£ ~ 2 " 66183
8 = 0.84936 km2/s2
(You will recognize that JJL for the moon is 4902.8.) A positive specific energy
signals a hyperbolic orbit. Calculating specific momentum,
H = (66183)(1.359) cos(57.05)
H = 48,920.5 km3/s
and from Eq. (3.10)
(2)(0.84936)
From Eq. (3.15),a = -
4902.8 (3.10)= -2886.2km
(3.15)
(4892°'5)2 = 13.0432(4902.8)(-2886.2)
A negative semimajor axis and an eccentricity larger than one both confirm the
orbit as hyperbolic.
The resulting lunar orbit is the relatively flat hyperbola shown to scale in
Fig. 3.80. The periapsis radius is 34,759 km and the time of flight from sphere of
influence to periapsis is 11.59 h, making the total time of flight from injection to
periapsis 61.34 h. Note that V^ is 1.3033 km/s, while velocity at the patch point is
1.39 km/s. The common planetary trajectory assumption that velocity at the patch
point is Voo would have led to a serious error.
Recall the initial assumption that the trajectory was in the lunar orbit plane. If
a noncoplanar trajectory is desired, the inclination of the transfer plane can be
incorporated into the calculations using the methods described in Section 3.5.
3.6.4.2 Evaluation of the orbit. With the lunar trajectory elements in hand,
evaluate the orbit against what is needed for the mission. For example, if a lunar

landing were desired, this is clearly the wrong orbit. If the orbit is not satisfactory,
change the initial conditions, particularly A, and recalculate.
3.6.4.3 Phasing. After a satisfactory lunar orbit is found, the phasing of the
lunar position at injection can be determined. The time of flight from injection to
the sphere of influence is 49.752 h. The average lunar angular speed is 13.177 deg
per day; therefore, the moon, at the time of injection, must be 27.3 deg before its
position at spacecraft arrival (see Fig. 3.81).
It is worth repeating that a patched conic analysis of a lunar trajectory is for
preliminary design only. For accurate work, a numerical analysis is required.

Propulsion
4.1 Introduction
Konastantin Eduardovich Tsiolkowski, a Russian mathematics professor, was
the first to observe that rocket propulsion was a prerequisite for space exploration.
As early as 1883, Tsiolkowski noted that gas expulsion could create thrust; thus, a
rocket could operate in a vacuum. In 1903 he published a milestone paper describ-
ing how space flight could be accomplished with rockets. He advocated the use
of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants. He described staged rockets
and showed mathematically that space exploration would require staging. Every
time you use Eq. (4.19), think of Tsiolkowski.
Robert H. Goddard, professor of physics at Clark University, also observed that
space flight would require liquid rocket propulsion. With this goal he was the first
to design, build, and fly a liquid rocket, a feat that required over 200 patented
inventions and his entire life. He flew the first liquid rocket in 1926. Using liquid
oxygen and gasoline, it flew for 2.5 s, reaching an altitude of 41 ft and a speed of
63 mph. He developed pump-fed engines, clustered stages, quick disconnects,
pressurization systems, and gyro stabilization. By the time he died in 1945, he
had developed every type of equipment that would be required for a vehicle like
the Saturn V. His rockets had reached a size of 2200 N (500 Ib) and had reached
altitudes of 1.9 km (2 miles).
Goddard's work was largely forgotten in the United States. Germany how-
ever followed his work closely and vigorously developed propulsion systems as
weapons. After World War II the German technology was brought to the United
States (ironically) and Russia, where it was developed to its current state.
4.1.1 Units
A word about units: All of the development work done in the United States
was done in the English system of units. The conversion to the SI units is most
particularly trying in propulsion. As you probably know, this conversion difficulty
contributed to the loss of a planetary spacecraft in 1999. Table 4.1 summarizes the
most frequently used conversion factors. In this section SI units will be shown first
and English units following in parentheses.
4.1.2 Arrangement of Chapter 4
The fundamentals of propulsion are described in Section 4.2. Section 4.3 de-
scribes how the performance requirements of a propulsion system are derived.
Sections 4.4-4.7 describe the considerations peculiar to each of the most common
types of spacecraft propulsion systems. Monopropellant systems are described
first. Equipment common to each system (for example, tankage) are discussed in

4.2 Theoretical Rocket Performance
A rocket generates thrust by accelerating a high-pressure gas to supersonic
velocities in a converging-diverging nozzle. In most cases the high-pressure gas is
generated by high-temperature combustion of propellants. As shown in Fig. 4.1, a
rocket, of any type, consists of a combustion chamber, throat, and nozzle.
In a bipropellant rocket engine the gases are generated by the rapid combustion
of a liquid oxidizer and liquid fuel in the combustion chamber, for example, liquid
hydrogen, and liquid oxygen. In a monopropellant system only one propellant is
used. High-pressure, high-temperature gases are generated by decomposition of a
single propellant. Hydrazine is the most common monopropellant. In a solid system
a solid fuel and oxidizer are mechanically mixed and cast as a solid-propellant
grain. The grain occupies most of the volume of the combustion chamber. In a
cold-gas system there is no combustion involved. A gas, like helium, is stored at
high pressure and injected into the chamber without combustion.
4.2.1 Thrust
Rocket thrust is generated by momentum exchange between the exhaust and
the vehicle and by the pressure imbalance at the nozzle exit. The thrust caused by

momentum exchange can be derived from Newton's second law:
Fm = ma
Fm=mp(Ve-VQ)(4.1)
(4.2)
where Fm is the thrust generated as a result of momentum exchange, N, (Ib);
a the acceleration, m/s2 (ft/s2); mp the mass flow rate of propellants flowing into
the chamber or mass of the exhaust gas, kg/s (Ibm/s); Ve the average velocity
of the exhaust gas, m/s (fps); and VQ the initial velocity of the gases, m/s (fps).
Because the initial velocity of the gases is essentially zero. Equations (4.1) and
(4.2) assume that the velocity of the exhaust gas acts along the nozzle centerline.
Example 4.1 Thrust from Momentum
A man is standing in a row boat throwing bricks out the back. The bricks weigh
1 kg each, and he can throw them at a rate of six bricks per minute with a consistent
speed of 10 m/s. If this process is frictionless, how much thrust does he generate?
From Eq. (4.2)

In addition to the thrust caused by momentum, thrust is generated by a pressure-

Pa the ambient static pressure, Pa (psia). Because the total thrust on the vehicle
is the sum of the thrust caused by momentum exchange and thrust caused by exit
plane pressure, the fundamental relationship for thrust becomes
F = -Pa)Ae (4.6)
For any given engine, thrust is greater in a vacuum than at sea level by an amount
equal to Peae. A rocket is the only engine that will operate in a vacuum, and it is
also substantially more efficient in a vacuum, as shown in Fig. 4.2.
For engines that must operate in atmosphere, for example, launch vehicle en-
gines, the diverging section of the nozzle is designed so that Pe = Pa at design
point. This is called optimum expansion and provides best performance for launch
vehicle engines. For optimum expansion to occur in a vacuum engine would require
an infinite area ratio and an infinitely long nozzle.
4.2.2 Ideal Rocket Thermodynamics
By somewhat idealizing the flow in a rocket engine, thermodynamics can be
used to predict rocket performance parameters to within a few percent of mea-
sured values. The following seven assumptions define what is known as theoretical
performance:
1) The propellant gases are homogeneous and invariant in composition through-
out the nozzle. This condition requires good mixing and rapid completion of com-
bustion and, in the case of solids, homogeneous grain. Good design will provide
these conditions.
2) The propellant gases follow the perfect gas laws. The high temperature of
rocket exhaust is above vapor conditions, and these gases approach perfect gas
behavior.
3) There is no friction at the nozzle walls, therefore, no boundary layer.
4) There is no heat transfer across the nozzle wall.
5) Flow is steady and constant.
6) All gases leave the engine with an axial velocity.
7) The gas velocity is uniform across any section normal to the nozzle axis.
Assumptions 3, 4, 6, and 7 permit the use of one-dimensional isentropic expan-
sion relations. Assumption 1 defines what is called frozen equilibrium conditions.
The gas composition can be allowed to vary from section to section in what is
called a shifting equilibrium calculation. The shifting equilibrium calculation ac-
counts for exothermic recombinations, which occur in the exhaust stream; higher

propellant performance results. With these assumptions theoretical rocket engine
performance parameters can be calculated, as well as measured, and the results
compared.
4.2.2.1 Specific impulse lsp. Specific impulse describes how much thrust
is delivered by an engine per unit propellant mass flow rate. It is the premier
measurement of rocket performance. The utility of the parameter was recognized
at least as early as Goddard's work. During the postwar development of launch
vehicles in the United States, it was common to assume that an extra second of
specific impulse was worth a million dollars in engine development. 7sp is the
conventional method of comparing propellants, propellant combinations, and the
efficiency of rocket engines. In the English system of units it is
F
/sp=Tm(4.7)
where 7sp is the specific impulse, s; F the thrust, Ibf; and m the propellant mass
flow rate, Ibm/s.
In the English system, pounds mass and pounds force are allowed to cancel, and
7sp is measured, conveniently, in seconds. In very careful work you will sometimes
see Ibf-s/lbm. In the SI system mass is in kilograms, and force is in newtons or
kilograms-meters/second. In equations with SI units, it is necessary to multiply
7sp in seconds times the SI gravitational constant, 9.80665. Almost all published
material, even British material, still reports 7sp in seconds, and this chapter will
follow that custom. However, the student needs to be careful in the use of 7sp and
note when it should be multiplied by gc. With force and flow rate in SI units and
7sp in seconds, Eq. (4.7) becomes

Adjusting Eq. (4.8) for SI units produces
(4.9)
Equations (4.8) and (4.9) show that 7sp is a thermodynamic property of the propel-
lants, approximately proportional to *JTC/M. The left term in Eq. (4.9) is dominant.
The effect of chamber pressure is second order; therefore, spacecraft engines can
and do have low chamber pressures compared to their sea-level counterparts.
To fully define specific impulse, it is necessary to state 1) ambient pressure,
2) chamber pressure, 3) area ratio, 4) shifting or frozen equilibrium conditions,
and 5) real or theoretical. Specific impulse calculated from Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9)
is theoretical, frozen equilibrium and vacuum conditions; chamber pressure and
area ratio can be anything you wish. If gas composition is allowed to vary in the
nozzle, shifting equilibrium conditions prevail, and a slightly higher 7sp results. A
real engine can be expected to have a specific impulse about 93% of theoretical.
Figure 4.3 compares the theoretical, vacuum, frozen equilibrium 7sp of nine
propellant combinations at a chamber pressure of 500 psia and an area ratio of 50.
Fluorine is the most energetic oxidizer ever tested; however, it is very difficult
to contain because it reacts vigorously with tank materials. The use of fluorine
never progressed beyond research. Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen are the
Space Shuttle propellants. They are difficult to handle because they are cryogenics,
boiling point 90° K and 20° K respectively, but the 7sp obtainable makes them the
best performing practical propellants. The nitrogen tetroxide propellant combi-
nations shown are called storable because they are liquids at room temperatures.
These propellants are used on the Titan family of launch vehicles and on spacecraft.
Monopropellant hydrazine is another popular spacecraft propellant because it is
a monopropellant; it can be spontaneously decomposed, without an oxidizer, to
yield hot propulsion gases. Thermodynamic properties of combustion gases from

some propellant combinations are shown in Table 4.2. Note in Table 4.2 the high-
combustion gas temperatures for bipropellant combinations. It is clear why cooling
is a key problem in rocket engine design from Goddard's time to today. One of
the advantages of monopropellants is that radiative cooling techniques can be
used.

e = Ae/At (4.10)
where e is the area ratio; Ae the exit area measured hot; and At the throat area
measured hot. Area ratio is a measure of the gas expansion provided by an engine.
Optimum area ratio provides an exit-plane pressure equal to local ambient pressure.
For a sea-level or first-stage engine the optimum area ratio is selected near midpoint
of the flight; an area ratio around 12 is common. For a spacecraft engine (or an
upper-stage engine) the optimum area ratio is infinite; the largest area ratio allowed
by space and weight is used. An area ratio in the range 50 to 100 is common for
spacecraft engines.

4.2.2.4 Thrust coefficient Cf. Thrust coefficient is a useful term which first
arose during rocket engine testing. It is the proportionality constant between thrust
and the product of chamber pressure and throat area:
F = PcA,Cf (4.12)
where Pc is the chamber pressure, Pa (psia); At the area of the nozzle throat when
hot, m2 (in.2); and Cf the thrust coefficient. An engine without a diverging section
would have a thrust coefficient of 1; thus, the coefficient is always larger than 1. The
improvement in thrust provided by the nozzle is characterized by thrust coefficient.

Figure 4.5 shows theoretical C/ as a function of k and area ratio for vacuum
conditions. In practice, about 98% of theoretical C/ is achieved in steady-state
performance.
4.2.2.5 Total impulse I. Impulse is defined as a change in momentum
caused by a force acting over time, for constant thrust,
I = Ft (4.14)
where / is the total impulse delivered to the spacecraft, N-s (Ibf-s); F the thrust,
N (Ibf); and t the burn time (time of application of F), s.
Equation (4.14) assumes that thrust is a constant with time, which is usually true
for liquid engines. For cases where thrust is not constant, as in solid rockets, total
impulse can be computed by integrating for the area under the thrust-time curve
or from Eq. (4.15), which is independent of thrust.
(4.15)
where wp is the total weight of propellant consumed in kilograms and gc is the
gravitational constant. Propulsion system size is rated based on total impulse; this
is a particularly useful measure of solid rocket motor systems, although it is used
for all types of propulsion systems.
4.2.2.6 Mixture ratio (MR). Mixture ratio is an important parameter for
bipropellant systems. It is the ratio of oxidizer to fuel flow rate, on a weight basis,
MR=^ (4.16)wf
where w0 is the oxidizer mass flow rate, kg/s (Ib/s) and Wf the fuel mass flow rate,
kg/s (Ib/s). Volumetric mixture ratio is sometimes used in conjunction with tank
sizing; mixture ratio can be converted to volumetric mixture ratio as follows:
^- (4.17)

<<<PAGE 173>>>

PROPULSION 161
where p/ is the density of the fuel, kg/m3 (lb/ft3) and p0 the density of the oxidizer,
kg/m3 (lb/ft3).
The volumetric mixture ratio, consumed by the engine, has a major effect on
system design because it determines the relative sizes of the propellant tanks.
In a spacecraft design the loaded mixture ratio is sometimes designed off opti-
mum in order to have both oxidizer and fuel tanks the same volume. The 7sp loss
is slight, and two identical tanks are cheaper than two individually sized tanks.
(By convention, mixture ratio is always by mass unless volume is specified.)
4.2.2.7 Bulk density. It is often convenient to use the bulk density of a
propellant combination to expedite approximate calculation. Bulk density is the
mass of a unit volume of a propellant combination "mixed" at the appropriate
mixture ratio. Bulk density can be computed as follows:
MR+lPb = ————T—— (4.18)MR/po -f l/pf
where pb is the bulk density of a propellant combination in the same units as p0
and p/, usually in kilograms/cubic meters.
4.3 Propulsion Requirements
There are three major activities involved in setting the requirements for a space-
craft propulsion system. The first decision, and the one which has the most far
reaching impact, is the selection of propulsion system type. This choice is de-
scribed in Section 4.3.1. Secondarily, the translational and rotational thrust lev-
els and propellant allocations are determined. These activities are discussed in
Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.
4.3.1 Propulsion System Types
Current propulsion technology provides five basically different, widely used,
propulsion choices: cold-gas systems, solid motor systems, monopropellant sys-
tems, bipropellant systems, and dual-mode systems; each has its niche in spacecraft
design. The selection of propulsion system type has substantial impact on the total
spacecraft and is a key selection in early design.
There are two other system types, which are feasible and are beginning to be
used. These are the following: ion propulsion, which received an exhaustive flight
demonstration on Deep Space 1, and Hall effect thrusters, which were extensively
used by the former USSR and are now being used on U.S. spacecraft. Both of these
new systems are for low thrust applications.
4.3.1.1 Cold-gas systems. Almost all of the spacecraft of the 1960s used
this system (see Fig. 4.4). It is the simplest choice and the least expensive.
Cold-gas systems can provide multiple restarts and pulsing. The major disad-
vantage of the system is low specific impulse (about 40 s) and low thrust lev-
els (less than a newton) with resultant high weight for all but low total impulse
missions.

4.3. 1.2 Monopropellant systems. Figure 4.5 is the next step up in com-
plexity and cost. Monopropellant systems can supply pulsing or steady-state thrust.
The specific impulse is about 225 s, and thrusts from 0.5 to several hundred newtons
are available. The system is a common choice for attitude control and midrange
impulse requirements. The only monopropellant in flight use is hydrazine
4.3.1.3 Bipropellant systems. Figure 4.6 is the top of the complexity
and expense scale; however, it is a very versatile and high performance system.
Bipropellants provide an 7sp of about 310s and a wide range of thrust capability
(from a few pounds to many thousands of pounds). They can be used in puls-
ing or steady-state modes. The most common propellants for spacecraft use are
nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine. Bipropellant systems are not as
common as monopropellants because high total impulse with restart is not usually
required.
4.3.1.4 Dual-mode systems. Figure 4.7 shows the dual-mode system, a
new arrangement specifically designed for situations that require high-impulse
burns in addition to low-impulse attitude control pulses. High-performance high-
impulse burns are provided by a bipropellant nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine system.
The bipropellant fuel, hydrazine, is also used as a monopropellant for low-impulse
attitude control pulses. This system type is ideal for geosynchronous satellites,
which require a final high-impulse burn to achieve geosynchronous orbit and
require low-impulse attitude control and stationkeeping. Planetary spacecraft,

which require an orbit insertion burn as well as attitude control, is another mission
for which this system has advantages.
4.3.1.5 Solid motor systems. Solid motor systems (see Fig. 4.8) are can-
didates when all of the impulse is to be delivered in a single burn and the impulse
can be accurately calculated in advance (shutdown/restart is not current state of
the art for solids). Examples of situations of this type are planetary orbit insertion
and geosynchronous apogee burns (apogee kick motors). If the single burn criteria
are met, solids provide simplicity and reasonable performance (specific impulse
about 290 s).
Table 4.3 compares the capabilities of each type of propulsion system and the
missions for which they are suited. The impulse ranges and specific impulses listed
in Table 4.3 are approximate. Solid shutdown-on-command has been demonstrated
as has bipropellant pulsing. Neither process is common in spacecraft design.
As you can see from Table 4.3, monopropellants offer wide versatility at medium
performance, which explains their wide use. Bipropellant systems offer the same

flexibility at high performance and highest complexity and cost. Planetary mis-
sions are now using dual-mode systems to provide high-performance bipropellant
translation burns for tasks like orbit insertion and monopropellants for rotational
attitude control. These systems use hydrazine as a monopropellant and as a bipro-
pellant fuel with nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.
Solid systems are relatively inflexible; their greatest utility is for situations in
which the required impulse is accurately known years before launch, at the time the
motor is poured. They give good performance at reduced complexity. The motor
itself is simple; however, in addition to the motor you must provide thrust vector
control, ignition, and safe/arm.
Cold-gas systems are a clear choice for low performance, low total impulse, and
inexpensive simplicity.
The propulsion system also includes any pyrotechnic devices used by the space-
craft. A typical list of pyrotechnic functions is as follows: 1) upper-stage separation;
2) release of deploy able equipment such as solar panels, antennas, scan platforms;
3) solid rocket motor ignition; 4) solid motor jettison; and 5) pyro valve operation.
Propulsion is the only method of applying an external force to a spacecraft.
Aside from the launch of a spacecraft, which requires a great deal of propulsion,
there are two functions that require propulsion. These are as follows: 1) transla-
tional velocity changes, typically to change orbits (the source of these require-
ments is from "Orbital Mechanics," Chapter 3); and 2) rotational velocity changes
for rotational maneuvers, typically to change rotation rate, attitude, or pointing
direction. (The source of these requirements is the attitude control system; see
Chapter 5.)

and maneuvers of each type.
4.3.2 Translational Velocity Change
One of the main products of the mission design is a statement of the A V required
for the maneuvers required for the mission. To convert these velocity change
requirements to propellant requirements, we need the Tsiolkowski equation and
its corollaries. Tsiolkowski published these equations in 1 895, before the invention
of the automobile or the airplane, much less the invention of spacecraft:

1 66 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
The assumptions implicit in Eq. (4.19-4.21) are as follows:
1) Thrust is the only unbalanced force on the vehicle, that is, force of gravity
balanced by centrifugal force and drag is zero. (The equations are not valid for
launch vehicle first-stage operation in atmosphere.).
2) Thrust is tangential to vehicle trajectory (aligned with instantaneous vehicle
velocity).
3) The exhaust gas velocity is constant, which implies a fixed nozzle throat area
and sonic velocity at the throat. The throat area of a solid motor may vary with
ablation; however, this error is usually small.
All rocket engines are sonic at the throat; this condition occurs at a relatively
low pressure ratio. Equations (4.19-4.21) are particularly important because they
yield the propellant mass required for a spacecraft of a given mass to perform a
given A V maneuver. You should add Eqs. (4.19-4.21) to your life list of equations
you remember.
4.3.2. 1 Derivation of Tsiolkowski equation [Eq. (4. 19)]. It is worth a
moment to see how Tsiolkowski derived his important equations. From the pre-
ceding assumptions thrust on the spacecraft is exactly equal to the force generated
by the exiting exhaust gas and opposite in sign. Therefore, the force on the vehicle
(thrust F) is equal to the mass of the vehicle m times the acceleration of the vehicle
dv F = m —dt
where V is the velocity of the spacecraft and m the mass of the spacecraft. Thrust is
also equal to the time rate of change of momentum, or the exhaust gas velocity — V e,
times the time rate of change of mass dm/dt ,
Equating the two expressions for thrust,

where gc is the gravity constant, 32.1740 ft/s2 or 9.8066 m/s2. Mass ratio is inde-
pendent of unit system. Equations (4.20) and (4.21) are algebraic manipulations
of Eq. (4.19).
Example 4.2 Translational Velocity Requirement
The geosynchronous orbit provides a very common example of translational
velocity requirements derived from orbital mechanics. The geosynchronous orbit
is obtained by first placing a spacecraft on a low Earth parking orbit. Typically,
an upper stage of the launch vehicle then places the spacecraft in an elliptical
transfer orbit tangent to the parking orbit with apogee at geosynchronous altitude,
35,786 km. It is a spacecraft task to circularize the transfer orbit and to change the
orbit plane from the transfer inclination, 28.5 deg for a U.S. launch, to zero incli-
nation. Plane change and circularization requires a velocity increase of 1.831 km/s
for a U.S. launch (see Ref. 5, pp. 81-87 for details).
A solid rocket motor, called an apogee kick motor (AKM), is a common choice
for this task. Such a motor would typically deliver an 7sp of 290 s. How much
propellant is required for this maneuver if the spacecraft weighs 2000 Ib at burn out,
including AKM inert weight? Equation (4.20) provides for this situation (solving
first in English units).
Converting kilometers/second to feet/second,
AV = 1.831 km/s (3280.84) = 6007.2 ft/s

L \5c*sp/ J

mp = 2000 [0.90375] = 1807.5 Ib propellant
The propellant weight required for this maneuver is 1807.5 Ib. Therefore, the
spacecraft launch weight is 3807.5 Ib. The importance of high specific impulse is
evident.
Repeating the same calculation in SI units, m f = 907 kg:
mp = 819.88 kg = 1807.5 Ib propellant
4.3.2.2 Finite bum losses. Mission design calculations assume that ve-
locity is changed at a point on the trajectory, that is, that the velocity change is
instantaneous. If this assumption is not valid, serious energy losses can occur.
These losses, called finite burn losses,5 are caused by the rotation of the spacecraft
velocity vector during the burn, as shown in Fig. 4.9.

Fig. 4.9 Velocity change during finite burn.
In Fig. 4.9 it is assumed that the thrust vector is held inertially fixed during the
burn and oversimplifies the case in two respects:
1) The orbit at the end of burn is not the same orbit as the start of the burn. The
orbit may not even be the same type; the initial orbit might be a circle and the final
orbit an ellipse. The orbital elements are continually changing during the burn.
2) If the final orbit in Fig. 4.9 were an ellipse, 0 would be increased by the
amount of the final flight-path angle. In reality, there will be a continuous change
in flight-path angle as a function of time.
Also note that the change in spacecraft velocity is not linear with time [see
Eq. (4.19)]; acceleration is much larger at the end of the burn because the spacecraft
is lighter.
The finite burn losses can be a significant percentage of the maneuver energy.

of thrust-to-weight ratio.

Figure 4.10 is not general; each suspect situation requires a numerical integration
to evalual/e accurately. Low thrust-to-weight ratios are to be avoided; situations
where thrust to weight is less than about 0.5 should be analyzed. Finite burn losses
can be avoided by steering to hold the thrust vector on the spacecraft velocity vector;
losses are reduced to the error in steering. The trade is a saving of propellant mass
vs increased complexity in the attitude control system.
4.3.3 Attitude Maneuvers
Some, if not all, of the thrusters on a spacecraft are devoted to attitude control.
Because these motors must restart frequently, only the fluid motors (bipropellant,
monopropellant, cold gas) are candidates.
In a three-axis stabilized system an attitude maneuver consists of rotations about
each of the spacecraft axes. Figure 4.11 is a typical thruster installation for a three-
axis stabilized spacecraft. The thrusters are arranged so that the torques applied to
the spacecraft are pure couples (no translational component).
4.3.3.7 Applying torque to a spacecraft. The elemental action in any
maneuver is applying a torque to the spacecraft about an axis. To apply torque,
spacecraft thrusters are fired in pairs producing a torque of

Equation (4.33) shows the advantage of a long moment arm. Expendable propellant
can be saved by increasing moment arm. The maximum moment arm is constrained
in a surprising way — by the inside diameter of the launch vehicle payload fairing.
The fairing dimensions of various launch vehicles are listed in Chapter 2. It is not
uncommon to design the thruster support structures to take the full diameter of the
dynamic envelope.
4.3.3.2 One-axis maneuver. A maneuver about one axis consists of three
parts: 1) angular acceleration, 2) coasting, and 3) braking. Angular acceleration
is produced by a thruster pair firing; braking is caused by a firing of the opposite
pair. Figure 4.12 shows a one-axis maneuver.

Virtually all maneuvers are three-axis maneuvers. Equation (4.40) must be ap-
plied to each axis to determine total propellant required. Most maneuvers come in
pairs, a maneuver to commanded attitude and a maneuver back to normal attitude.
Therefore, the propellant required for a complete maneuver is usually twice that
obtained from a three-axis application of Eq. (4.40).

Propulsion is frequently used to control spacecraft attitude in a limit-cycle mode
(see Chapter 5). In this mode attitude is allowed to drift until a limit is reached,
then thrusters are used for correction.

4.3.4.1 Without external torque. A limit cycle without external torque
swings the spacecraft back and forth between preset angular limits as shown in
Fig. 4.13 for one axis. When the spacecraft drifts across one of the angular limits 9i,
the attitude control system will fire a thruster pair for correction. The spacecraft
rotation will reverse and continue until the opposite angular limit is reached at
which time the opposite thruster pair will be fired. It is important that the smallest
possible impulse be used for the corrections because the impulse must be removed
by the opposite thruster pair.
Note from Fig. 4.13 that this limit cycle is an extension of the one-axis maneuver
described mathematically in the preceding section and shown in Fig. 4.12. The one-
axis maneuver equations describe the motion from point 1 to point 2 in Fig. 4.13.
The pulse width Pw, shown in Fig. 4.13, is twice the duration of ^, as discussed
in conjunction with one-axis maneuvers. The total angle of rotation Om overshoots

Each cycle includes two pulses; the propellant consumed per cycle is

Equation (4.43) shows the importance of low thrust, short burn time, and high spe-
cific impulse in pulsing operation. Pulsing engines are characterized by minimum
impulse bit 7min, where
/min = F(PW)^ (4.44)
The minimum pulse width (Pw)m{n is a characteristic of a given thruster/valve com-
bination. Table 4.5 shows typical pulsing performance of the propulsion system
types. During pulsing, the engine cools between pulses. Some of the energy from
the next pulse goes into reheating the engine. The steady-state specific impulse
can be approached if the pulses are very close together and are of long duration.
The pulsing 7sp shown in Table 4.5 is for cold engines with infrequent pulses, also
called a minimum duty cycle.
In a limit cycle the propellant consumed per unit time is a key issue. The length
of a cycle is
tcy = 2PW + 2tc (4.45)
The coast time is
tc = ^- (4.46)nFLPw
Thus, if minimum impulse bits are used, the length of a cycle is
+2Pw (4.47)
The burn time is negligible (milliseconds) compared to the coast time (seconds)
and can be neglected (This is also a conservative assumption.). The propellant
consumption per unit time is, from Eqs. (4.43) and (4.47),
^ = "2/^L (4.48)
where mp/t is the propellant consumption per unit mission time, kg/s. Equation
(4.48) shows that a wide control band is desirable as is a low minimum impulse
bit and a high 7sp.

4.3.4.2 External torque. Spacecraft are subject to a number of external
torques: 1) gravity gradient, 2) solar pressure, 3) magnetic field, and 4) aerody-
namic. Aerodynamic torques are proportional to atmospheric density and hence are
important for low Earth orbits and rapidly become negligible in higher orbits. Solar
pressure is the dominant disturbance above geosynchronous altitudes. Gravity-
gradient torques are dependent on spacecraft mass and mass distribution. Gravity
gradients have been used to stabilize spacecraft. Methods for calculating the mag-
nitude of these torques are discussed in 'Attitude Control," Chapter 5. Propulsion
requirements evolve from the necessity to correct for these torques.
4.3.4.3 One-sided limit cycle. With an external torque on the spacecraft,
rotation occurs until a limit line is reached, and a thruster pair is fired for correction.
If the limit lines are wider than a certain value, a one-sided limit cycle occurs.
Figure 4.14 shows a one-sided limit cycle.
In Fig. 4.14 when the rotation reaches one of the limit lines, a thruster pair is
pulsed. The unbalanced torque reverses the rotation, and the thrusters are fired to
start another cycle. In effect the unbalanced torque has replaced one of the thruster
pairs.
For this cycle the momentum supplied by the propulsion system exactly equals
the momentum induced by the external torque
H = Txt (4.49)
where Tx is the external torque on the spacecraft, kg-m and t the mission duration,
s. The propellant weight required to compensate for the external torque is

A one-sided limit cycle is clearly an efficient way to deal with an external
torque. For the cycle to occur, the rotational limits must be wide enough to prevent
a thruster firing from assisting the external torque.
4.3.5 Reaction Wheels
A reaction wheel is a flywheel driven by a reversible dc motor. To perform
a maneuver with a reaction wheel, the flywheel is accelerated. The spacecraft
accelerates in the opposite direction. To do a maneuver as shown in Fig. 4.12, with
reaction wheels and with a zero coast period,

refers to properties of the vehicles. The angle of spacecraft rotation is
9V = -^f^ (4.53)
4-/V
The net change in wheel speed is zero, which is the major advantage of reaction
wheels. However, eventually unbalanced torques will load the wheel (bring it to
maximum speed). The wheel can be unloaded by reversing the motor and holding
the spacecraft in position with reaction jets. The momentum of the wheel H is

The total impulse required to unload the reaction wheel is
/ = nFt = I-^- (4.56)i—i
During unloading, the momentum will be transferred from the propulsion system.
Assuming wheel speed is brought to zero, the propellant required to unload is
mp = -j^- (4.57)
The time required to unload is
t = ^ (4.58)
When reaction wheels are controlling external torques, the momentum required
for wheel unloading is equal to the momentum caused by the external torque;
Eq. (4.56) applies.
Example 4.5 Reaction Wheel Unloading
How much propellant does it take to unload one of the Magellan wheels, and how
long does it take? The Magellan wheel characteristics are maximum momentum =
27 N-m-s and maximum wheel speed = 4000 rpm = 418.879 rad/s.
The thruster pair to be used has the following characteristics: thrust = 0.889 N
and moment arm = 2.134 m.
Assuming that the wheel is fully loaded, the engine burn time required to unload
the wheel is, from Eq. (4.58),
t= (2.134)(2)(0.889) = 7>116s
If the 7sp of the engines is 150 s for short burns, the propellant required to unload
is from Eq. (4.57)

4.3.6 Spinning Spacecraft Maneuvers
To this point we have been considering three-axis oriented spacecraft. In a spin-
stabilized spacecraft attitude maneuvers consist of translations for stationkeeping
and repositioning, reorienting the spin axis, and adjusting spin velocity. Figure 4.15
shows a typical thruster installation for a spinner.
Spin-stabilized spacecraft is maneuvered by precession of the spin axis. Reori-
entation of the spin axis constitutes a change in the direction of the momentum
vector, as shown in Fig. 4.16.

4.4 Monopropellant Systems
A monopropellant system generates hot, high-velocity gas by triggering de-
composition of a single chemical—a monopropellant. The concept is shown in
Fig. 4.17.
The monopropellant is injected into a catalyst bed, where it decomposes; the
resulting hot gases are expelled through a converging/diverging nozzle generat-
ing thrust. A monopropellant must be a slightly unstable chemical, which will
decompose exothermally to produce a hot gas. There are a number of chemicals,
which will do this. Table 4.6 lists some of these.

Fig. 4.17 Monopropellant thruster concept.
There are a number of practical considerations, notably stability, that thin the list
in Table 4.6. Only three monopropellants have ever been used on flight vehicles:
hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide, and n-propyl nitrate. Shock sensitivity eliminated
n-propyl nitrate after limited use for jet engine starters. Hydrogen peroxide saw
considerable service as a monopropellant in the 1950s and 1960s (starting with the
V-2). The persistent problem with hydrogen peroxide is slow decomposition during
storage. The decomposition products cause a continuous increase in pressure in the
storage vessel and water dilution of the propellant. The pressure rise complicates
flight and ground tank design; the water dilution reduces performance.
Table 4.6 shows that hydrazine has desirable properties across the board, includ-
ing the highest specific impulse of the stable chemical group. A serious limitation
on the early use of hydrazine was ignition; hydrazine is relatively difficult to
ignite. In the early years hydrazine was ignited by injecting a start slug of nitro-
gen tetroxide. Once lit, the combustion was continued by a catalyst. Ranger and
Mariner II, as well as Mariner IV, used a hydrazine start slug system. Using start
slugs limited the number of burns to the number of slugs, two in the case of Mariner
IV. Start slugs also complicate the system. The great advantage of monopropellants
is the elimination of the oxidizer system. With the start slug the oxidizer system
was still necessary.

The need for a spontaneous catalyst led the Shell Development Company and
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop the Shell 405 iridium pellet catalyst bed in
1962. Almost unlimited spontaneous restart capability resulted. The spontaneous
restart capability along with relative stability, high performance, clean exhaust,
and low flame temperature have made hydrazine the only monopropellant in use
today.
4.4.1 Monopropellant Hydrazine Thrusters
A monopropellant hydrazine thruster is shown in Fig. 4.18. The propellant
flow into the chamber is controlled by a propellant valve, which is usually an
integral part of the thruster. The propellant is injected into a catalyst bed, where it
decomposes into hydrogen, nitrogen, and ammonia. The gases are expelled through
a converging/diverging nozzle producing thrust. The fundamental rocket engine
equation applies; the thrust generated is
F = mVe + (Pe - Pa)Ae (4.6)
The gas temperature is in the 1200°C (2200°F) range. High-temperature alloys can
be used for the converging/diverging nozzle, and radiation cooling is adequate.
Catalyst bed heaters are often used for pulsing engines to improve first pulse
performance and improve bed cycle life. The valve performance is an integral
of the thruster performance during pulsing, and the two are considered as a unit.
Monopropellant thrusters of this configuration have flown in the sizes ranging from
0.5 to 2600 N and blowdown ratios up to 6. Pulse widths as low as 7 ms have been
demonstrated,7as have thrust levels in the 4500 N class.
The decomposition of hydrazine leads first to hydrogen and ammonia. The
reaction is exothermic, and the adiabatic flame temperature is about 1700°K;
however, the ammonia further decomposes into hydrogen and nitrogen. This
reaction is endothermic and leads to a reduction in flame temperature and 7sp.
Figure 4.19 shows the theoretical vacuum specific impulse of anhydrous hydrazine,
area ratio = 50, as a function of percent ammonia dissociation. It is desirable to
limit the dissociation of ammonia as much as possible. Ammonia dissociation can
be held to about 50% in current engine designs.

4.4.1.1 Steady-state performance. A steady-state, theoretical, vacuum
specific impulse of about 240 s can be expected at an area ratio of 50:1. Real
system specific impulse will be about 93% of theoretical. Specific impulse at other
area ratios can be estimated from the ratio of thrust coefficients (see Section 4.2).
The ratio of specific heats for the exhaust is about 1.27.
4.4.1.2 Pulsing performance. Attitude control applications of monopro-
pellant hydrazine engines require operation over wide ranges of duty cycles and
pulse widths. Such use makes the pulsing specific impulse and minimum impulse
bit very important. Pulsing involves the performance of the propellant valve and
feed tubing as well as the chamber itself. A typical pulse is shown in Fig. 4.20.
Pressure response time is the time (measured from the propellant valve actuation
signal) required to reach an arbitrary percentage of steady-state chamber pressure.
Response time is affected by 1) the valve response characteristics, 2) time for the
propellant to flow from the valve to the injector (hydraulic delay), 3) the ignition
delay (time to wet the catalyst bed and for initial decomposition heat release to
bring the catalyst to a temperature at which ignition becomes rapid), and 4) the
pressure rise time (time to decompose enough hydrazine to fill the void space in
the catalyst bed and heat the whole bed).
Valve response characteristics and feed line hydraulic delay vary for each spe-
cific design. Valves are available with response times better than 10 ms. The dis-
tance between the valve and injector must be minimized; however, the control of
heat soak back to the valve sets a minimum length for the injector tube.
With proper injector design, ignition delay will be approximately 10 to 20 ms for
catalyst and propellant temperatures in the range of 5-20°C. With a catalyst bed
temperature in the range of 260°C, ignition delay will be approximately 1-2 ms.
Pressure rise time is a much larger fraction of the response time than ignition delay
for most thrust chambers. Response times from valve signal to 90% of steady-state
chamber pressure of 15 ms have been demonstrated with tail-off time (signal to
10% thrust) of 20ms.7
In Fig. 4.20 the response from signal to 90% thrust is 15 ms; the tail-off time
is 20 ms. If the duty cycle is long, the engine will cool between pulses, and thrust
will not reach rated value because of energy losses to engine heating. If pulses are
frequent, thrust will reach rated value.

Time, ms
Fig. 4.20 Typical 20-ms pulse.
In the absence of test data, the minimum impulse bit can be estimated by as-
suming typical system response and that time t in Fig. 4.20, from ignition to first
loss of thrust, is equal to the pulse width. Because impulse is the area under the
thrust time curve,

where F is the steady-state thrust reached, N; and t is the pulse width, time from

For all practical purposes impulse bit can be estimated as Ft. For infrequent
pulses the thruster will be cold, and full rated thrust will not be reached. For
such cases the thrust level corresponding to the expected gas temperature should
be used. Figure 4.21 shows pulsing vacuum specific impulse for monopropellant
hydrazine systems as a function of pulse width and engine off time.
Pulsing specific impulse is low at low duty cycles because energy is lost reheating
the motor. Short pulses deliver low specific impulse for the same reason. Low duty

cycles and short pulses in combination deliver specific impulse as low as 115 s.
Specific impulse is limited at low duty cycles by the performance of an ambient
temperature bed. The performance of a thruster operating with a cold bed can be
estimated by assuming the exhaust gas exits at the bed temperature.
All of the hydrazine that reaches the catalyst bed is decomposed; there are no
liquid losses on start or shutdown.
4.4.1.3 Negative pulses. In the course of a steady-state burn, it is often
desirable to pulse off to create attitude control torques. The Magellan and Viking
spacecraft have used the pulse-off technique. In the Magellan case the 445-N
thrusters were fired in steady state during the solid motor burn for Venus orbit
insertion. (The 445-N engines are aligned with the motor thrust vector.) Pulsing
off was used for thrust vector control during the burn. A similar strategy was used
by Viking Lander during the deorbit phase.
4.4.1.4 Thruster weight. A least-squares curve fit of the weight of 19 actual
monopropellant thruster/valve designs (Fig. 4.21) produces the following relation
for estimating thruster/valve weight,
Wt = 0.0033F (4.63)
For low thrust levels the thruster weight approaches the valve weight as shown by
Fig. 4.21. Use 0.3 kg as a minimum thruster/valve weight for low thrust levels.
Figure 4.21 is for a thruster and a single valve; the estimated weight must be
increased if redundant valves are used.
4.4.2 Propellant Systems
The purpose of the propellant system is to contain the propellants and to serve
them to the engine on demand, at the proper pressure, quality, and cleanliness.

functions. It is important that the usable propellant quantity be calculated under
worst-case conditions (see Section 4.3).
Not all of the propellant loaded can be used; a certain amount is trapped or load-
ing uncertainty. Trapped propellant is the propellant remaining in the feed lines,
tanks and valves, hold-up in expulsion devices, and retained vapor left in the system
with the pressurizing gas. Trapped propellant is about 3% of the usable propellant.
The measurement uncertainty in propellant loading is about 0.5%. The uncer-
tainty is added to the load to ensure that the usable propellant can be no less than
worst-case requirement.
Propellant reserves are a very valuable commodity. The more of the project
reserves placed in propellant the better. There are three primary reasons for this:
1) propellant is usually the life-limiting expendable on a spacecraft; 2) it is often
desirable to make unplanned maneuvers in response to unexpected results or emer-
gency conditions; 3) there are usually extended mission objectives that can be
achieved after the primary mission—if there is propellant. Voyager, for example,
visited Uranus and Neptune after the primary mission was over. Propellant reserve
can be used in many useful ways during the mission, unlike weight margin, power
margin, and most other margin types.
4.4.2.2 Zero-g propellant control. The location of the ullage bubble, or
bubbles, becomes indeterminate in zero-g conditions unless the liquid and gas are
positively separated. Figure 4.22 shows zero-g bubble shapes.
Unless the gas location is controlled, there is no way to guarantee gas-free liq-
uid to the engine. Although an engine can tolerate small amounts of gas, serious
failures have occurred as a result of gas ingestion. It is good design practice to
prevent any gas ingestion. Spin-stabilized spacecraft can take advantage of cen-
trifugal force. Three-axis spacecraft or spacecraft with a low spin rate must use
one of the following schemes: 1) capillary devices, which use surface tension to

keep gas and liquid separated (particularly useful for bipropellant systems, like
the Space Shuttle and Viking Orbiter, because they are compatible with strong
oxidizers); 2) diaphragms and bladders, which are physical separation devices
made of elastomer or Teflon® (Voyager, Mariner 9, and Magellan used these; elas-
tomers are not compatible with oxidizers); 3) bellows, a metal separation device,
used by Minuteman; and 4) traps, a check valve protected compartment, used by
Transtage. Figure 4.23 shows the concepts in schematic.
4.4.2.3 Capillary devices. Capillary devices take advantage of the small
pressure differences between a wetting liquid and a gas. For a simple screen device
(Fig. 4.24) the AP capability is inversely proportional to radius of the screen
openings.
The Young-Laplace equation1 states that the maximum differential pressure
across a spherical surface is
AP = — (4.64)r
where AP is the pressure difference sustained by a screen, Pa (lb/ft2); <r is the
surface tension of the liquid, N/m2 (lb/ft); and r is the radius of the screen pores,
m (ft). Extremely fine screen will support approximately 0.5 m (hydrostatic head)
of hydrazine against an adverse l-g acceleration.
Screen devices are shaped to maintain liquid over the tank outlet for any acceler-
ation direction the spacecraft will experience. The capillary device used to control
the Space Shuttle reaction control system (RCS) propellants (N2O4 and MMH) is
shown in Fig. 4.25. In the Space Shuttle, a system with complicated maneuvering,
the capillary system also becomes complex. Both capillary devices and bladders
have demonstrated an expulsion efficiency of 99%.
4.4.2.4 Propellant control: spin-stabilized spacecraft. A spinning space-
craft can use centrifugal force to control propellant position. Spin rates above about
6 rpm are required for centrifugal force to dominate surface tension and slosh
forces; it takes an analysis of the expected spacecraft loads to verify the adequacy
of centrifugal force. An expulsion efficiency of over 97% can be expected.8
The tank outlet is placed perpendicular to the spin axis pointing outboard for
the liquid to be held over the outlet by centrifugal force. Unfortunately the tank

outlet is then horizontal when the spacecraft is being assembled and tested; in this
position the tank is difficult to drain. There are three solutions to this problem
shown in Fig. 4.26 along with the pros and cons of each:
1) The tank can be kept simple and spherical, and the entire spacecraft
(or propulsion module) can be rotated to drain the tank. Alternatively, an addi-
tional port can be installed in the tank for drainage.
2) An internal drain tube can be installed sloped so that either acceleration vector
will drain the liquid.
3) Or the tank can be shaped so that it will drain with either acceleration vec-
tor. Such a tank has a teardrop or conosphere shape. This design has been used
successfully on a number of recent spacecraft. One disadvantage of this design is
that energy dissipation from fuel slosh reduces the stability margin of a dual-spin
spacecraft; this reduction is worse than a spherical tank and can be as much as a
factor of 30 (Ref. 9).
4.4.2.5 Propellant loading. Spacecraft systems use the weight method to
measure propellant loaded. The system is moved to a remote area and weighed
empty. The propellant is then loaded using special clothing and procedures to
protect the personnel. Loading is a hazardous event; one or more dry runs of the
procedure will precede the actual event. After loading the system is weighed again.
The weight change is the propellant load.
Because of the loading process, it is highly desirable to design any liquid propul-
sion system to be readily removable from the spacecraft as a module, because

<<<PAGE 202>>>

190 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
1) the propulsion system can be taken to the remote area for loading, independent
of the spacecraft operations; 2) work can proceed on the spacecraft in parallel to
the loading process; and 3) if a spill should occur during loading, the equipment at
risk is limited. The loading takes place at the launch site close to the launch date.
This is a time and place when these advantages are very important.
4.4.3 Pressurization Subsystems
The purpose of a pressurization system is to control the gas pressure in the
propellant tanks. For spacecraft systems the tank pressure must be higher than the
engine chamber pressure by an amount equal to the system losses; in addition a
significant delta pressure must be maintained across the injector for combustion
stability.
4.4.3.1 Pressurants. The pressurant, or pressurizing gas, must be inert in
the presence of the propellants, and a low molecular weight is desirable. There
are two pressurants in spacecraft use: nitrogen and helium. Helium provides the
lightest system, but it is difficult to prevent helium leakage; therefore, nitrogen is
used if the weight situation will allow it.
4.4.3.2 Ullage. The volume that the pressurant occupies above the propel-
lant is called the ullage. This curious term was borrowed from the wine industry.
4.4.3.3 Slowdown system. There are two basic types of pressurization
systems in use today. They are regulated and blowdown. A blowdown system is
shown in Fig. 4.27. In a blowdown system the tank is pressurized to an initial level,
and the pressure is allowed to decay as propellant is used.
The advantages of a blowdown system are as follows: 1) it is the simplest method
and hence more reliable, and 2) it is less expensive because of fewer components.
The disadvantages are as follows: 1) Tank pressure, thrust, and propellant flow
rate vary as a function of time, and 2) 7sp is a second-order function of chamber
pressure and drops as a function of time. Variability of flow rate and engine inlet

pressure make the blow down system difficult to use with bipropellant systems.
However, the disadvantages are slight for monopropellant systems; modern space-
craft monopropellant systems use blowdown exclusively.
4.4.3.4 Tank gas thermodynamics
Slowdown ratio. The ratio of initial pressure to final pressure is called the
blowdown ratio B. The blowdown ratio is
B = ?* = Y# (4-65)
Ptf Vgl
and
v#= (4-66)
(4.67)P(B-I)
where
Vgi = initial ullage volume, m3 (ft3)
Pgi = initial gas pressure, Pa (psia)
Vgf = final ullage volume, m3 (ft3)
Pgf = final gas pressure, Pa (psia)
Vu = volume of useable propellant, m3 (ft3)
Wu — weight of useable propellant, kg (Ibm)
B = blowdown ratio unitless
p — propellant density, kg/m3 (lb/ft3)
The maximum blowdown ratio is determined by the inlet pressure range the
engines can accept. Ratios of three to four are in common use today; a blowdown
ratio of six has been flown.9
Equation of state. From thermodynamics we know that for an ideal gas at any
state point, the product of the tank pressure and the ullage volume is
PV = WRT (4.68)
where
W = gas weight, kg (Ib)
P = gas pressure (psia)
V = ullage volume, m3 (ft3)
R = specific gas constant = universal gas constant/molecular weight;
universal gas constant is 83 14. 14 joule/kg-mole °K (1545 ft-lbf/lb-mole °R)
T = temperature of the gas, °K (°R)
Equation (4.68) is the equation of state; it relates the thermodynamic parameters
for a perfect gas and steady-state conditions. (The departure of real gases from
the behavior of perfect gases is normally negligible.) The equation of state is
particularly useful for calculating pressurant weight in the form

Isothermal expansion. For spacecraft the outflow of propellant is usually slow,
and heat transfer will keep the gas temperature fixed at or near the propellant
temperature, and the process is isothermal. For an isothermal process
Vi_

During the blowdown process, the tank pressure at any time t is
p(t) =V •
mp(t)/p(4.70)
(4.71)
where P(t) is the tank gas pressure at any time t, Pgi is initial gas pressure; mp(t)
is the total propellant mass removed from the tank in the time interval ending at
time t, kg (Ib); and p is the propellant density, kg/m3 (lb/ft3).
Isentropic expansion. If propellant is withdrawn rapidly as it would be in a
translation burn, the gas expansion in the ullage will be isentropic, and the gas
temperature will drop during the process. For isentropic expansion
and the tank pressure at any time t is
p(t) = pgimp(t)/p + Vgi(4.72)
(4.73)
The difference between isothermal expansion [Eq. (4.71)] and isentropic expansion
[Eq. (4.73)] is the exponent of the volumetric expansion term, k.
Figure 4.28 shows the difference in tank pressure with rapid, isentropic expan-
sion and slow isothermal expansion for the same volume change. With isentropic

expansion the temperature drops more rapidly and drops below propellant temper-
ature. After engine shutdown (point 2 in Fig. 4.28), the gas temperature warms up
to the propellant temperature in time. With isentropic expansion the tank pressure
and thrust will be lower during a portion of the burn than isothermal calculations
would predict.
Blowdown system thrust. With a blowdown system the tank pressure, propel-
lant flow rate, and thrust are a function of time, dropping as the bum progresses.
Thus a blowdown system cannot be used in a situation that requires a constant
thrust.
Bipropellant systems have not yet been flown with a blowdown system because
of the difficulty in holding the two propellant tanks at the same pressure and the
concern about operating bipropellant engines over a wide pressure range; however,
there is serious development work going on in this area.10 Regulated pressurization
systems will be discussed in Section 4.5.
4.4.4 Tankage Weight
(Note: The information in this section is intended for tank weight estimation
only. The structural design of a propulsion system tank requires analysis
beyond what is described in this section.)
The major dry weight component in a liquid-propellant propulsion system is the
tankage. In this section we will show how tank weight can be estimated. First,
the volume of the tank must be established and maximum tank pressure set.
Then the tank weight can be estimated. For a propellant tank there are four com-
ponents to the volume: 1) the initial ullage; 2) the useable propellant volume;
3) the unusable propellant volume, which is 3-4% of usable; and 4) the volume
occupied by the zero-g device.
Example 4.7 Blowdown Propellant Tank Volume
What is the propellant tank size for a blowdown hydrazine monopropellant
system with the following specifications?
7Sp = 225 s
/ = 50,000 N-s
B =4
Assume an elastomeric bladder, a spherical tank, and a design temperature range
of5-37.8°C.
The useable propellant weight
The density of hydrazine at 37.8°C (100°F) = 992.15 kg/m3 and volume of the
usable propellant is Vu = 0.022839 m3 or 22,839 cc.
The volume of unusable propellant is about 3% of useable for a monopropellant
system; thus, the total volume of propellant is Vp = 23,525 cc.

<<<PAGE 206>>>

194 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
The initial ullage volume is, from Eq. (4.66),
V.^ =7613oc
The tank volume before provisions for the bladder is
Vp+ ygi = 23,525 + 7613 = 31138cc
A bladder is essentially a hemispherical shell that nests within the tank shell.
The internal radius of the bladder is approximately
J (0.75)(31138)r = J ———————— = 19.516cmn
The area of the bladder is half the surface of a sphere
Ab = 2nr2- = 27r(19.516)2" = 2393.21 cm2
The bladder thickness can be expected to be about 0.20 cm; therefore, the volume
of the bladder can be approximated as
Vb = 0.02(2393.21) = 479 cc
and the required volume of the tank is 31,617 cc.
4.4.4.1 Spherical tanks. After determining the volume required, the tank
weight can be estimated. The common tank configurations are spherical tanks
and barrel tanks with hemispherical domes. Tank weights are a byproduct of the
structural design of the tanks. For spheres the load in the walls is pressure times
area as shown in Fig. 4.29. The force PA tending to separate the tank is
PA = Pnr2 (4.74)
where P is the maximum pressure in the tank, Pa (pressure above atmospheric);
r the internal radius of the tank, m; and A the area, m2.
Because stress is load divided by the area carrying the load,

where a is the allowable stress, N/m2 (after all structural margins are accounted
for, including man rating if required) and t is the thickness of the tank wall, m.
Knowing the thickness of the walls, the weight of the tank membrane can be
calculated as
R = r + t (4.77)
W = 4/3np(R3 - r3) (4.78)
where W is the tank membrane weight, kg; p the density of the tank material,
kg/m3; and R the outside radius of the sphere, m.
4.4.4.2 Cylindrical barrels. For cylindrical barrels the hoop stress is twice
that in a spherical shell, as shown in Fig. 4.30:
Prt = — (4.79)a
The weight of the barrel is
W = nLp(R2 - r2) (4.80)
where L is the length of the barrel section, m.
4.4.4.3 Penetrations and girth reinforcements. The membrane weight is
for a perfect pressure shell. Areas of reinforcement, called land areas, are needed
for 1) girth welds (the weld between two hemispheres), 2) penetration welds (welds
for inlet and outlets), 3) bladder attachment (attachment between a bladder and the
tank wall), and 4) structural mounting of the tank.
Weight must be added to the membrane weight to account for these reinforce-
ments. Weld areas must be reinforced because of the reduction in material prop-
erties near welds. For the girth weld two reinforcing bands with a thickness of /,
a width of about 5 cm each are added, as shown in Fig. 4.31.
Penetrations for attachments, inlet and outlet tubes weaken the shell and require
reinforcement rings. These are about 15 cm in diameter centered on the penetration,
with a thickness of t. Mounting pads on the tank add about 2% of the supported
weight. Penetrations, girth land areas, and mounting pads normally add about 25%
to the shell weight.

It is important to design the tank mounting so that the tank can expand and
contract without being constrained. Otherwise expansion will put unexpected loads
into the walls.
Example 4.8 Spherical Propellant Tank
Weight Estimate
Estimate the weight of a spherical titanium propellant tank with the following
specifications: maximum working pressure = 4653.96 kPa, allowable stress =
690,000 kPa, internal volume = 0.02812 m3, and elastomeric diaphragm.
Provide land areas for penetrations at each pole, a girth weld, and a structural
mount pad at the lower pole.
Calculate the membrane thickness first:
0.75(0.02812)= 0.18865 m (inside, minimum)n
From Eq. (4.76), using allowable stress of 690,000 kPa (for example only, the
allowable stress is a matter for considerable analysis and debate),
The thickness, 0.0647 cm, is the minimum acceptable; therefore, tolerances
must add to the thickness
t = 0.0657 ± 0.002 cm
Weight estimates should be made for the maximum thickness. With thickness
determined, the tank outside radius is
R = 18.865 + 0.0677 = 18.932 cm (outside)
Calculate membrane weight using a density of 4429.89 kg/m3 or 0.004430 kg/cc:
W = -7r(0.00443)[(18.932)3 - (18.865)3] = 1.332kg
Now calculate the reinforced areas starting with the girth weld land:

W = 27r(18.9)(0.0637)(5)(2)(0.004430) = 0.335kg

The tank assembly weight is as follows: tank shell, 1.81 kg; diaphragm, 0.087;
and total, 1.897kg.
Example 4.9 Spherical Tank Weight Estimate:
Short Form
The weight estimate for a spherical tank can be approximated with less com-
putation by noting that the tank shell weight is proportional to the product of
pressure and volume. The proportionality constant can be developed by a series of
calculations similar to the preceding example. The resulting approximation is
Wt=O.Oll6PV (4.81)
where
Wt = weight of a titanium spherical tank shell, land areas and attachments, kg
P = maximum tank pressure, kPa
V = tank volume, m3

4.4.5 Monopropellant System Design Example
This section illustrates how the information in the preceding sections can be
used to produce a complete monopropellant system design to the phase A level.
The spacecraft under consideration is a geosynchronous communication satellite,
which is placed in orbit by Atlas Centaur and an apogee kick motor. The spacecraft
is three-axis stabilized except during the solid motor burn for which the spacecraft
is spun and despun. The steps in a monopropellant propulsion system design are
summarized here.
1) Define the requirements: steady-state impulse required from orbital mechan-
ics (set maneuvering thrust level); pulsing impulse required from attitude control
system (ACS); maneuvering thrust level required from ACS; wheel unloading if
any from ACS; minimum revolutions per minute if spinner from ACS; maximum
moment arm from launch vehicle shroud; fault protection from customer; temper-
ature limits from thermal control.

2) Calculate the propellant required; add margin.
3) Select the propellant control device.
4) Decide dual-vs single-propellant tanks.
5) Decide propellant tank type, sphere, barrel, conosphere.
6) Select the pressurant: helium if mass is critical, otherwise nitrogen.
7) Select pressurization system type, and set the performance parameters, max
tank pressure, and blowdown ratio.
8) Design the propellant tank.
9) Design the engine modules and general arrangement.
10) Design the system schematic; plan redundancy.
11) Calculate system mass.
12) Conduct trade studies of system alternatives; repeat the process.
4.4.5.1 Requirements. The following requirements have been established
for the system: steady-state impulse required N-S stationkeeping, 234866 N-s;
E-W stationkeeping, 25443 N-s; reaction wheel unloading, 37854 N-s; and puls-
ing impulse required spin/despin/nutation damping, 9340 N-s; initial orientation,
15570 N-s; propellant system temperature range 5°-50°C; maneuver 180 deg about
any axis in 20 s; spacecraft max moment of inertia = 1000 kg-m2; launch vehicle =
Titan 4/Centaur. No single, nonstructural failure can cause loss of more than 50%
of the mission objectives or mission duration.
4.4.5.2 Propellant inventory. All of the burns are pulsing or short steady-
state burns. Select catalyst bed heating to improve 7sp and to improve catalyst bed
life. Estimate the average 7sp for short burns to be 215 s and for pulsing 110 s.
With these assumptions the propellant inventory, Table 4.8, can be constructed.
Providing propellant reserves is always an area for lively project discussion; alter-
natively, it may be specified by your customer. A 50% reserve in not excessive for
early stages of a project.
4.4.5.3 Initial selections. Now let us make some arbitrary choices so that
the design can proceed; these choices can be revisited by later trade studies. Initial
choices are blowdown pressurization (blowdown is almost universally used for
monopropellant systems); blowdown ratio is 4; helium pressurant; initial tank
pressure is 3619.75 kPa; diaphragm propellant control device; dual spherical tanks
(you can readily show that this propellant load is too big for a single tank); and
allowable stress 690,000 kPa.

The tank volume, before provisions for a diaphragm, is
Vt = 0.2600 + 0.08376 = 0.3437 m3 (0.17 19m3 each)
Estimating the diaphragm volume at 1% of the tank volume or 0.0018 m3
produces a volume of 0.1737 m3 for each tank. The tank can now be designed
using the procedure demonstrated in Example 4.8, or by the short method, with
the following result. For the tank design the inside diameter is 0.6916 m, the wall
thickness is 0.093 1 cm, and the shell weight is 7.595 kg. For the diaphragm design
the diaphragm volume is 1524 cc, and the weight is 1.52 kg. The tank assembly
weight is 9.115 kg each or 18.23 kg for the pair. The allowance made for the
diaphragm is 0.00021 m3 larger than required. The tank design could be iterated,
but the gain would be small.

three- axis stabilized mode; the latter mode governs thruster arrangement. It takes

4.4.5.7 Thrust level. This vehicle is required to make a 180-deg turn about
any axis in 20 s. The maximum moment of inertia about any axis is 1000 kg/m.
The launch vehicle is Titan 4 Centaur; therefore, from Table 2.15 the maximum
shroud diameter is 4.5 m; allowing clearance, 4.4 m, and / = 2.2 m. (This choice
of radius to the thrusters will have to be reviewed to determine if it is clear of the
dynamic envelope of the shroud, which is smaller than the physical dimensions.)
Rearranging Eq. (4.39) yields
nltl(4.83)
and minimum thrust is
F =47r(100Q)
2(2.2)(400)= 7.14N
At this point an industry search would be made for a thruster with a thrust level
equal to or greater than 7.14 N. Let us assume that an acceptable engine was found
with a 7.5-N thrust level.
4.4.5.8 System schematic. Figure 4.32 shows a simplified system sche-
matic for the propulsion system as it has evolved so far.
Table 4.9 summarizes the logic used to establish the system schematic in a failure
modes and effects (FMEA) table. (Some form of FMEA is normally a contractual
requirement.) Valves 1A and IB are opened at the start of the flight; therefore,
they should be considered open as you read Table 4.9. Failure types are considered
only once; symmetrical failures are not tabulated.

Fault tolerance requirements dictate redundant branches of 12 engines each to ac-
commodate an engine failure. If the thrust-chamber valves are placed in series, their
dominant failure mode (leakage or failure open) can be tolerated. Thrust-chamber
valve failure closed can be tolerated because the engines are redundant. (Series-
parallel valves are an alternative solution.) If the dual tanks are cross strapped, a fail-
ure of either propellant system can be accommodated. If ordnance valves are used
for cross strapping, the system can be sealed from propellant loading to flight use.
Table 4.9 shows that the system in Fig. 4.32 is satisfactorily failure tolerant. The
schematic can now be completed with the addition of 1) fill and drain provisions,
2) heaters and thermostats, 3) instrumentation, and 4) filters. The schematic with
these additions is shown in Fig. 4.33.

202 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
Fill and drain connections are needed to load helium and hydrazine. The fill
valves must be capped to provide a double seal against leakage. Filters are required
on the ground equipment side of each fill and drain connection, thus avoiding addi-
tional flight filters. Filters are required downstream of all pyrovalves and upstream
of all valve seats. For the schematic shown in Fig. 4.33, two filters are adequate.
There are several filters manufactured for this use that have a 15-20 /x absolute
rating.
Hydrazine must be prevented from freezing; the freezing point is about 2°C. If
freezing should occur, the hydrazine shrinks. Line rupture will occur during thaw if
liquid fills the volume behind the frozen hydrazine and is trapped. Satellite failures
have occurred as result of this process. The power required for propulsion heating
is a product of the thermal design of the vehicle. The most common technique is
to provide heaters and thermostats on the lines, tanks, and thrust chamber valves.
Catalyst beds are also heated to increase performance and bed life.
Instrumentation is selected so that any failure can be detected from analysis of
the data. This requires temperature and pressure in each segment of the system.
The FMEA should be reviewed with the instrument list in mind. The instrumen-
tation shown in Fig. 4.33 is adequate if ground testing with more complete in-
strumentation has been performed. Chamber pressure is a valuable measurement;
however, the measurement is not usually attempted in very small thrusters. Cham-
ber pressure can be calculated from upstream pressure given adequate ground-test
data.
4.4.5.9 First pulse considerations. The first pulses from a flight system
are usually required to stabilize the residual rotation rates just after separation from
the upper stage. This process is very important; the first pulses must have the full
impulse that the attitude control system expects. For good first pulses the liquid
system must be 1) gas free, 2) filled with hydrazine from the tank down to the
thrust chamber valves, and 3) the catalyst bed must be hot.
Turning the catalyst bed heaters on before separation is easy; filling the hydrazine
system is not. At launch the hydrazine system is full of dry nitrogen from valve 1A
and IB down to the thrust-chamber valves. If nothing were done, the first pulses
would be nitrogen not hot gas. One solution to this problem is to open valve 1A
and IB during the upper-stage flight and then open all thrust-chamber valves until
each chamber temperature rises. This approach might not be satisfactory to the
launch vehicle because of the upsetting torques produced and because of exhaust
impingement on the upper stage. The alternative approach is to open the thrust-
chamber valves during the upper-stage flight with valve 1A and IB closed. This
step bleeds the trapped dry nitrogen into the hard vacuum of space. If valves 1A
and IB are now opened, hydrazine would fill the lines at very high velocity. When
the hydrazine reaches the thrust-chamber valves, the deceleration shock can be
energetic enough to decompose the hydrazine. To avoid this problem, orifices are
required in the propellant lines to limit the initial hydrazine flow rate. If these
orifices can be made small enough to force orderly initial filling and large enough
not to obstruct the maximum thruster demand, the problem is solved. If not, separate
bleed lines are required for the orifice flow; this is additional hardware not shown
in Fig. 4.33.

4.4.5.10 System mass estimate. The system is now well enough de-
fined for the first mass estimate shown in Table 4.10. The thruster weights, from
Eq. (4.63), are
Wt = 0.4 + 0.0033(7.5) = 0.42kg
However, Eq. (4.63) was compiled for a thruster and one valve. The mass was
adjusted upward to 0.82 kg to account for the additional valve. The remaining
masses in Table 4.10 were estimated by analogy or calculated in the preceding
paragraphs.
4.4.5.11 Trade Studies. The first cycle of propulsion system design has
been completed and a baseline established. The next step is to find ways to improve
it. Potential improvements should be evaluated by comparison to the baseline by
way of trade studies. Some of the trade studies that could be made against the
preceding baseline are as follows: 1) evaluate the use of a single-propellant tank,
and 2) evaluate the use of a dual-mode system.
4.4.6 Flight Monopropellant Systems
In this section several monopropellant systems with a successful flight history
are described. They are arranged in the order of their launch date and hence in
the order of increasing design sophistication. Each made a significant contribu-
tion to monopropellant system technology. The characteristics of the systems are
summarized in Table 4.11.

4.4.6.1 LANDS AT 3. The LANDS AT 3 offers an illustration of a flight
monopropellant system at its simplest. Ground control uses the system to estab-
lish precise orbital parameters after orbit insertion and to make orbit adjustments
throughout the mission in order to maintain overlapping coverage in the imagery.
The system, shown in Fig. 4.34, is constructed as a single module consisting of
three rocket engines, a propellant tank, and feed system.
Each of the engine assemblies consists of a series redundant propellant valve, a
catalyst bed, and a nozzle. Operation of the solenoid valves by electrical command
produces thrust. Thirty kilograms of anhydrous hydrazine are loaded through a
propellant fill valve. The single spherical titanium propellant tank contains an
elastomeric diaphragm for propellant position control. The nitrogen pressurant is
loaded through a fill valve. The pressurization is by a 3.3 to 1 blowdown system.
The thrust range operating in a blowdown mode is from 4.4 N initially to 1.3 N
finally. The system total impulse is 67,700 N-s. The system is mounted to the
spacecraft sensory ring with the three thrusters located along the pitch and roll
axes. The thrusters are aligned such that each thrust vector passes approximately
through the spacecraft center of mass. With these thrust vectors the system is
capable of imparting incremental velocity to the spacecraft to correct orbital errors
and perturbations.
More complicated monopropellant systems would provide ACS pulsing, thrust
vector control, and maneuvering. These capabilities would be provided by addi-
tional thrusters. A planetary system would require additional redundancy, and the
system would be sealed by ordnance valves to prevent leakage during coast periods.
4.4.6.2 Voyager. The Voyager spacecraft, developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, is one of the most successful scientific spacecraft ever to fly. It was
launched in 1979; it gathered scientific data at each of the outer planets arriving
at Neptune in August of 1989. It used monopropellant hydrazine system for orbit
trims and attitude control. It used a solid rocket motor to supplement the launch
vehicle energy at launch. The monopropellant system supplied thrust vector control
during the solid motor burn. The system schematic is shown in Fig. 4.35 (Ref. 15).

During solid motor burn, pitch and yaw were provided by four 445-N thrusters;
roll control was provided by four 22-N thrusters. At the completion of the solid
motor burn, the spent motor and the eight hydrazine thrusters associated with it
were jettisoned. Note the hydrazine disconnect in Fig. 4.35. It is unusual to break
a hydrazine system in flight; however, this disconnect operated satisfactorily.
The trajectory correction and attitude control system contained 104 kg of hy-
drazine in a 71-cm-diam titanium tank, which incorporated an elastomeric bladder.
The tank was pressurized initially to 3103 kPa at 40.6°C. Pressurization was by
blowdown.
Two branches of thrusters were provided, along with ability to switch pitch-
yaw thrusters and roll thrusters independently. Switching was done with latch
valves; latch valve position was telemetered. There were 16 0.89-N thrusters and
valves. Heaters (1.4 W) were provided for each catalyst bed to maintain a minimum
temperature of 115 ± 8°F.
During development of the system, a degradation in peak PC and an increase
of ignition delay were observed in vacuum testing the 0.89-N (0.2-lb) engines
at 10-ms pulse widths. It was determined that the degradation was caused by
trace amounts (<0.5%) of aniline in the hydrazine. The use of super pure (Viking
Grade) hydrazine cured the problem.15 The purification technique was developed
by Lockheed Martin for the Viking Lander. The unusually long mission pro-
vided interesting flight data on the propulsion system. The cycles accumulated
on the thrusters in the first 18 months of the mission are shown in Table 4.12
(Ref. 15).

4388 mission days. Linear extrapolation would place the total number of cycles on
the Voyager 2 thrusters between 175,000 and 345,000 depending on the sharing
between branch 1 and 2. The thrusters were qualified for 400,000 cycles.
4.4.6.3 INTELSAT V system. The INTELSAT V spacecraft is the fifth
high-capacity communications spacecraft to be developed for INTELSAT corpo-
ration. At the time of its launch, it was the largest communications spacecraft ever
built.17 The INTELSAT V monopropellant system consists of two titanium propel-
lant tanks, redundant sets of 10 thrusters each, and associated valves. Figure 4.36

208 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
Twenty-two N thrusters are used for orientation and orbit trim. Spacecraft
spin/despin, east/west stationkeeping, and pitch/yaw control are performed by
2.7-N thrusters. Electrothermal thrusters are used for north/south stationkeeping,
and these 0.4-N thrusters are backed up by the 3.7-N thrusters. Roll maneuvers
are performed by 0.4-N thrusters.
The plumbing is arranged so that using isolation valves either tank can feed
either or both sets of thrusters. Capillary propellant management devices control
the hydrazine under 0-g or l-g conditions in all tank positions. The tank internal
volume is 140.7 liters and allows a loading of 213 kg of propellant. Nominally
185 kg are required for the mission.
A blowdown pressurization system is used. The tanks are high-strength titanium.
All other components are stainless steel; joints are all welded. Electrochemical
0.4-N thrusters were chosen for the high 7sp (average 304 s) derived from operating
at 2470 K.
4.4.6.4 Magellan system.19 The mission of the Magellan spacecraft was
to provide a first full surface map of Venus. The map was obtained from an ellip-
tical Venus orbit using a synthetic aperture radar. The Magellan monopropellant
blowdown system provided tip-off control during vehicle separations, reaction
wheel desaturation, orbit trim maneuvers (for both the sun orbit and the Venus
orbit), rate damping after any burn, and thrust vector control and attitude control
during the solid rocket motor firing. The system was designed so that no single
malfunction could prevent mission completion.
Super pure hydrazine is fed from the titanium diaphragm tank through the
isolation valves to the four engine modules. Each module contains two 0.9-N,
one 22-N, and two 445-N thrusters. The primary purpose of the aft-facing 445-N
engines was thrust vector control during solid rocket motor firing. They were also
used for orbit trims. The 22-N engines and 0.9-N engines were used for attitude
control functions. The thrusters were redundant and were fed by dual-propellant
feed systems. Thrusters also served as a backup in the event of a reaction wheel
failure. The system schematic is shown in Fig. 4.37.
The pressurization system was a blowdown type using helium pressurant. The
maximum operating propellant tank pressure was 3103 kPa (450 psig), and the
blowdown ratio was 4. The pressurization system is unusual in that a single recharge
was provided by an auxiliary tank containing helium at 22,060 kPa (3200 psig).
The propellant lines were evacuated during the launch process by opening the
thrust chamber valves. During the IUS burn, after deployment from the Space
Shuttle, the isolation valves (PO and PI in Fig. 4.37) were opened to allow pro-
pellant to fill the lines. Flow rate during line filling was controlled by orifices to
prevent shock to the propellant. The propellant and pressurization systems were all
welded stainless steel (except for the titanium tanks). There were no mechanical
joints in the system.
The liquid propulsion module was readily separable from the spacecraft so
that propellant loading could be done at a remote area apart from the spacecraft
and off the critical path.
The spacecraft was developed by Lockheed Martin (then Martin Marietta) under
contract to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft was launched on Space
Shuttle Atlantis on 9 May 1989; the mission was completely successful.

4.5 Bipropellant Systems
Bipropellant systems offer the most performance (7sp as high as 450 s) and the
most versatility (pulsing, restart, variable thrust). They also offer the most failure
modes and the highest price tags.
4.5.1 Bipropellant Rocket Engines
The major parts of a pressure-fed engine are the injector, the nozzle and the
cooling system, and thrust-chamber valves, as shown in Fig. 4.38. (Launch vehicle
systems are pump fed and considerably more complicated.)

bustion chamber in such a way as to promote stable, efficient combustion without

overheating the injector face or the chamber walls. The injector design is the single
most important contributor to engine performance. It also determines to a large
measure whether combustion will be stable. Figure 4.39 shows injector configu-
rations in use.
The most sensitive area in a bipropellant engine is the combustion zone of the
thrust chamber just downstream of the injector. Propellants enter this high-pressure
zone as room-temperature liquids and leave as supersonic gases at velocities greater
than 600 m/s and temperatures as high as 3500°C. Energy release rates may be
as great as 200 kW/cc. Mixing, ignition, and combustion occur in milliseconds.
Propellants are introduced through the injector plate at high velocity so that the
fuel and oxidizer are shattered into droplets small enough to complete combustion
upstream of the throat. Continuous and rapid combustion must occur near the
injector face so that pockets of mixed but unreacted propellants do not form and
explode. The thrust developed by a single pair of injector orifices can be as high
as 2000 N.
4.5.1.2 Cooling. The adiabatic flame temperature for nitrogen tetroxide
and monomethylhydrazine is 3414°K; the heat-transfer rates at the throat can be
as high as 3200 J/s-cm2 during operation. Clearly, throat and nozzle cooling is an
important design problem. The cooling methods used are 1) regenerative cooling,
2) film cooling, 3) ablative cooling, and 4) radiation cooling.

Cooling
Fig. 4.40 Regenerative coolant flow.
Regenerative cooling is used on all large, launch vehicle engines. As shown
in Fig. 4.40, the nozzle construction is a bundle of shaped cooling tubes brazed
together and radially reinforced. The fuel is routed through the tubes from the exit
plane up to the injector. The energy collected from the gas stream in cooling is
returned to the combustion process by the hot fuel as it enters the chamber; hence,
the process is regenerative.
Film cooling is used in all engines as a supplement to the primary cooling
method. A cylindrical film of fuel is injected into the chamber such that it washes
down the wall. The flow is designed so that some liquid will reach the throat.
Cooling comes from the heat of vaporization of the fuel. Combustion near the wall
is fuel rich and inefficient; therefore, specific impulse is reduced, and the amount
of fuel used in film cooling is minimized in engine designs.
In ablative cooling the chamber wall is constructed of material that will be evap-
orated and eroded away during the firing. Typically the throat will be a machined
carbon block to prevent throat erosion. Ablative cooling takes place primarily
in the combustion chamber and diverging section, which are usually a fiberglass
epoxy material. The material thickness is sized so that the expected burn time will
remove an allowable amount of material.
For radiation cooling the chamber is made of a refractory material and radiative
heat rejection to space plus enhanced film cooling keeps the chamber walls within
acceptable limits.
4.5.2 Bipropellants
In Goddard's early work with rockets, he chose liquid oxygen and kerosene for
their availability and performance. When the Germans started their work with rock-
ets, they chose oxygen but elected to use alcohol as the fuel because of a scarcity
of petroleum. After World War II, when the work returned to the United States,
kerosene came back as the fuel and was renamed RP-1 (Rocket Propellant 1).
Liquid oxygen was not a good choice for strategic weapons because of the dif-
ficulty storing it under field conditions. As a result "storable propellants" were
developed by the U.S. Air Force. Nitric acid was used as an oxidizer in very
early work; however, in the 1960s the U.S. Air Force selected less corrosive ni-
trogen tetroxide for the oxidizer. The fuels most seriously studied were hydrazine

and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). Hydrazine was less stable but
it delivered higher 7sp. The final selection for the U.S. Air Force launch vehicle
program was a 50/50 mixture of hydrazine and UDMH. This combination, named
Aerozine 50, was first used in Titan II and is the Titan propellant combination to
this day. In later developments the storable fuel of choice became monomethylhy-
drazine (MMH), which has the properties of Aerozine 50 without the problems of
mixing.
Meanwhile NASA, with its need for heavy launch vehicles, developed Saturn
series (Saturn 1, IB, 5) with oxygen/hydrogen. The Space Shuttle, in turn, was de-
veloped with this combination. Research persisted with the more energetic fluorine
oxidizer and derivatives like chlorine triflouride; these were eventually dropped
because of the difficulty of containing fluorine in metal tanks. The properties of
some propellants are shown in Table 4.13.
Fluorine, oxygen, and hydrogen are called cryogenics because of the extremely
low temperatures at which they are liquids. There is a body of technology associated
with the use of cryogenics that will not be covered in this text. As one example,
note that a liquid hydrogen tank must be insulated in such a way that air cannot
penetrate the insulation. If air penetrates to the tank wall and approaches liquid
hydrogen temperatures, it will liquefy with resulting very high heat transfer to the
hydrogen. As another example, if a cryogenic is allowed to warm in a long vertical
feed line it will form sudden large bubbles as it reaches the boiling point. These
bubbles will coalesce and rise through the liquid with destructive force; this series
of events is called geysering. One cure for geysering is to inject gaseous helium
into the cryogenic, then the cryogenic rapidly evaporates into the helium bubble
seeking to reach a saturated vapor state; the result is rapid cooling of the cryogenic.
Studies of the use of cryogenics in spacecraft have been conducted with the hope

PROPULSION 213
of using the cold temperatures achievable in space for cryogenic storage; however,
cryogenics have never been used for anything other than launch vehicles.
4.5.2. 1 Nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). Nitrogen tetroxide is an equilibrium
solution of nitrogen dioxide NO2 and nitrogen tetroxide ^04. The equilibrium
state varies with temperature. It is a relative of nitric acid, which it smells like. It
is reddish brown and very toxic. It is hypergolic (ignites spontaneously on con-
tact) with hydrazine, Aerozine 50, and MMH; therefore, igniters are not required.
This property makes pulsing performance practical with storable propellants. It is
compatible with stainless steel, aluminum, and Teflon®; it is incompatible with
virtually all elastomers.
4.5.2.2 Monomethylhydrazine (MMH). MMH is a clear water- white toxic
liquid. It has a sharp decaying fish smell typical of amines. It is not sensitive to
impact or friction; it is more stable than hydrazine when heated, but decomposes
with catalytic oxidation. Nitrogen tetroxide and MMH is the dominant spacecraft
propellant combination for bipropellant spacecraft propulsion. However recent
planetary spacecraft have used hydrazine fuel in dual-mode systems, which will
be discussed later.
4.5.2.3 Hydrazine (tyH^. The advent of dual-mode propulsion systems
in the 1990s brought hydrazine to the forefront as the spacecraft fuel of choice. It
provides slightly higher 7sp with nitrogen tetroxide than MMH and can be used as
a monopropellant for pulsing. The properties of hydrazine were covered in detail
in Section 4.4.
4.5.3 Bipropellant Fluid Systems
Pressurization, propellant systems, and tankage were discussed in Section 4.4.;
these discussions are equally applicable to bipropellant systems. Only the pecu-
liarities of bipropellant systems will be discussed here.
4. 5. 3. 1 Propellant inventory. The propellant inventory is a subdivided tab-
ulation of the loaded propellant weight. In preparation of a bipropellant inven-
tory, the usable propellant is first subdivided into oxidizer and fuel. By definition,
mixture ratio is
MR=— (4.84)wf
where w0 is the oxidizer weight flow rate and Wf the fuel weight flow rate. Nitrogen
tetroxide and MMH are a commonly used mixture ratio of about 1.6. Rearranging
Eq. (4.84) produces an expression for separating usable propellant into oxidizer
and fuel:

w< = iri^ (4-85)

where
Wu = total (oxidizer and fuel) usable propellant weight, kg
Wf = total usable fuel load, kg
W0 = total usable oxidizer load, kg
Table 4.14 shows an example propellant inventory for 1000 kg of usable propellant
at a mixture ratio of 1.6.
The usable propellant is that portion of the propellant loaded which is actually
burned. Not all of the propellant loaded can be used; a certain amount is trapped,
drop out, or loading uncertainty. Trapped propellant is the propellant remaining in
the feed lines, tanks and valves, hold up in expulsion devices and retained vapor
left in the system with the pressurizing gas. Trapped propellant is about 3% of the
usable propellant in small bipropellant systems.
The two primary activities that dictate the required usable propellant are 1) the
propellant required for velocity change maneuvers as dictated by the mission de-
sign and 2) the propellant required to control attitude. The Tsiolkowski equations
give usable propellant for velocity change maneuvers. For example, it takes a
velocity change of about 2.25 km/s to move a spacecraft from a parking orbit
to a geosynchronous orbit; the propellant for this maneuver is velocity change
propellant Attitude control propellant is required for duty-cycle operation, wheel
unloading, or spacecraft pointing. A given project can separate usable propellant
into these functions in the propellant inventory.
Outage is caused by the difference between the mixture ratio loaded and the
mixture ratio at which the engine actually burned. There is always some of one
propellant left when the other propellant is depleted; the remaining propellant
is called outage. Outage depends on loading accuracy and on the burn-to-burn
repeatability of engine mixture ratio. One percent outage can be used for initial
estimates; however, it takes statistical engine data and loading data to make an
informed estimate.
Some design groups calculate the propellant requirements under nominal condi-
tions. If this is done, it is necessary to calculate the additional propellant necessary
to do the mission under worst-case conditions and show this in the propellant in-
ventory. The most common practice is to calculate the propellant requirements
using worst-case conditions and show that in the propellant inventory as just
stated.
Propellant reserves can be shown as a separate item in the propellant inventory.
Propellant reserves are a very valuable commodity. The more of the project reserves

<<<PAGE 227>>>

PROPULSION 215
placed in propellant the better; there are three primary reasons for this: 1) propellant
is usually the life-limiting expendable; 2) it is often desirable to make unplanned
maneuvers in emergency conditions; and 3) there are usually extended mission
objectives that can be achieved after the primary mission—if there is propellant.
If reserves are held, these are itemized as a subdivision of usable propellant.
The measurement uncertainty in propellant loading is about 0.5%. The uncer-
tainty is added to the load to ensure that the usable propellant can be no less than
worst-case requirement.
Drop out (launch vehicle systems only) is the propellant left in the feed line
when the propellant surface in the tank drops into the line.
4.5.3.2 Propellant control and tankage. Titanium, aluminum, and stain-
less steel are compatible with both nitrogen tetroxide and the hydrazines, and are
the tank materials used. Titanium is the lightest and most common. The maxi-
mum performance mixture ratio and the equal volume mixture ratio are so close
that it is sometimes possible to use identical tank shells for oxidizer and fuel as a
cost-saving measure.
Nitrogen tetroxide is not compatible with elastomers; as a result, the propellant
control devices are limited to metals and Teflon®. Bellows, capillaries, and Teflon®
bladders have been used; see Fig. 4.23.
The Space Shuttle RCS chose titanium tanks with complex stainless-steel capil-
lary systems. These were discussed in Section 4.4 and shown in Fig. 4.24. Mariner
9 and Transtage chose Teflon® bladders. In each case the propellant control device
choice was driven by the oxidizer but used in both oxidizer and fuel tanks.
The Minuteman postboost propulsion system used a stainless-steel bellows as-
sembly to control propellant position and to accommodate long-term propellant
storage. Minuteman, like most other projects, decided to make both oxidizer and
fuel tanks essentially identical.
4.5.3.3 Pressurization. Blowdown pressurization has not been used with
bipropellants because of 1) the difficulty in keeping both tanks at the same pressure
and 2) difficulties with varying inlet pressure to bipropellant engines. Either helium
or nitrogen systems are used, although helium is the most frequent choice. A
typical, simplified, bipropellant pressurization system is shown in Fig. 4.41.
A regulated system controls the pressure in the propellant tanks at a preset
pressure. The pressurant (pressurizing gas) is stored at a high pressure—21,000-
34,500 kPa (3,000-5,000 psi). The engine is supplied propellant at a tightly
controlled lower pressure and flow rate. Thrust does not vary during propellant
consumption. For bipropellant systems regulation is essential in order to keep the
flow rate of each propellant constant and at the correct mixture ratio.
The pressurant tank weight is essentially constant for any initial pressure for a
given gas weight, for example, it takes about 3.2 kg (7 Ib) of tank to contain 1 Ib
of helium. Thus, the initial storage pressure selected is a second-order trade. A
regulator requires an inlet pressure around 100 psi higher than the outlet pressure
in order to operate properly. Therefore, the unusable pressurant is trapped in the
pressurant tank at or above the minimum regulator inlet pressure. A typical pressure
profile for a regulated system is as follows:

The minimum ullage volume must be about 3% of the propellant tank volume in
order for the regulator to have a stable response when outflow starts. In addition to
the pressure regulator, relief valves are necessary to protect the tank in case the
regulator fails open. It is good practice to place a burst disk upstream of the relief
valve so that pressurant is not lost overboard at the valve seat leakage rate. This
precaution is particularly important if helium is the pressurant. For bipropellant
systems each propellant tank ullage must be isolated to prevent vapor mixing.
For constant temperature conditions the volume of the pressurant sphere is
PrVu(4.87)
where Vs is the volume of pressurant sphere, Pr the regulated propellant tank
pressure, Vu the volume of the usable propellant (both), P\ the initial pressurant
sphere pressure, and P^ the final pressurant sphere pressure.
Once the volume of the pressurant sphere is calculated, the initial weight of the
stored pressurant can be calculated from the equation of state. The total weight of

the pressurant on board is the initial weight of pressurant in the sphere plus the
initial weight of pressurant in each tank ullage. (The initial pressurant in the ullage
is normally supplied from ground sources.)
Note from Eq. (4.87) that the sphere volume, and hence weight, is independent
of the pressurizing gas chosen.

The total weight of the helium on board at launch is 8.257 kg.
Careful consideration should be given to propellant vapor mixing between the
check valves after permeation of the check valve seals. Regulator leakage occurred
as Viking 1 neared Mars, caused by an obstruction on the valve seat. The spacecraft
orbit insertion was successfully accomplished in spite of the leak as was the re-
mainder of the multiyear mission. The leakage was exhaustively investigated. The
probable cause was propellant vapor mixing between the check valves. The same
phenomena was the most probable cause of the recent total failure of the Mars
Observer. Positive mixing prevention is particularly important on long duration
missions.

4.5.3.4 Unusable propellant. The unusable propellant is greater with bi-
propellant systems than monopropellant systems. The difference between loaded
mixture ratio and burned mixture ratio results in residual of one or the other
commodities. This residual is called outage. The unusable propellant is about 4%
of the total load by weight.
4.5.3.5 Pulsing performance. Sutton2 states that an 7sp of 50% of the-
oretical can be expected with a bipropellant engine producing 0.01-s pulses (as
compared to steady state of 92%). With 0.1-s pulses 75 to 85% can be excepted.
Reference 9 gives a pulsing 7sp for bipropellant engines of 170 s. Transtage motor
testing with 0.02-s pulses indicates a delivered /sp of 128 s or 45% of steady state
for a 25-Ib engine and a delivered 7sp of 191 s or 65% of steady state for a 45-Ib
engine. Transtage engine firings produced an impulse repeatability of +/—10%
pulse to pulse and +/—30% engine to engine.
4.5-4 Flight Bipropellant Systems
Five spacecraft bipropellant systems with a successful flight history are summa-
rized in Table 4.15. The systems are arranged in the order of first flight to show the
progression of technology. The three most recent systems—Galileo, INTELSAT
VI, and Mars Global Surveyor—are described in this section.
4.5.4.1 Galileo. Galileo is the next step in the exploration of Jupiter fol-
lowing the flyby missions of Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1 and 2. The Galileo
mission is to find out more about the chemical composition and physical state of
the atmosphere and to study the satellites of Jupiter. The spacecraft is a dual-spin
orbiter and an attached probe. Galileo was the second interplanetary spacecraft to
be launched on the shuttle, following the Magellan flight in 1989.
The Galileo propulsion system is a highly redundant bipropellant MMH/nitrogen
tetroxide system shown in Fig. 4.42.
The system provides midcourse corrections, orbit adjustments, and Jupiter orbit
insertion, which occurs after release of the probe. Maneuvering propulsion is
accomplished with a single 400-N main engine; attitude control is provided with
two clusters of six 10-N thrusters. The two clusters are on opposing booms. The
400-N engine can be fired for up to 70 min; the 10-N thrusters can be used in pulse
mode or steady state. The minimum impulse bit is 0.09 N-s with an on time of 22
ms. The 10-N thrusters can back up the 400-N engine in the event of a failure. Three
parallel supply branches feed propellant to the two redundant thruster branches
and to the 400-N engine. Dual helium tanks provide helium for the regulated
pressurization of the four propellant tanks. Special low leakage check valves were
designed to prevent propellant vapor mixing between the two check valves.
The Galileo propulsion system was designed by MBB and was provided to Jet
Propulsion Laboratory/NASA by Germany.
4.5.4.2 INTELSAT VI. The INTELSAT VI spacecraft are the latest in a long
line of INTELSAT communication satellites; the first satellite of the series was
launched in October 1989. The propulsion system, shown in Fig. 4.43, supplies
thrust for apogee injection (replacing a kick motor) and orbital adjustments.

The system consists of two functionally independent half-systems connected by
latch valves on the liquid side and normally open squib valves on the pressurant
side. Each half-system can perform all of the propulsion functions required for
spacecraft operation. Individual fuel and oxidizer tanks can be isolated on the
pressurant side to prevent propellant migration. Two 490-N liquid apogee motors
(LAMs) provide the impulse for geosynchronous orbit insertion and spacecraft
reorientation during the orbit-transfer portion of the mission. The LAMs are located
in the aft end of the spin-stabilized spacecraft and are used in steady state or pulse
mode. Six 22.2-N reaction control thrusters are used for control functions. Two
are used for axial impulse and are located at the aft end of the spacecraft near
the LAMs. Four thrusters are located radially on the spun shelf and are used for
spin up and spin down. The thrusters also provide impulse precession, orbit trim,
nutation control, north-south stationkeeping and east-west station change, and
deorbit control. The thrusters are separated into two redundant groups.
Helium pressurization is supplied through series redundant regulators. Eight
propellant tanks are symmetrically located around the center of mass. Both the

oxidizer and fuel tanks are manifolded to maintain spacecraft balance. Centrifugal
forces from spinning provide propellant position control; no propellant manage-
ment device is necessary.
The propellants and pressurant are launched isolated by latching valves and
pyrovalves. Initial orientation and control is provided by the 22.2-N thrusters in the
blowdown mode. The pressurization system is opened for the apogee burn. After
the apogee burn and trim maneuvers the LAMs are isolated from the propellant
supply by closing the isolation latch valves (FLV4 and 5 and OLV4 and 5) to
preclude leakage failure. Some time after LAM isolation, the pressurization system
is sealed, and oxidizer and fuel systems are isolated to prevent propellant vapor
mixing or propellant migration. After isolation the system operates in blowdown
mode for the remainder of the mission. Mixture ratio can be controlled during
blowdown by operating FSV1 and OSVI.24
The INTELSAT VI propulsion system was designed by Hughes Space and
Communications Company under contract to International Telecommunication
Satellite Organization (INTELSAT). Five INTELSAT VI spacecraft were launched;
each propulsion system performed satisfactorily.
4.6 Dual-Mode Systems
Many missions require a high-impulse velocity change burn as well as pulse
mode attitude control operation. For example, a planetary orbiter requires a high-
impulse single burn for orbit insertion and pulse mode for attitude control.
Geosynchronous spacecraft also require a high-impulse burn to establish the re-
quired orbit as well as pulsing performance for ACS. Magellan used a solid motor
for orbit insertion and a monopropellant system for pulse mode and small transla-
tion burns. Galileo used a bipropellant system for high-impulse burns and for pulse
mode operation. Viking Orbiter used a MMH/N2O4 bipropellant system for orbit
insertion and trajectory correction maneuvers and a cold-gas system for attitude
control. Geosynchronous orbiters commonly use a solid motor for orbit insertion
and a monopropellant system for ACS. There is a new technology that promises
a better solution by using hydrazine as bipropellant fuel, replacing monomethyl
hydrazine, and also as a monopropellant for pulsing. This is called the dual-mode
system. The system is shown schematically in Fig. 4.44.
The advantages of the dual-mode system are 1) the ability to use the hydrazine
as a monopropellant in attitude control thrusters and as the fuel in bipropellant
main engines with resulting system simplification, and 2) a significant increase
in 7sp for the orbit insertion burn. A typical solid motor delivers an /sp of 290 s;
the dual-mode bipropellant system delivers about 317 s. The dual-mode system is
used on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft launched in 1996. It will also fly in
upcoming communication satellites and planetary missions.
As you can see from Fig. 4.44, the detailed design aspects of the bipropellant half
of the system are as discussed in Section 4.5; the details of the monopropellant half
of the system are as described in Section 4.4. In this section the features peculiar
to dual-mode operation are shown by a flight system example.
The Mars Global Surveyor, launched in 1996, is a significant element of the
NASA overall strategy for the exploration of Mars over the next decade. It is also
one of the first spacecraft to use the dual-mode system. The propulsion system,

shown in Fig. 4.45, provides Mars orbit insertion, attitude control pulsing, and a
number of orbit trim maneuvers.
The orbit insertion burn was accomplished by the single 490-N bipropellant
velocity control thruster. Thrust vector control, orbit trim, and attitude control
maneuvers are accomplished by 12 4.45-N thrusters. The system uses three iden-
tical titanium barrel tanks (two fuel, one oxidizer) with capillary vane propellant
positioning systems similar to those used on Viking Orbiter. The total propellant
load is 386 kg. First pulse problems for attitude control are prevented by launching
with propellant loaded to the thruster valves.
The system contains 1.36 kg of helium stored at 25,510 kPa. Vapor migration is
prevented by a ladder of pyrovalves in the oxidizer pressurization line, which allow
the oxidizer tank to be isolated between bipropellant burns. Specially designed,
low vapor leak, quad-redundant, check valves are used in the pressurization system
to reduce vapor migration during periods when the pyro valves are open.
The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft was designed by Lockheed Martin under
contract with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

bum in place. Solid rocket systems are used extensively in situations where 1)
the total impulse requirement is known accurately in advance and 2) restart is
not required. Boosters for Titan IV and the Space Shuttle are good examples
of such a situation. Spacecraft examples are the kick stage for a geosynchronous
orbiter and the orbit insertion motor for a planetary orbiter. Solid motors are used in
applications requiring impulse as small as 196,000 N-s (Explorer I motor) up to the
1.45 billion N-s (one shuttle booster motor). Sizes range from 15 cm diam to 6.6 m.
The elements of a solid rocket motor are shown in Fig. 4.46 and discussed in
subsequent sections of this chapter.
4.7.1 Propellents
Solid rockets are over 700 years old, having been used by the Chinese in 1232.
The basis of Chinese rockets was ordinary black powder, the gun powder of muzzle
loaders. Smokeless powder was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1879, but it was

PROPULSION 225
IGNITER - The function of the igniter is to raise the grain
surface temperature to the ignition point and to increase
chamber pressure to self sustaining levels.
INSULATION - Most solid rocket motors have areas of
exposed case which require insulation to protect the case
from combustion gas. The insulated areas are typically at
the ends of the grain.
GRAIN - The solid propellant, regardless of configuration,
is called a grain when installed in a motor, The central
opening in the grain Is called the port. A typical grain
consists of a rubber-like binder, aluminum powder,
ammonium perchlorate and additives.
CASE - The case is the pressure shell. Titanium, mild steel
and Kevlarare used.
LINER - Liner is used at the propellant-case joint. The
purpose of the liner is to inhibit grain burning and insulate
the case when the flame front arrives. The liner is usually
propellant binder.
NOZZLE -The nozzle provides the converging- diverging
section which accelerates the exhaust gas. The design
challenge in the nozzle is the high temperatures which are
reached. The usual construction is graphite epoxy or
carbon-carbon with a carbon throat.
NOZZLE CLOSURE - The nozzle closure protects the grain
from exposure to hard vacuum.

not used as solid rocket fuel until Goddard tried it in 1918. He concluded that
liquid propellants would be the best development path for space work, and his
conclusion held true for 50 years. Double-base propellant, which is the interesting
combination of nitrocellulose dissolved in nitroglycerin, was used for a time, and
combinations of composite and double-based propellants have been used. Modern,
high-performance, solid rockets were made possible in 1942 when the Jet Propul-
sion Laboratory introduced the first composite propellant. By 1960 composite
propellants were the industry standard.

226 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
Composite propellants are composed of one of several organic binders, alu-
minum powder and an oxidizer, which is nearly always ammonium perchlorate
(NFLjClOzO. The binders are rubber-like polymers, which serve a dual purpose as
fuel and, in addition, bind the ammonium perchlorate and aluminum powders into
a solid capable of being shaped into a grain. Two common binders are hydroxy
terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), which is used in the Thiokol Star series of
motors, and polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN), which is used in the Titan solid
rocket motors.
Composites also contain small amounts of chemical additives to improve vari-
ous physical properties, for example, improve burn rate, promote smooth burning
(flash depressor), improve casting characteristics, improve structural properties
(plasticizer), and absorb moisture during storage (stabilizer).
In general, solid propellants produce vacuum specific impulse of 300 s or
lower, somewhat lower than bipropellants. Solid-propellant densities, however,
are higher, resulting in smaller systems for a given impulse. As higher spe-
cific impulse is sought, less stable ingredients, such as boron and nitronium
perchlorate, are necessary. The characteristics of some propellants are shown in
Table 4.16.
4.7.1.1 Hazard classification. Propellants are divided into two explosive
hazard designations by DOD and DOT: 1) class 2 (or DOT class B)—catastrophic
failure produces burning or explosion (most motors) and 2) DOD class 7 (or DOT
class A)—catastrophic failure produces detonation (uncommon). The motor clas-
sification dictates the safety requirements for using and handling the motor. A
class 2 motor is obviously the least expensive motor to transport and handle.
4.7.1.2 Burning rate. Control of the exhaust gas flow rate is achieved, not
by precise metering of propellant flows as in a liquid system, but by precise control
of the exposed grain surface area and the burning rate of the propellant mixture.
The solid is transformed into combustion gases at the grain surface. The surface
regresses normal to itself in parallel layers; the rate of regression is called the
burning rate. Burning rate can be measured by measuring flame front velocity on
a strand (Fig. 4.47).
wp = p Ap r (4.88)
where wp is the combustion gas flow rate, kg/s; p the gas density, kg/cc; Ap the
surface area of burning propellant, cm2; and r the burning rate, speed at which the
flame front is progressing, cm/s.
Pressure effect. Because grain density is essentially constant during a burn,
gas flow rate is controlled by grain area and burning rate. Gas flow rate, thrust, and
chamber pressure go up with an increase in burning area. Also burning rate goes
up exponentially with pressure:
r = cPn (4.89)
where n and c are empirical constants.
Temperature effect. Chamber pressure increases nonlinearly with grain tem-
perature because burning rate increases with temperature and pressure. Figure 4.48
shows the effect of grain initial temperature on chamber pressure and hence thrust.

The sensitivity of chamber pressure to temperature is typically 0.12 to 0.50%
per °C.
Spacecraft motor temperature is carefully controlled for two reasons: 1) to limit
variation in performance and 2) to minimize thermal stress in the grain and hence
minimize the possibility of grain cracks. A typical temperature control range is 15°
to 38°C; the control range can be tightened before the motor firing. Magellan used
electrical heaters, thermostats, and insulation to control the motor temperature.
Acceleration effect. Burning rate is increased by acceleration perpendicular to
the burning surface, a phenomena of particular interest in the design of spinning
spacecraft.24 Acceleration in the range of 30 g can double the burn rate. The
enhancement of burning rate has been observed for acceleration vectors at any
angle of 60 to 90 deg. with the burning surface. The increase in burning rate is
attributed to the presence of molten metal and metal oxide particles that are retained
against the grain surface by the radial acceleration with an attendant increase in
heat transfer at the grain surface. The effect is enhanced by increased aluminum
concentration and particle size.25
4.7.1.3 Space storage. There is some controversy and little data regarding
the ability of a solid motor grain to withstand long periods of space exposure with an
open port. The concern is that evaporation could affect the chemical composition of
the propellant or bond line and affect performance. There are two options available:
1) conduct adequate testing to establish postvacuum performance, or 2) design a
sealed nozzle closure.
Most missions, kick stages and upper stages, entail only short-duration exposure.
These missions have been flown for years with no closure. A planetary mis-
sion, like Magellan, is another story. Thiokol Corporation space aging data26 for

TPH-3135 shows low risk for 10-month exposure. LDEF results26 indicate that 5.5-
year exposures may be acceptable. The Magellan mission itself shows (one data
point) that 15-month space vacuum exposure, without a nozzle plug, is acceptable.
4.7.2 Grains
In a solid motor the propellant tank and the combustion chamber are the same
vessel. The viscous propellant mixture is cast and cured in a mold to achieve the
desired shape and structural strength. After casting the propellant is referred to as
the grain. The most frequent method of casting is done in place in the motor case
using a mandrill to form the central port. When cast in this way, the grain is called
case bonded.
Grains can also be cast separately and loaded into the case at a later time; such
grains are called cartridge loaded. Large grains are cast in segments; the segments
are then stacked to form a motor. The motors for the Space Shuttle and Titan IV
are made in this way; Fig. 4.49 shows the segmented Space Shuttle motor.
Segmented grains solve the difficult motor transport problem; however, they also
require high-temperature case joints, which can be a serious failure source. The
aft field joint, shown in Fig. 4.49, was the cause of the Space Shuttle Challenger
explosion.27
Liner is used at the grain to case interface to inhibit burning as the flame front
arrives at the case wall. The liner composition is usually binder without added
propellants. In areas of the case where there is no grain interface, usually at the ends
of the motor, insulation is used to protect the case for the full duration of a firing.
4.7.2.1 Grain shape. Grain shape, primarily cross section, determines
the surface burning area as a function of time. Burning area, along with burn-
ing rate, determine thrust. For a given propellant, surface area vs time determines

the shape of the thrust time curve. A cylindrical grain inhibited on the sides, a
"cigarette burner" or "end burner," would have a constant burning area and a con-
stant thrust. A grain with an essentially constant burning surface area and thrust
time curve is called neutral burning. End-burning grains were used by the thou-
sands for JATO rockets in the 1940s.
A grain that has increasing surface area with time is called progressive. The pri-
mary disadvantage of progressive burning is that as the mass decreases the thrust
increases. The resulting loads on a spacecraft increase sharply with time, which is
not conducive to an efficient structure. A cylindrical grain inhibited at the ends and
burning from the sides would be regressive. Neutral burning is the most common
design for spacecraft. Grain cross sections are shown in Fig. 4.50.
A crack in the grain provides an unplanned increase in exposed area with a resul-
tant sudden increase in pressure, which can lead to failure. Numerous precautions
must be taken to prevent grain cracks; these include 1) limits on grain temperature
extremes, 2) limits on shock loads on the grain and bond line, and 3) a final set of
grain x rays at the launch site just before launch.
A star grain is the most commonly used shape and is nearly neutral. The pro-
gression of the burning surface in a star grain is as shown in Fig. 4.51. The flame

front does not reach the liner in all locations at the same time. When the flame front
first reaches the liner, chamber pressure starts to decay. At a given pressure aggres-
sive burning or deflagration can no longer occur. The residual, useable propellant,
which remains when combustion stops, called sliver. Sliver will be about 2% of
the grain weight.
4.7.2.2 Shelf life. The shelf life of a motor is a conservative estimate of
the acceptable length of time from the pour date to the firing date. A typical shelf
life is three years; therefore, the pour date must not be more than three years from
the on-mission firing. Thus the pour date becomes a major program milestone.
4.7.2.3 Offload capability. Many solid motors have been demonstrated to
perform properly over a range of propellant loads. This is called off-load capability
and is useful in the matching the required total impulse with the available total
impulse. Offloading is accomplished by pouring the motor case less than full. The
Star 48, for example, is normally loaded with 1997 kg of propellant; propellant
can be off loaded down to 1600 kg.
4.7.3 Thrust Control
A spacecraft must make provision to start and terminate thrust as well as align
the nominal vector through the center of mass and move the vector through small
angles for vehicle stability.
4.7.3.1 Ignition. During most of a spacecraft assembly and flight, the ob-
jective is to prevent solid motor ignition. During times when people are around the
motor, it is a common requirement for the ignition system to be two-fault tolerant.
The system must be designed such that unwanted ignition cannot occur after any
two conceivable failures. If the spacecraft is launched on the Space Shuttle, this
requirement is in effect until deployment. When ignition is required in the mission,
it is common to require single fault tolerance.
A typical solid rocket motor ignition system is shown schematically in Fig. 4.52.
It requires careful use of redundancy to meet the failure criteria just mentioned.
Redundancy is not shown in Fig. 4.52 in the interest of simplicity.

A typical ignition system consists of the following:
1) Squibs are cylinders that contain a small chemical charge so sensitive that the
heat from an electrical filament will cause a substantial energy release. The squibs
have an electrical connector, which receives the start signal. Squibs are required
to have a certain all-fire current and a certain no-fire current. The electrical fila-
ment is called a bridge wire. Some squibs have redundant bridge wires to receive
redundant signals.
2) The explosive transfer assembly (ETA) is an explosive train that runs from
the safe and arm to the igniter. An ETA has the same function as a dynamite fuse
but is much, much faster.
3) The safe and arm (S&A) is a dc motor that houses the squibs on one side and
the ETAs on the other with a rotating cylinder between. A section of the explosive
train is embedded in the rotating cylinder. The flame front that starts in the squibs
must pass through the cylinder to reach the ETAs. When the cylinder is rotated
to the safe position, as shown in Fig. 4.52, the train is interrupted. In the armed
position the train is continuous; the cylinder is rotated 90 deg from the position
shown in Fig. 4.52. There is a physical flag on the exterior of the S&A, which
shows position. In addition, there is a position signal sent to the command and
data system so that the position can be telemetered to the ground operations team.
It is typical to use dual S&As and dual igniters.
4) The igniter is similar to a small solid motor with a propellant mixture, which
is readily ignited. The igniter raises the pressure in the motor port and raises the
grain temperature to the ignition point.
At the appointed time the spacecraft command system sends the "arm" command
to a relay, which powers the S&A motor. (In the Magellan mission this point was
15 months after launch.) The S&A rotates and signals that the armed position has
been achieved.

The "fire" command is sent to a separate relay, which powers the squib bridge
wires lighting the explosives in the squib. The flame front progresses through the
S&A and the ETA and lights the motor igniters. The igniters bathe the grain surface
in flame and the motor ignites. From signal to grain ignition takes about 150 ms;
full thrust takes about another 50 ms.
4.7.3.2 Thrust vector control. Moving the net thrust vector through small
angles for vehicle stability and maneuvering is called thrust vector control (TVC).
The methods in common use are summarized in Table 4.17. All of the thrust vector
control schemes in Table 4.17, except jet vanes, require auxiliary equipment to
achieve roll control. All types can provide pitch and yaw control with a single
nozzle.
Jet vanes and Jetavators operate with low actuator power and provide high slew
rates; however, there is a thrust and 7sp loss of up to 2%. Jet vanes, Jetavators,
and movable nozzles, types 1 through 4 in Table 4.17, all require an actuator
system. Hydraulic and electromechanical actuator systems are used. The IUS uses
an electromechanical system consisting of the following.
1) A controller which receives analog pitch and yaw commands from the guid-
ance system. The analog signals are converted into pulse-width modulated voltages
for the actuator motors.
2) Actuator control motors (one pitch, one yaw), which drive the ball screw
mechanisms.
3) A ball screw mechanism, which positions the nozzle (one pitch, one yaw)
The most common TVC methods are movable nozzles and fluid injection, types
3, 4, and 5 in Table 4.17. Figure 4.53 shows the Space Shuttle solid motor nozzle
incorporating gimbaled movement with an flexible bearing nozzle.
A flexible bearing movable nozzle has no hot moving parts and provides repeat-
able, albeit high, actuator forces.
The fluid injection systems inject a liquid into the nozzle, which causes an
oblique shock in the exhaust stream deflecting the thrust vector as shown in
Fig. 4.54. The thrust vector is diverted in the direction opposite the injection
point.
The advantages of a liquid injection system are high slew rate and increased
motor performance. The increased performance can essentially offset the
added weight. The disadvantage is the additional equipment required and the liquid
propellant required. The Titan III and IV, stage 0, solid rocket motors use liquid

injection; nitrogen tetroxide is used as the injectant. The fluid system is shown in
Fig. 4.55.
The pyroseal valve shown in Fig. 4.55 seals the injectant prior to ignition. At
ignition the exhaust melts the exposed end of the valve allowing injectant flow.
The TVC injectant tank on either of the two Titan IV, stage 0, rocket motors is
bigger than the V-2.
An alternative approach to controlling the motor thrust vector is to provide an
auxiliary propulsion system to stabilize the spacecraft. This was the approach used
by Magellan. The monopropellant attitude control system was designed to provide
three-axis control with or without the solid motor firing. Redundant, aft-facing
445-N thrusters provided pitch and yaw control during the firing. The system also
provided vernier impulse adjustment after solid motor shut down.

4.7.3.3 Thrust vector alignment. For three-axis stabilized spacecraft the
solid motor must be installed with the thrust vector accurately aligned with the
spacecraft center of mass. The severity of this requirement depends on the magni-
tude of attitude control authority, the accuracy of e.g. location and the accuracy of
the thrust vector location. For a geometrically perfect nozzle the thrust vector lies
on the centerline. The thrust vector is very nearly on the centerline in real nozzles
as shown in Table 4.18, for the STAR48B™ solid motor.
The shape and size of the nozzle changes during the burn. The resulting variation
in thrust vector location is more difficult to determine. The center of mass of a
motor moves during the burning process; the tolerance about nominal movement
is also difficult to determine.
In the Magellan spacecraft design it was necessary to use 8 Ib of ballast to bring
the center of mass to within the required 0.02 in. of the predicted thrust vector
location. It is difficult to obtain an actual spacecraft center of mass. It must be

done late in the process at the launch site, and even then certain equipment will
not be installed; for example, liquid propellants will not be loaded, the solid motor
will be represented by an inert motor, igniters will not be installed, and remove
before flight equipment will still be installed A spin-stabilized spacecraft avoids
this set of problems because rotation nullifies thrust vector alignment errors.
4.7.3.4 Thrust termination. Thrust termination is desirable because the
delivered impulse cannot be predicted exactly. Delivered impulse depends on the
temperature of the grain, the actual propellant weight, the exact composition, and
the weight of inert parts consumed. Thrust termination allows a spacecraft to
measure velocity gained and shut down when the desired velocity is reached. The
impulse uncertainty with thrust termination is reduced to the shutdown impulse
uncertainty. Table 4.19 lists demonstrated thrust termination methods.
Thrust termination can be done by suddenly reducing chamber pressure below
certain limits, quenching the combustion, or nullifying thrust. Titan, for example,
terminates stage 0 thrust by blowing out forward ports. Magellan and the Space
Shuttle are designed so that thrust termination is not required. In both of these
cases the solid motor burns out before the desired impulse is achieved. The deficit
is made up by liquid engines, which can be readily shut down on command.
4.7.4 Mounting
There are myriad mounting provisions for solid rocket motors. Spacecraft loads
can be carried through the case (IUS motor), or spacecraft loads can be carried
around the motor (Magellan). Mounting pads (Space Shuttle) or mounting rings
(IUS) can be used. Mounting pads carry a point load, and an interface truss is
desirable. Mounting rings carry a distributed load, and an interfacing shell struc-
ture is desirable. For large spacecraft motors the dominant mounting design is a
mounting ring. Figure 4.56 shows the Magellan SRM adapter structure designed
to mount the STAR48B™.
The SRM adapter structure attaches at the forward mounting ring of the
STAR48B™. The adapter is a conical aluminum honeycomb structure, which
mates with a truss the Magellan central structures.
After burnout it is desirable to jettison the spent motor case and as much support
structure as possible in order to reduce vehicle mass. Reduced mass reduces the
energy required by the attitude control system and reduces the energy required for
any subsequent maneuvering. There are two basic system types used for jettisoning:
1) linear shaped charge and 2) explosive bolts or nuts. Linear shaped charges are

used to cut all of the way around the girth of a shell structure. The freed motor
case and attached structure are pushed away by springs or by gas from the linear
charge.
Explosive nuts (or bolts) release a bolted joint in the structure releasing the spent
motor and support structure. The Magellan design used explosive nuts. In Fig. 4.56
the separation plane is between the main structure and the SRM adapter. This joint
is held together by explosive bolts. When the bolts are blown, the spent Star 48B and
the SRM adapter structure are pushed away with springs. The resultant reduction
in spacecraft mass was 163 kg.
4.7.5 Performance
Solid motor performance calculation must be approached somewhat differently
than liquid system performance as detailed in this section.
4.7.5.1 Burning time and action time. Burning time and action time for
a solid rocket motor can be estimated from internal ballistics using strand burning
rates or measured on a test stand. There are two times of interest, as shown in
Fig. 4.57: 1) the burning time, which is measured starting from 10% thrust at
ignition to 90% thrust during shutdown, and 2) the action time, which is measured
starting at 10% thrust during ignition to 10% thrust during shutdown. (The thrust
level from which the 10 and 90% points are calculated is the maximum thrust
level.) The 90% thrust point on shutdown is the approximate time when the flame
front reaches the inhibitor at the case wall. From the 90% point down to the 10%
point, the slivers are being consumed (less efficiently than the combustion at full
chamber pressure).

For a motor firing in a vacuum, thrust will continue for a substantial period of
time after the 10% thrust point on shutdown. During this tail-off period, a low
chamber pressure is maintained by burning of sliver, outgassing of inert materials,
and low level smoldering of hot insulation, nozzle materials and liner. The im-
pulse, thrust level, and time-to-zero thrust are nearly impossible to measure in the
atmosphere because a hard vacuum cannot be maintained with a motor outgassing.
It is very important in the design of the spent case staging sequence to provide an
adequate period before release in order to make sure the case will not follow the
spacecraft.
4.7.5.2. Effective propellant weight. The effective propellant weight is the
propellant actually consumed by the motor. Effective propellant is the difference
between the initial total weight of the motor and the post burn total weight of the
motor:
=Wt-W f (4.90)
Effective propellant weight can be either more or less than the total propellant load.
There are two effects at work: 1) sliver, which tends to reduce effective propellant,
and 2) consumed inert parts, which tend to increase effective propellant. Con-
sumed inert weights are nozzle materials that ablate, particularly in the throat area,
as well as volatiles forced out of the insulation and liner. In a vacuum motor it is very
likely that the sliver is consumed during the shutdown or tail off; thus, spacecraft
motors usually have an effective weight greater than the total propellant loaded.
Table 4.20 shows two examples.

4. 7.5.3 Impulse. Two impulse values result from the two thrust times just
described. If thrust is integrated from time zero to time = tb, the resulting impulse
4 is called burning time impulse:
Ib= I" Fdt (4.91)
Jo
If action time is used Ia, action time impulse results:
Ia= [ f' Fdt (4.92)
Jo
Action impulse is often called total impulse, which is true in the sense that the tail-
off impulse is essentially unusable. However, the tail-off impulse must be provided
for as just noted.
4. 7. 5. 4 Thrust. Two versions of time-average thrust arise from the preced-
ing dual- time standard:
Fb = ~ (4.93)tb
where ta is the action time, s; Ib the burning time total impulse, N-s; and Ia the
action time total impulse, N-s.
The burn time average thrust Fb is the most often used and is frequently referred
to simply (and imprecisely) as average thrust. Maximum thrust is critical to the
design of the case. It is calculated from internal ballistics for a hot grain using
maximum burning rate.
4.7.5.5 Specific impulse. Theoretical specific impulse for the propellant
can be calculated from theoretical thermodynamic properties as described in
Section 4.2. Propellant 7sp can also be obtained from thrust time test data
because
/sP - —— (4.94)
where 7sp is the propellant specific impulse, s; wp the propellant weight loaded,
kg; and gc the gravitational constant, 9.80665. In calculating propellant 7sp from
Eq. (4.96), the loaded propellant weight is used.

4.7.5.6 Motor weight. The total weight of a solid rocket motor can be

where W is the total motor weight, kg and r] the propellant mass fraction, W/wp.
The total weight of 23 spacecraft solid rocket motors of current design is shown
in Fig. 4.57 as a function of total impulse. For these motors the average propellant
7sp is 290.
Figure 4.58 shows that the average propellant mass fraction of these 23 current
motors is 0.93 with a correlation coefficient of 0.954. The results of Fig. 4.58 can
be expressed in a useful equation form
W =Wp
093(4.96)
where wp is propellant weight and W is the total motor weight.
Example 4.11 Solid Motor Performance, Size,
and Mass
Very frequently it is necessary to derive solid motor characteristics from the
top down from the requirements of a mission. For example, given the following
mission requirements what would the solid motor size, weight, and total impulse be
(the key parameter in motor selection is total impulse): required velocity change
is 1.831 km/s, and maximum spacecraft weight at burnout (including the spent
solid motor) is 1500 kg, (3307 Ib). (These are typical geosynchronous spacecraft
requirements.)
It is fair to assume that today's solid motor technology will yield a specific im-
pulse of about 290 s. From the Tsiolkowski equation (4.21), the expected propellant
weight would be
wP = (1500) | exp"(1.831)(3280.84)"[
_ (32.1741)(290) J- 1 = 1356 kg (2989 Ib)

<<<PAGE 253>>>

PROPULSION 241
The total impulse of the motor is
/ = wpl^gc = (1356)(290)(9.8066) = 3,856,347 N-s (866,950 Ib-s)
Assuming a mass fraction of 0.93, the motor total weight will be about
W = ^ = 1458 kg (3214 Ib)
The weight available for the spacecraft bus is 1500 - (1458 - 1356) = 1398kg
(3082 Ib).
Motor volume can be obtained from the volumetric loading fraction, which is
the ratio of the propellant volume to the motor volume excluding the nozzle. A
volumetric loading fraction of 90% is typical for a spacecraft motor. A typical
propellant density is 1770 kg/m3 from Table 4.18:
Vm = ~pV~f ~ (1770)(0.90) ~ ' m
4.7.6 Selecting a Solid Motor
It would be highly unusual to develop a custom solid motor for a spacecraft.
In practice a motor is selected from the wide array of off-the-shelf motors offered
by the industry. "Off the shelf" means that the design, manufacturing processes,
tooling and test equipment exist, have been qualified, and motors have a flight
history. It does not mean that motors are immediately available in a warehouse.
The flight motor will be poured specifically for the program.
The key parameter in the selection of a solid motor is the total impulse re-
quirement for the mission. The industry now offers solid motors for almost any
total impulse starting with a few hundred newtons-second and going up to the
1.4 billion N-s supplied by each Space Shuttle booster rocket. Many solid motors
are designed to be offloaded slightly; thus, motors can be tailored somewhat to
fit the desired total impulse. The spacecraft design can also be tailored to fit the
motor. For example, Magellan was designed to fit the STAR48 by providing a
monopropellant trim burn that completed the required impulse and improved the
impulse accuracy needed. The only change to the STAR48 was to add redundancy
to the safe and arm system.
4.7.7 Some Flight Motors
In this section the characteristics of some solid motor designs with successful
flight history are described.
4.7.7.1 Explorer I. Explorer I, the first U.S. spacecraft, was also the first
to carry a solid rocket motor. A small solid motor, integral with the spacecraft
structure, inserted the spacecraft into orbit. The motor, shown in Fig. 4.59, was
originally used as a scale model in the development of the Sergeant missile.
Table 4.21 summarizes the performance of the motor.
Research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the 1940s leads to the composites in
use today. The polysulfide-based propellant used on Explorer I is an early example
of composites. Explorer I was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in

In addition, the STAR48B™ has flown successfully on numerous Earth-orbiting
missions as a kick stage. The STAR48B™ was chosen to put Magellan in orbit
around Venus in 1990. It contains 4430 Ib of propellant and delivers 5.8 million

the Space Shuttle and the Titan family of launch vehicles. As shown in Fig. 4.61
and Table 4.23, the vehicle incorporates two solid rocket motors. Stage I contains
9710 kg of propellant, and stage II contains 2750 kg. Both stages have gimbaled
nozzles operated by hydraulic actuators. The upper stage has an extendible nozzle.
Both motors have carbon/carbon integral throats and two-dimensional carbon/
carbon exit cones and redundant ignition systems.
The grains have a tubular design that allows 50% offload capability. The mo-
tors are cast on a mandrel and then machined to nominal or offload requirements.
Offload machining follows the grain burning pattern. This approach does not al-
ter the thrust profile. The igniter can accommodate 50% offloading. Roll control
for both motors is provided by a monopropellant reaction control system on the
second stage. (The monopropellant system also provides three-axis control when
the motors are not firing.) Stage II can be flown with or without its extendible exit
cone (EEC). The increase in area ratio provides an additional 14.4 s in specific
impulse.30
4.8 Cold-Gas Systems
Cold-gas systems are the simplest and oldest type used for attitude control
thrusters. In the 1960s-era cold gas was the most common system type; the
system is still used in cases where the total impulse needed is less than about
lOOOlb-s.
4.8.1 Design Considerations
Figure 4.62 shows a typical cold-gas system. A typical system includes the
gas storage container, a gas loading valve, filtration, pressure regulation, pressure
relief, and a series of thrusters with valves.

Gas is loaded through a ground fitting, VI, and filter, Fl, (typically 20 /x) into
a titanium tank (see Section 4.6 for tank design information). Relatively high
pressures are used—34,500 kPa, for example. The gas might be isolated by an
ordnance valve V2 until release from the launch vehicle. Gas then flows through
filter F2, which protects the regulator and flows at a reduced pressure through the
low-pressure filter F3 to the thruster valves V3. On command, the thruster valves are
opened in pairs to produce attitude control torques. The small converging/diverging

system from regulator leakage or failure possibilities. The relief exhaust can be
split to provide zero torque on the vehicle.
The gases that have been used or tested are shown in Table 4.24. Helium,
nitrogen, and Freon 14 have flown. Helium has the best performance and lowest
gas weight; however, a leakage failure is less likely with nitrogen or freon. From
Table 4.24, note that the measured specific impulse is about 90% of theoretical,
less than you would expect of larger thrusters. This lower performance is primarily
caused by the conical nozzles commonly used, as opposed to the contoured nozzles
on larger thrusters.

V = ——— (4.68)
Design of the tankage is discussed in Section 4.4.4.
Example 4.12 Cold-Gas System Design
Design a cold-gas system to meet the following requirements: total impulse
is 4482 N-s, minimum impulse bit is 0.004 N-s, area ratio is 100, and thruster
temperature is maintained at 37.8°C.
Use helium as a working fluid.
Assuming a minimum valve response time of 20 ms, the thrust level can be
found as follows:
0.004F = ——— =0.2N0.02
A thrust level of 0.2 N is within the capability of cold-gas thrusters. If the spacecraft
is three-axis stabilized, 12 thrusters will be required to provide pure couples.
Note from Table 4.24 that a specific impulse of about 158s can be expected for
helium.
The helium weight required can be obtained from total impulse [Eq. (4.15)]:
The tank volume needed to contain 2.893 kg of helium plus 0.23 kg of unusable
helium is obtained from the equation of state; R for helium is 2078.5, temperature
31PK, tank pressure is 20684271 Pa (3000 psi).

stressed to 100,000 psi maximum for 6.6 Ib of helium at a maximum pressure of

the cold-gas system weighs 27 kg.

4.8.2.1 Viking Orbiter. The Viking Orbiter reaction control system pro-
vided three-axis control of the spacecraft when the main engine was not firing.
There were two redundant systems; one is shown in Fig. 4.63.
The systems used nitrogen gas as the propellant. Each tank held 7.03 kg of nitro-
gen at an initial supply pressure of 1.33 x 1011 Pa (4400 psig) and a temperature
of 37.8°C (100°F). The specific impulse was 68 s at 20°C (68°F). Nitrogen was
filtered enroute to six thrusters. The thrusters were mounted on the solar panel
tips to maximize moment arm and canted at 25 deg to avoid impingement on the
panels. The relief valve exhaust was branched to produce zero net torque.32
The system was designed to operate on helium borrowed from the main propul-
sion system in the event of failure. The system performance using nitrogen and
helium is summarized in Table 4.25 (Ref. 32).

The Viking Orbiter gives a rare opportunity to compare the performance of two
gases in the same thrusters. The minimum impulse bit was not measured with
helium; however, from Eq. (4.44) 7min is estimated to be 0.0027 N (0.00061 Ib-s)
for helium.
4.8.2.2 LANDS AT 3. The LANDS AT 3 was the third of a series of Earth
resource surveyor spacecraft. The 950-kg spacecraft provided complete multi-
spectral images of the Earth's surface every 18 days. The attitude control system
provided three-axis stabilization and nadir pointing for the spacecraft. Attitude
control torques were provided by six Freon-14 thrusters. The 7870-cc propellant
tank was initially charged with 5.5 kg of Freon-14 at 13789 kPa (2000 psia) at
20°C. Freon was fed to the thrusters through a pressure regulator. Each thruster
provided about 0.45-N thrust. The system provided a total impulse of 2523 N-s at
a measured specific impulse of 46.2 s (Ref. 12).

Problems
If you need propellant property data for these problems, it can be found in
Appendix B and elsewhere.
4.1 You are considering using N2O4/N2H4 bipropellant engines in your design.
One of the potential engine manufacturers claims that he has an engine which
will produce 2224 N thrust and a specific impulse of 327 s in a vacuum. Noticing
your skepticism, he provides you with the following test data from a near-vacuum
firing of the engine: a) pressure in the test chamber during firing = 2.482 kPa,
b) measured thrust = 2157 N, c) measured propellant flow rate = 0.7049 kg/s,
d) measured chamber pressure = 1965 kPa, and e) measured gas total tem-
perature = 3283°K. The engine has a throat area of 6.5374 sq cm and an area
ratio of 65. From other sources you know that the exhaust gas produced by this
propellant combination has a molecular weight of 18.9 and the ratio of specific

Attitude Control
E. M. Dukes
Attitude control deals with the orientation of the spacecraft axes with respect
to an inertial reference frame. An instantaneous spacecraft attitude is commonly
described by a pitch angle, a roll angle, and a yaw angle. The most frequently
used inertial reference frame is shown in Fig. 5.1. The +X vector is parallel to the
spacecraft velocity vector. The +X and +Z axes are contained in the orbit plane, as
is the velocity vector. The +Z is "up," opposed to the gravity vector. The +Y vector
is perpendicular to the orbit plane. Spacecraft attitude is measured as an angular
deviation of the spacecraft body axes from these inertial coordinates. The attitude
control system (ACS), controls the spacecraft body axes such that the errors in
pitch, yaw, and roll angles are within defined limits. Note the distinction between
attitude control, which deals with rotation about spacecraft axes, and guidance and
control, which deals with an objects position in geographical coordinates, usually
latitude and longitude.
Any uncontrolled body in space, for example, an asteroid, will tumble about
all axes in response to natural forces, notably solar pressure, gravity gradients,
and magnetic torques. Sputnik I, the first spacecraft, was allowed to tumble in
this way. However, natural tumbling is not normally acceptable for a spacecraft
because solar panels must be pointed at the sun for power, antennas must be pointed
at an Earth station for communication, and science instruments must be pointed at
their targets. As a result, spacecraft attitude must be controlled. From this simple
requirement comes arguably the most technically sophisticated subsystem in the
spacecraft.
As Malcom Shuster1 so beautifully put it, "The baggage of attitude studies
is very extensive and not particularly easy to acquire." In this section we will
describe what this mathematical baggage does in general and leave more in-depth
understanding to the discretion of the reader.
Explorer I, the first U.S. spacecraft, had the simplest form of attitude control; it
was spun about one axis. A spinning spacecraft tends to hold one axis, the spin axis,
fixed in inertial coordinates. Having one axis fixed is adequate for many missions.
For example, if the spin axis is perpendicular to the sun vector the body can be
populated with solar cells to provide power needs (see Fig. 5.2). Omnidirectional
antennas can be used, and some pay loads need no more than one fixed axis. This
attitude control method is still in use today; however, it is not as simple as it sounds.
In today's complex missions, many spacecraft have requirements too diverse for
the one-axis control. It is not unusual for a spacecraft to need solar panels pointed to
the sun, science payload (a camera for example) pointed at the planet surface, and
a high-gain antenna pointed at a ground station. For complex situations three-axis
control is required (see Fig. 5.3).

ATTITUDE CONTROL 257
Fig. 5.4 Attitude control operation.
The attitude control task can be divided into three subtasks: 1) measuring atti-
tude, which is done by attitude sensors such as gyroscopes; 2) correcting attitude,
which is done by torquers or actuators such as thrusters; and 3) a control law, which
is software that determines the magnitude and direction of torque in response to
a given disturbance. The ACS, conceptually simple, is a classic feedback control
system as shown in Fig. 5.4. If the spacecraft drifts off the desired attitude, the
sensors detect the error, the control law determines the magnitude of the response
and directs a torquer to correct it.
In Section 5.1 the requirements definition for an attitude control system is de-
scribed. The most important of these is the selection of the basic system type.
This choice has significant impact on all of the subsystems. The disturbances
that make attitude control necessary are torques from solar pressure, aerodynam-
ics, magnetic fields, gravity gradients, and spacecraft activities (rotating antennas,
pointing cameras, etc.). These disturbances are discussed in Section 5.2. The first
step in control is the determination of current attitude as discussed in Section 5.3.
The actual control process is discussed in Section 5.4. The attitude control system
also controls spacecraft maneuvers to new attitudes; these maneuvers are discussed
in Section 5.5, and attitude control hardware is discussed in Section 5.6.
5.1 Requirements Definition
The steps in setting ACS requirements are as follows:
1) Summarize mission pointing direction requirements. This is usually defined
by the payload as well as the mission design [usually nadir (or Earth) pointing,
inertial target, or scanning].
2) Summarize mission and payload pointing accuracy requirements. Pointing
accuracy is a function of both knowledge accuracy and control accuracy. Knowl-
edge accuracy is a function of the inherent accuracy of the sensors used and the
attitude determination method used. Control accuracy is a function of the capabil-
ity of the actuators and the accuracy of the control law. Typical pointing accuracy
requirements: a) solar array: 4 to 10 deg; b) high-gain antenna: 0.1 to 0.5 deg;
c) optics, telescopes, and cameras: 0.001 to 0.1 deg.
3) Define the translational and rotational maneuvering required for the mission
including angles, durations, rates, and frequency. (The propulsion requirements
come from this activity.)

4) Select the ACS type. The selection of system type is a major driver for the
entire spacecraft design. Type selection requires knowledge of a) payload pointing
requirements (usually the major driver); b) thrust vector control requirements;
c) control authority and allowable attitude error, for translational A V maneuvers;
d) maneuver slew rates, a driver if greater than about 0.5 deg/s; e) approximate
solar panel area. (If panel area is large compared to the spacecraft body area,
three-axis stabilization is indicated.)
5) Quantify the internal and external disturbance torques.
6) Select and size the major hardware elements.
7) Define the control law and attitude determination method.
8) Conduct trade studies to improve the requirements and selections.
Figure 5.5 shows the repetitive cycle of these tasks as the system design is refined
and improved.

ATTITUDE CONTROL 259
The most common attitude control systems types are as follows: 1) spin sta-
bilized, 2) dual spin, 3) three-axis stabilized, 4) momentum bias, and 5) gravity
gradient. A spin-stabilized spacecraft is one in which the entire spacecraft spins
around the axis with the highest moment of inertia. A dual-spin spacecraft has a
spinning segment and an inertially fixed section. A three-axis controlled spacecraft
is one which actively controls the inertial position of all three axes. Gravity-gradient
control is completely passive and takes advantage of the spacecraft tendency to
align the long axis with the gravity gradient. A momentum bias system uses a
momentum wheel to provide stiffness in two axes and wheel speed to control the
third axis. Several other types have been successfully used but are uncommon.
Sometimes different methods are used on the same spacecraft for different mis-
sion phases which have different control requirements.
Table 5.1 compares typical hardware implementation of each system type.
Table 5.2 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the types of stabi-
lization. Table 5.3 compares the suitability of the primary attitude control system
types to various missions. It is assumed in Table 5.3 that the three-axis control
system has both thrusting capability and reaction wheels.
5.1.1 Spin-Stabilized System
A spin-stabilized spacecraft (Fig. 5.2) takes advantage of the inherent resis-
tance of a spinning body to disturbance torques. If no disturbance torques are
experienced, the momentum vector remains constant in magnitude and fixed in
inertial space. If a disturbance torque occurs that is parallel to the momentum vec-
tor, the spin rate will be affected but not the attitude. Thrusters are used to correct
the spin rate. Disturbance torques perpendicular to the momentum vector will
cause the spin axis to precess; thruster force can be used to remove precession.
Rotational maneuvers are performed by precessing the spin axis. Translational
maneuvers are always made parallel to the spin axis. Maneuvering is a slow and
energy-consuming process because of the inherent stability of the vehicle.
5.1.1.1 Advantages. Spin stabilization is useful in situations that require
simplicity, low cost, modest pointing accuracy, and minimal maneuvering. Stabi-
lization about transverse axes is passive for long periods of time.
Sensor gyros, momentum exchange devices, and onboard computers are unnec-
essary on a spinner. Substantial cost and mass savings result.
Spin stabilization greatly simplifies the use of solid rocket motors for transla-
tional maneuvers by eliminating the need for thrust vector control. INTELSAT VI,
for example, is three-axis-stabilized during its mission; however, it was spun during
solid motor A V burns to control the thrust vector.
The centrifugal force generated by spinning provides a bottoming force on
propellants and makes 0-g propellant control devices unnecessary.
Spinning also supplies a scanning motion very desirable for some instruments.
5.1.1.2 Disadvantages. Pointing accuracy is low, 0.3 to 1 deg. Tight con-
trol of the moments of inertia is required. The moment of inertia about the spin
axis must be substantially greater than that about the transverse axis or the vehicle
will reverse axes. The moment of inertia ratio must be well above 1; a ratio of 1.2

is a common requirement. The inertia ratio requires constant monitoring in the
same manner as mass and power margins.
Virtually the only location for solar arrays is the spinning body exterior. Total
power available is limited to that which can be obtained from the body surface. In
addition, this area is not in the sun all of the time. A given area on a cylindrical
spinning body gets only 32% of the solar intensity that would fall on a pointed
planar array. Power is therefore a scarce commodity on a spinner.
The maneuver rate is limited. A maneuver is made by precessing the spin axis,
which is a relatively slow process. Maneuver slew rates greater than 0.5 deg/s
indicate three-axis stabilization.
Body pointing of pay load sensors and antenna is not possible.
Examples of spinning spacecraft are Explorer I, Pioneer Venus, and INTELSAT
I, II, and III.
5.1.2 Dual-Spin System
Dual spinning is a compromise design, which has some of the simplicity of a
spinner and some of the pointing accuracy of a three-axis vehicle. As shown in

while an instrument platform is despun to point at instruments or an antenna.
5.1.2.1 Advantages. The vehicle is stable about the transverse axes for
long periods of time. Sensing gyros and onboard computers are not required.
The spinning body provides a built-in scan for sensors and provides a centrifugal
bottoming force for any liquid propellants. Thrust vector control is not required
for AV maneuvers.
The despun platform provides pointing for antenna and instruments.
5.1.2.2 Disadvantages. The despin drive assembly (motor, bearings, slip
rings) is expensive and failure prone.
Nadir tracking is not practical except at very high altitudes, geosynchronous and
above. Solar-array efficiency is limited because a given cell is illuminated 32% of
the time.

Complex nutation dynamics must be dealt with. For stability a dual spinner
places constraints on the inertial properties and damping in the spun and despun
sections. The energy dissipation of the spun section must be greater than that of the
despun section. This turned out to be an expensive issue late in the development
of Galileo.
Examples of dual-spin spacecraft are Galileo and INTELSAT VI.
5.1.3 Three-Axis-Stabilized System
A three-axis-stabilized system (Fig. 5.7) actively maintains the vehicle axis sys-
tem aligned with a reference system, usually inertial reference or nadir reference.
A typical system uses gyros as inertial reference and updates the gyros periodically
using star scanning or horizon scanning. Attitude errors are removed by torquing
reaction wheels, which are periodically unloaded using thrusters. The thruster lay-
out provides pure torque about all three axes and positive or negative translation
along each axis. An attitude control computer houses the software, which controls
the process.
5.1.3.1 Advantages. The system provides unlimited pointing capability in
any direction—nadir, inertial, sun, scanning—and provides the best pointing accu-
racy, limited only by sensor accuracy. Pointing accuracy of greater than 0.001 deg
can be achieved.
Solar panels can make full use of the available solar energy. Solar panel size is
not restricted. This type is the most adaptable to changing requirements.
5.1.3.2 Disadvantages. ACS hardware (gyros, reaction wheels, star scan-
ners, computers) are complex, heavy, high-power consumers, failure sources, and
expensive. Active thrust vector control is required for A V burns. Propellant tanks
require 0-g propellant control devices.
Redundancy schemes are more complex; for example, what watches for
computer error, another computer? Two out of three? Mechanical gimbals are

required for scanning instruments. Examples of three-axis-controlled spacecraft
are Magellan, INTELSAT VIII, the Hubble Telescope, and GPS.
5.1.4 Gravity-Gradient System
Gravity-gradient stabilization takes advantage of the tendency of a spacecraft
to align its long axis with the gravity vector; gravity force F\ is greater than F2
in Fig. 5.8. For this stabilizing technique to work, it is necessary that the gravity-
gradient torques are greater than any disturbance torque; this criteria can usually be
met in orbits lower than 1000 km. It is necessary for the moment of inertia about x
and y axis to be much greater than the moment of inertia about the z axis. Deployed
booms have been used on the long axis to improve the inertial properties. Gravity
gradient stabilizes the pitch and roll axes only and not the yaw axis. It is common
practice to use a momentum wheel with its axis perpendicular to the orbit plane
to provide stiffness in yaw. Gravity-gradient control torques are small at best, and
active damping might be required to prevent slow oscillations of as much as 10 deg.
Gravity-gradient stabilization is useful when long life and high reliability are
required and the pointing requirements are modest. Spacecraft that have used
gravity-gradient stabilization include ATS-5, GEOSAT, and ORBCOM.
5.1.5 Momentum Bias System
A momentum-bias system (Fig. 5.9) uses a momentum wheel to provide inertial
stiffness in two axes and control of wheel speed provides control in the third axis.

ATTITUDE CONTROL 265
This system is particularly useful for a nadir pointing spacecraft using wheel speed
to hold z axis on nadir.
The system is relatively simple and good for long-life missions. It is cheaper
than a three-axis system. It offers good pointing in one axis (usually pitch) and poor
accuracy in the wheel axes (usually roll/yaw). Momentum bias cannot achieve the
pointing accuracy of three-axis control. Maneuvering capability is very restricted,
and supplementary schemes are required for orbit insertion. INTELSAT VIII, for
example, used spin stabilization for launch and orbit insertion. It does not pro-
vide adequate torque authority for thrust vector control. Seasat and more recently
INTELSAT VIII used this technique.
5.2 Disturbance Torques
If a spacecraft were released into Earth orbit without attitude control, it would
tumble in response to five different kinds of environmental torques: 1) drag
torque—orbits below about 500 km; 2) gravity-gradient torque—orbits 500 to
35,000 km; 3) magnetic torque—orbits 500 to 35,000 km; 4) solar torque—
dominant geosynchronous and above; and 5) spacecraft-generated torques.
Torque is generated by asymmetry of the spacecraft relative to the disturbance.
For example, a spherical-shaped body would experience drag that is important
for orbit determination, but there would be no drag torque resulting in an attitude
disturbance. The physical properties of the surfaces, which will be discussed in
more detail below, in combination with their symmetry relative to the disturbance,
determine the impact of the various disturbance torques.
5.2.1 Solar Torque
When a solar photon strikes a spacecraft surface, there is a small momentum
exchange, and a force is exerted on the surface as shown in Fig. 5.10. The pressure
produced is proportional to the projection of the surface area perpendicular to the
sun and the solar intensity, which is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance from the sun. The pressure produced also depends on whether the photon
was absorbed, specularly reflected (as a mirror), or diffusely reflected.
5.2.1.1 Absorption. If the solar radiation impinging on a surface is totally
absorbed (Fig. 5.10a), the force on the surface will be aligned with the sun vector
and of magnitude

magnitude given by Eq. (5.1). The net force vector resulting from the reflected
component is normal to the surface; all tangential components cancel. The mag-
nitude of the diffuse component is two-thirds that of the absorption component
[two-thirds of Eq. (5.1)].3
Note that the extent to which solar energy is absorbed, diffusely reflected, or
specularly reflected is a surface property of the material upon which the sunlight
falls.
5.2.1.4 So/ar torque. The solar torque on the spacecraft is the sum of
all of the forces on all elemental surfaces times the radius from the centroid of
the surface to the spacecraft center of mass. The reflectivity is represented by q,
where q = 1 is a specular reflector and q = 0 is an absorber. The reflectivity q of
the various spacecraft elements is a known (measured) property of the materials.
The relative sun angle is accounted for in the area calculation, where A is the
projected area normal to the sun vector. The following equation represents the
total solar torque on the body caused by a spacecraft surface:
(5.3)
where
Ts = solar torque on the spacecraft caused by a surface A, N-m
A = area of surface projected to sun line normal, m2
L — distance from the centroid of the surface to the center of mass
of the spacecraft, m
q = reflectance factor between 0 and 1, unitless. Spacecraft bodies tend to be
reflectors; a q of 0.5 is representative4; solar panels tend to be absorbers,
a q of 0.3 is representative
Solar torques increase in relative importance with orbital altitude. Above
1000-km solar pressure is usually the dominant external torque on the vehicle.
In geosynchronous orbit solar torque is the disturbance, which sizes the station-
keeping propellant load and hence the orbital life of the spacecraft. Solar pressure is
also important to the design of planetary vehicles, especially for the inner planets.
Solar pressure was used, on an emergency basis, to control roll on Mariner Venus-
Mercury (Mariner 10)3. In the 1970s solar sailing was seriously considered as
a source of continuous, low-level thrust for interplanetary travel. Feasibility was
established; however, the practical problems of deploying and controlling large
sails are considerable.
Example 5.1 Solar Pressure
Part I: What is the solar force on a 9 m2 solar panel inclined at 20 deg to the sun
with a reflectance factor q of 0.3 if the vehicle is in Earth orbit? From Eq. (5.3),

Fs = 4.0 x 10~5 N

panel of this size with a 1-m body with the e.g. in the center of the body and a

0.25-m boom to attach the panel?
T = (4.0 x I(r5)(2.25)
T = 9.0 x 1(T5 N-m
To calculate to the total solar torque acting on the spacecraft, the sum of the solar
torques acting on each surface must be taken into account with strict attention
to the direction (sign) of the individual torques. Also, this calculation would be
performed in three dimensions unlike the simple example.
5.2.2 Magnetic Torques
The Earth and several other planets have a magnetic field that produces torque
on spacecraft. The torque of any magnetic field on a current-carrying coil is
T=NIABsinO (5.4)
where
T = magnetic torque, N-m
N — number of loops in the coil
/ = current in the coil, amp
A = coil area, m2
B = Earth's magnetic field, tesla (still encountered is the cgs unit for #, which
is gauss, 1 G is 10~4 tesla)
9 = angle between the magnetic field lines and perpendicular to the coil
The residual magnetic field of a spacecraft is the result of current loops and
residual magnetism in the metal parts. It can be expressed as the product
M = NIA (5.5)
and
T=MBsin0 (5.6)
An accurate value of the residual dipole of a spacecraft must be obtained by test.
The value can be as little as 0.2 A-m2 or as much as 20 A-m2 depending on
spacecraft size, with 2 A-m2 a representative value.4 Onboard compensation can
be used to reduce the residual dipole if necessary.
The Earth's magnetic field is tilted 11 deg with respect to the Earth's rotational
axis and is centered about 400 km from the Earth's geometric center; hence, at a
given altitude the field is stronger over the Pacific than the Atlantic.1 The magnetic
field strength varies as one over radius from the Earth's center cubed; thus, the
higher the orbit the less disturbance. The field strength also varies by a factor of
2 depending on latitude; with the highest value at the poles, from Piscane and

Z Nadir
Fig. 5.11 Gravity-gradient torque.
5.2.3 Gravity-Gradient Torque
Gravity-gradient torques arise from the fact that the lower extremities of the
spacecraft are subjected to exponentially higher gravity forces than the upper
extremities. The effect is particularly pronounced for long slender spacecraft; the
effect acts to align the long axis with the Earth radius vector. Figure 5.11 shows
a dumbbell-shaped spacecraft with the mass equally divided into two spheres.
The net forces on the spacecraft are in equilibrium at the center of gravity. The
gravitational acceleration on the lower mass is
GM(5.8)
and on the upper mass
g =GM(5.9)
Because r2 is greater than r\9 the gravitational force is greater on the lower mass
than the upper mass, and the net force tends to hold the spacecraft upright. It is
convenient to assign a gravitational constant /x, which is the product of central
body mass M and gravitational constant G. The resulting torque is (assuming that
small angles, in radian measure, are equal to their sine)

Note that gravity gradient produces torques in two axes. Note also that it requires
an angular error to produce a torque. This characteristic is the basis for gravity-
gradient control. In this case it is desired to maintain the z axis to nadir. Disturbances
cause a displacement of the z axis, which in turn results in a restoring gravity torque.

5.2.4 Aerodynamic Drag
Aerodynamic drag is a source of torque as well as velocity reduction for space-
craft in low Earth orbits. Drag force can be estimated from the classic relationship
(5.11)
where
D = drag force (always aligned with the velocity vector and opposite in sign)
p — atmospheric density, kg/m3
Purchased from American Institute  of Aeronautics and Astronautics  
 

<<<PAGE 284>>>

272 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
V = spacecraft velocity, m/s
Cd = drag coefficient depends on shape but usually about 2.5
A = area normal to velocity vector, m2
Drag force is the ultimate cause of orbit decay and reentry of low-Earth-orbit
spacecraft. Although the atmospheric density is very low, the spacecraft velocity
is very high; over time inactive spacecraft below about 1000 km will reenter. The
greatest uncertainty in a spacecraft drag analysis is in the atmospheric density.
In addition to the variation with altitude, at high altitudes the density varies with
temperature and therefore, time of day. It also varies with the intensity of solar
radiation activity, which has an approximate 11-year cycle. High density is associ-
ated with high solar activity. It also varies with the season, with the latitude, with
the rotation of the atmosphere, and with atmospheric tides.
For attitude control, it is important how the drag acts on various surfaces,
much like the solar pressure torques. The torque results from a moment arm
between the center-of-pressure and the e.g. If the spacecraft is symmetric, i.e.,
the center-of-pressure is coincident with the e.g., then no aerodynamic torque
is produced. However, it is rarely the case that the center-of-pressure and the
center of gravity are coincident for all three axes. The drag torque is calculated
as
T = DL (5.12)
where L is the distance between the center of pressure and the e.g.
Example 5.4 Drag Force
Part I: Consider a spacecraft in a 400-km circular Earth orbit. What is the drag
force on a solar panel with 9 m2 of surface area normal to the velocity vector?
The velocity of a spacecraft in a 400-km altitude Earth orbit is 7.669 km/s (see
Chapter 3 on orbital mechanics). Assuming the atmospheric density at 400 km is
1.2 x 10~n kg/m3, under average conditions, and the drag force is
D = 1/2(1.2 x 10-n)(7669)2(2.5)(9) = 7.9 x 10~3 N
Part II: Using the same spacecraft as in the solar torque example, assume that
the body and solar arrays are each uniform such that their center of pressures are
at the centroid. The torque on the main body would be zero because the e.g. is at
the centroid. The drag torque caused by the solar array is
T = (7.9 x 10~3)(2.25m) = 1.78 x 10"2N-m
The area of high-altitude drag is one in which large margins should be used
as result of the large uncertainty of atmospheric density and uncertainty in drag
coefficient. It is also important that the spacecraft is symmetric with the center
of pressure close to the e.g. Otherwise, major resources such as propellant or
power for large reaction wheels will be consumed in counteracting large drag
torques.

ATTITUDE CONTROL 273
5.2.5 Spacecraft-Generated Torques
In addition to the environmental torques, there are a variety of spacecraft-
generated torques of concern to the operation of the attitude control system. These
torques are generally much smaller than the external torques but need to be ac-
counted for especially for a high-precision pointing system. The common causes
of internal torques are as follows: 1) pointing rotation of solar arrays, antennas,
or cameras; 2) deployment of antennas, solar arrays, instruments, booms; 3) parts
jettison, which means that the spacecraft will react to jettison of parts such as
covers, doors, and solid-rocket-motor cases; 4) propellant slosh, which can cause
motion of the vehicle and e.g. (slosh is greatly attenuated by bladders and di-
aphragms); 5) flexible appendages can cause motion by thermal distortion or by
dynamic interaction with the attitude control system; 6) reaction wheel imbalance,
which is caused by small misalignments in the reaction wheels.
5.2.6 System Sizing
Once all of the disturbance torques have been identified and quantified, the
actuator sizing can be determined. The first consideration is the magnitude of
the torques. The actuator must have sufficient torque authority to conteract the
disturbance torques. The difference in the magnitude of the disturbance torque
and the actuator torque capability is a measure of the control authority. Typically,
the control authority is expressed as a percentage such that an actuator with twice
the capability of the disturbance torques would have a 100% control authority
margin.
After the actuator with sufficient control authority is chosen, then the system
resources over time must be considered. In the case of a three-axis-stabilized
spacecraft with reaction wheels, the storage time of the reaction wheels must be
considered. Reaction wheels store momentum until they reach their maximum
specified speed, at which point they are saturated and must be desaturated by
another torque. In low Earth orbit, magnetic torquers are typically used for wheel
desaturation. For higher orbits or interplanetary spacecraft the reaction control
system or thrusters are used. Considerations for the frequency of desaturation are
the disturbances caused by the event and, in the case of thruster desaturation,
the amount of propellant consumed. Magnetic torquers require electrical power
but avoid the use of consumable propellant. If thruster control is selected, the
disturbances caused by the thruster firings and the amount of propellant consumed
must be considered.
Example 5.5 Reaction Wheel Sizing
Consider the spacecraft from the solar torque and drag force examples and
determine the size, that is, the torque capability and momentum storage capability
of a reaction wheel required to maintain position and require desaturation once per
98-min orbit.
In this case the solar torque and the drag torque are acting in the same direction,
so
T = Solar torque + Drag torque = 9.0 x 10"5 +1.78 x 10~2 = 1.789 x 10~2 N-m

<<<PAGE 286>>>

274 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
So the reaction wheel torque capability, ignoring maneuvers, is >1.85 x 10~2
N-m.
The momentum buildup over one orbit is given by
M = T x t = 1.85 x 1(T2*(98*60) = 108.6 N-m-s
As will be discussed later in Section 5.6.2, it would require fairly large and
heavy reaction wheels to accommodate this momentum buildup. A better alter-
native might be to have two, smaller solar panels placed symmetrically about the
central body. However, there may be reasons, such as instrument field of view, that
necessitate the single panel and require the relatively large reaction wheels.
5.3 Attitude Determination
Attitude determination is the process of estimating the orientation of the space-
craft with respect to a reference frame, on a more or less continuous basis, and
location of the sun, Earth, and other objects in the same frame. The process is
conceptually simple, as shown in Fig. 5.12, but is mathematically complex to the
point of obscurity. Only the most important parts of that baggage will be discussed
in this section.
Attitude is determined by the following:
1) Gathering data from the onboard sensors. These data are corrected for errors
and biases, then analyzed by mathematically sophisticated methods to determine
the attitude estimate. (The mechanization of common sensors is discussed in
Section 5.6.)
2) Body frame axes or spin axis location is determined from the sensor data.
3) The instantaneous attitude, or state vector, is expressed with respect to a
reference frame, usually inertial or geocentric, as a set of Euler angles, a direction
cosine matrix, or a quaternion.
4) The attitude estimate is the basis for correcting the attitude (see Section 5.4).
5.3.1 Attitude Determination Methods
The spacecraft axes must be located with respect to a reference frame (and vice
versa) because the target of the spacecraft payload and/or sensors are specified
relative to a reference frame. The payload can be pointed to specific points on
the Earth's surface or at a specific celestial object. These targets are typically
specified in an inertial reference frame so the relationship of the spacecraft body,

and subsequently the sensor body, is an important relationship. Length dimensions
from the origin are not important to attitude determination or control; only angular
relationships are important. Consequently, unit vectors are used for computation.
The conventional spacecraft frame of reference points the spacecraft +Z axis
anti-nadir, and the +X axis in the direction of motion is shown in Fig. 5.13 along
with the angle convention for pitch, yaw, and roll.
The relationship between the reference frame and the spacecraft frame are de-
fined by three rotation angles known as Euler angles. Euler angles are a set of
three angles and a sequence of rotation such that one coordinate system can be
rotated into another. Both the magnitude of the angles and the sequence of rotation
are important; if another sequence is used, the result will be different. It can be
shown that there are 12 different Euler sets that describe the same relative position.
Figure 5.14 shows an Euler angle rotation sequence.
A direction cosine matrix (DCM) can be defined as the product of the three Euler
rotations. Consider the rotation of a spacecraft frame into an inertial reference
frame; make the rotations in the sequence yaw, pitch, roll.
Define /?i, #2, and R^ as the three rotation matrices that correspond to the three
Euler angles ^,0, and 0. Then the total rotation ^, 0, and 0 can be expressed as

If the angles are infinitesimal, it can be shown that matrix multiplication is com-
mutative, and the rotations can be made in any order.
Performing a rotation using a direction cosine matrix [Eq. (5.17)] requires 27
multiples, 15 adds, and, if the small-angle simplification cannot be used (as in
Eq. (5.22)], 29 trigonometric evaluations. Therefore, direction cosine matrices
require a large amount of memory and are computationally intensive.
5.3.1.1 Quaternions. One widely used alternative to the direction cosine
matrix is the quaternion, sometimes referred to as Euler symmetric parameters,
which has no singularities and no trigonometric functions. Quaternions make use
of Euler's theorem, which states that any series of rotations of a rigid body can
be expressed as a single rotation about a fixed axis. The orientation of a body
can be defined by a vector giving the direction of a body axis and a scalar angle
specifying a rotation angle about that axis. Thus, quaternions express the same
information as a direction cosine matrix, that is, a rotation from one frame to
another, with four elements. Three elements describe the vector of rotation, and
the fourth element is the angle of rotation. Quaternion mathematics was actually
formulated by Hamilton7 in 1843 but was not applied to coordinate rotations
until Whittaker's work8 first published in the 1937. A rigorous derivation of Euler
symmetric parameters may be found in Wertz.9
Let the four elements of a quaternion be q\, #2, #3, <?4- Then, the quaternion
gis
Q = iq\ + jqi + kqi + #4 (5.23)
where /, y, and k satisfy the following conditions:
i2 = f = k2 = -l (5.24)
ij = -ji = k (5.25)
jk = -kj = i (5.26)
ki = -ik = j (5.27)
The quaternion is often written in the general form
Q = (41,42,43,44) (5.28)
If a set of four Euler symmetric parameters corresponding to a rigid-body rotation
are the components of Q, then Q is the representation of the rigid-body rotation.
Two quaternions, Q and P, are equal if and only if all of the elements are equal,
that is,
q\=p\, 32 = P2, qi = PS, q4 = p4 (5.29)
Quaternion multiplication is not commutative, and so like DCMs the order of
operation must be taken into account:
R = QP = (iqi + jq2 + kq3 + 44)0>i + JP2 + kp3 + /?4) (5.30)

R = (-q\p\ - q2p2 ~ qiPi + q^pti + i(q\p* + q2p3
k(q\p2 -q2p\
(5.31)
The conjugate of Q is given by
G* = -iqi - jq2 - kq3 + q4 (5.32)
The inverse of Q is another quaternion P, which satisfies
QP = 1 (5.33)
or
QQ-1 = 1 (5.34)
The norm (or magnitude) of a quaternion is a scalar quantity defined as
N = \Q\ = GG* = q\ + q\ + ql + q24 (5.35)
A quaternion with N = 1 is said to be "normalized," and the inverse is equal to the
conjugate:
22* = 1 = QQ-1 (5.36)
and
G* - G"1 (5.37)
This property is very useful in practice; thus, attitude determination is usually done
with normalized quaternions.

the choice throughout this text.

C =(2q\q2 - 2q4q3) (2q\q3 + 2q4q2)
(2q{q2
- 2q4q2) 2q\ -(5.50)

The preceding equations can be used to solve for the quaternion elements. The

convenience, the positive square root. Then use Eqs. (5.54-5.56) to establish the
signs of the remaining elements.

The computation of Qac requires 15 multiplies and 12 adds. It does not require
any trigonometric evaluations. Thus, the use of quaternions offers a significant
advantage in both computer memory and computing time.
The common methods of representing three-axis attitude are compared in
Table 5.6.
5.3.2 Axis Location from Sensor Output
The most basic methods of axis location are deterministic in that they use the
same number of observations as variables. Deterministic methods are most useful
when the orientation of only one axis needs to be specified. A single axis requires
two parameters. Generally, for a spin-stabilized spacecraft, specifying the orien-
tation of the spin axis with respect to some inertial coordinate frame is sufficient
along with knowledge of the spin rate.
5.3.2.1 Spin-axis method. A deterministic, two-component attitude solu-
tion for a spin-stabilized spacecraft requires two measurements: 1) the sun angle
relative to the spin axis and 2) the Earth radius vector angle relative to the spin
axis. The intersection of these two cones is the spin axis, as shown in Fig. 5.15.
There are two solutions for the intersection: the real and the imaginary spin
vector. The ambiguity can be resolved by taking the measurements again at a later
time. The true solution will remain unchanged, whereas the imaginary solution
changes.
Assume that the inertial frame of interest is the celestial system of right ascension
a and declination 5, as shown in Fig. 5.16.

The sun vector and the Earth vector in inertial coordinates are parameters
onboard from ephemeris tables or polynomials. The position of celestial bodies is
determined using ephemeris that is calculated on the ground based on the reduc-
tion of tracking data, which is typically in either table form or polynomial form.
Ephemeris tables are usually updated regularly from the ground; they require large
amounts of onboard computer memory and are highly accurate if the table is large
enough. Polynomials require less memory and more computation time; they also
require coefficient updates from the ground. High accuracy can be obtained by us-
ing high (^eighth-order) polynomials. For example, Magellan used eighth-order

LaGrange polynomials for the sun and Earth positions. Polynomial coefficients
were updated about every 50 days to maintain knowledge within 0.1 deg.
The right ascension and declination of the spin vector can then be obtained by
solving the following equations:
cos </> = sin 8M sin 8S + cos 8M cos 8S cos(aw - as) (5.60)
cos 0 = sin 8M sin SE + cos 8^ cos SE cos(aM — OLE) (5.61)
where
as = sun right ascension
8S = sun declination
OLE — Earth right ascension
SE = Earth declination
ofM = spin-axis right ascension
8M = spin-axis declination
The spin axis is completely described by its right ascension and declination; how-
ever, sometimes knowledge of the pointing direction of a fixed body axis is also
required. The azimuth angle measures the body rotation about the spin axis and is
effectively measured each time the sun or Earth sensors trigger.
The accuracy of the solution obtained depends on many factors such as mea-
surement uncertainties, biases, systematic errors, and sensor misalignments. One
way to decrease the uncertainties is to calculate the attitude using several different
methods and using a weighted average of the results. For a spin-stabilized space-
craft with one sun sensor and two Earth sensors mounted at different angles, there
are six methods of determining attitude.
A method similar to that used for the spin-stabilized spacecraft can be used
when there is a particular body axis about which there is preferential attitude data
such as the spin axis of a momentum wheel. The spinner method can also be used
for attitude acquisition, when a particular body axis is fixed inertially; however,
the accuracy is usually insufficient for the more precise pointing normally required
for a three-axis-stabilized vehicle.
5.3.2.2 Two-vector method. Three-axis-attitude determination is more
complex because it requires the complete specification of the attitude matrix
(DCM). Attitude can be determined by solving for the rotation matrix R by using
two vectors measured in the body frame. Any two vectors define an orthogonal
coordinate system, provided that the vectors are not parallel. Let u and v define
the following coordinate system (after the method of Markley, Ref. 9, p. 424):
x = u (5.62)
y = f^r (5-63)\U X V|
z = x x y (5.64)
Let Ub and v& be two vectors measured in the spacecraft body frame such that a
sun vector is measured by a two-axis sun sensor and a star vector measured by a
star tracker. Assume the X body axis is aligned to the sun vector and the Y body

axis is perpendicular to the sun-star plane, then the spacecraft body matrix can be
determined as
Xb = Ub
Ub X Vb
\ub x vb\
= *b *yb
Mb-pi
LZbl
Mb is the direction cosine matrix for the measured estimate of the pointing of
the body in the sun-star reference frame. For this application the J2000 reference
frame is the most commonly used. J2000 is an Earth-mean-equator of epoch
2000 reference frame. This estimate of attitude does not take into account the
relative accuracy of the two measured vectors except that u was used as a basis,
implying that u is the more accurate measurement. However, error sources, such
as measurement error, biases, and misalignments, have not been accounted for.
The next step is to determine how well the spacecraft is pointed relative to the
desired position. A reference, or desired matrix, can also be determined by using
a sun vector from ephemeris and a star vector from a star catalog to yield
xr =ur
Ur X Vryr =\ur x vr

Then, the attitude error between the measured pointing Mb and the desired pointing
Mr is given by

5.3.3 Quaternion Parameterization of the Attitude Error
Quaternions simplify the computational work done by the spacecraft computer
in implementing a control law as described in this section. (That is not to say that
they make the computation easier to understand.) The position error is computed
from sensor output as follows:
'-e\ sin(A0/2)~
-^sin(A0/2) (5'67)
cos(A6>/2)

where
Q'b = current, measured body attitude expressed as a quaternion
Qld = desired body attitude expressed as a quaternion
Qdb = difference between current and desired attitude expressed as a
quaternion
£1,2,3 = error
In this case both the current and the desired quaternions define a rotation from
the spacecraft body to inertial space but for different spacecraft orientations. The
delta quaternion (difference between current and desired) expresses the spacecraft
rotation required to achieve the desired attitude. In effect the inertial components
cancel, and what remains is the current body to desired body rotation. The magni-
tude of the rotation required is then
0 = 2cos~1#4 (5.68)
The errors in the current body frame are then extracted by taking the projection
of the Euler axis in the body frame as follows:
By using the small-angle approximation, sin# ^ 9, small errors, £(y), can be
expressed as
£(j) = -2Qdb(j), 7 = 1,2,3 (5.70)
The rate error can be determined using quaternions as follows:
Q"p = G'p(6i)"' (5-71)
where
Qlp = already measured body attitude
Qbp = delta quaternion between preceding and current attitude
Ar = control cycle period or time between attitude measurements
For small rotations, again using the small-angle approximation,
= 7-1.2.3 0.TO
5.3.4 State Estimation Methods
State estimation methods successively correct estimates of the attitude by using
the partial derivatives of the observables with respect to the solved-for attitude
parameters. The collection of attitude parameters are called the state vector. The
state vector can represent many attitude parameters such as rates, biases, temper-
ature dependencies, and orbit profile effects. Parameters can be weighted based
on their known accuracy and a judgment of quality or importance. The process
of determining the state vector is called state estimation or filtering. An observa-
tion is a sensor measurement or combination of measurements. The measurement

286 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
can be direct or indirect. State estimation can provide a more accurate attitude
estimate—one that is statistically optimal.
There are many methods of state estimation based on statistical methods and
estimation theory, many more than can be covered here. However, a brief overview
of the most common methods are presented to aid in the system level design
of the attitude determination system. These methods can be sequential or batch
estimators. A sequential estimator, also called a recursive estimator, obtains a new
state estimate after each observation. A batch estimator processes all observations
concurrently to produce a new estimate of state vector.
There are two types of estimators in common use: least-squares and Kalman
filter. The least-squares method determines the state vector, which minimizes the
square of the difference between observed data and computed data from a dynam-
ics model. An assumption is made that the error or uncertainty has a Gaussian
distribution. This type of estimator can be used either sequentially or by batch.
The Kalman filter method makes a sequential minimum variance estimation. No
assumptions are made about the type of error distribution. This filter is named for
R. E. Kalman who developed this method in the early 1950s.
5.4 Attitude Control Systems
An attitude system is composed of three major parts: 1) attitude sensors, which
provide direct measurements of spacecraft attitude and were discussed in a pre-
ceding section; 2) a feedback control system, which corrects measured attitude to
desired attitude; and 3) actuators, also called effectors or torquers, that provide
the desired control torques. In preceding sections we have seen how the current
attitude of spacecraft, its angular position with respect to a reference system, is
determined. In this section we will describe the process by which known or current
attitude is corrected to the desired attitude. We will first review feedback system
design in general and specifically for a spacecraft. The key element of a feedback
system is the control law, which will be considered in more detail. The actuators,
the hardware elements which drive the spacecraft, will be discussed later.
A spacecraft can have several feedback control systems. This section will deal
with the control of the spacecraft about each of three axes. In many spacecraft
similar three-axis feedback control is also required to point the communications
antenna, science platforms and instruments, solar arrays, and other sensors.
5.4.1 Fundamentals of Feedback Loop Systems
An open-loop control system is one where the desired position is commanded
with no feedback to indicate effectiveness of the commanded action. This method is
used where low precision is required. Examples of open-loop control are as follows:
1) It is common practice to command solar arrays to an angle based on an
ephemeris sun vector.
2) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) station keeping is per-
formed from the ground where an analyst uses trend data to determine the thrusters
and firing duration that are needed for correction. The thruster commands are up-
linked to the spacecraft.
A closed-loop control system, shown in Fig. 5.17, includes a feedback loop
that provides data on the difference between the desired and actual attitude. This

difference is the error signal, which is an input to the control law. The control law
operates to drive the error signal to zero within some limit. The system consists of
the object to be controlled, called the plant (in our case the spacecraft), a reference
input r, control elements g, feedback elements h.
The small circle in Fig. 5.17 is an algebraic summing point; signals arriving at
this point are either added or subtracted. The boxes, or transfer elements, represent
functions, not necessarily hardware elements, of the system. The system operates
to drive the plant output c toward the reference parameter r. Figure 5.17 can readily
be rearranged to describe a spacecraft feedback loop for a single axis as shown in
Fig. 5.18.
In Fig. 5.18 the subscript a indicates actual conditions, r indicates reference,
and e indicates error. The plant, the object operated on, becomes the spacecraft,
and the control element becomes the control law, resident in the computer and
the control actuators. The Feedback Elements box shown in Fig. 5.17 is not
needed for the attitude control diagram (Fig. 5.18) because Oa can be compared
directly with 6r. (In actuality, the 9a signal is filtered and smoothed before it is
compared to the reference angle, but these operations do not affect the feedback
process.)
The angle between the spacecraft axis and the reference coordinate is Oa; the
desired angle is 0r. An error signal is calculated by subtracting Oa from Or. The
error signal is used by the control law to calculate the necessary control torque Tc.
The calculated control torque is generated by an actuator, for example, a reaction
wheel. In a perfect world the calculated control torque would rotate the vehicle to
the reference angle and that would be the end of it. In the real world the control

torque is summed with any disturbance torque present. The sum of the torques Ta
creates vehicle rotation, 9a in accordance with the relation
Ta = IvOa (5.73)
where
Ta = actual torque on the vehicle about a given axis
Iv = moment of inertia of the vehicle about the axis of rotation
Oa = actual rotational acceleration (second derivative of angle with respect to
time) of the vehicle about the given axis
The actual angle is measured, fed back, and compared to the reference angle.
The error caused by the disturbance torque is detected, and the loop repeats. More
complex systems compensate for known errors by including detailed models and
predictive capability to the spacecraft dynamics. For example, thruster alignment
to the control axes is not perfect, causing cross coupling into the other axes. This
misalignment can be measured on the ground, and this knowledge can be included
in the modeling of the spacecraft dynamics to include a compensating torque rather
than sensing the resulting motion and feeding back the error.
The characteristics of the control element and the spacecraft are described by
differential equations as a function of time. The transfer function of the space-
craft can be obtained by taking the Laplace transform of the spacecraft dynamic
equation. The Laplace transform of a linear differential equation has the form of a
polynomial in s, where s is an imaginary number of the form a + ico or a -\-jco.
The function s is sometimes written R(s). The transformed quantities are denoted
by capital letters R, G, H. The ratio of Laplace transform of input to the Laplace
transform of output of a box is called a transfer function.
OIV = Ta (5.74)
Assuming the moment of inertia Iv is constant, the Laplace transform is
Is2C(0) = £(T) (5.75)
Recalling that the feedback transfer function is one, the transfer function G(s) of
the spacecraft element is
,5.76,£(mput) £(T) Is2
A feedback system is stable if its response to a disturbance approaches zero as
time approaches infinity. Alternatively, a stable system can be defined as one that
responds stably to impulses less than a specified magnitude. An attitude control
system is stable if every bounded disturbance produces a bounded response.
The degree of stability is also important. If it is stable, how close to instability
is it? From what angular excursion will it recover? The transforms can be used to
study the stability as well as performance of the control system. Stability is most
frequently studied using Nyquist or Bode analysis. Both are graphical procedures
for determining absolute and relative stability of a feedback system.
The subject of feedback control systems is an extensive and deep topic. There
are numerous references on the subject; notably Refs. 10 and 11. Additional

information on feedback systems as they apply to spacecraft control can be found
in Wertz,9 Agrawal,12 and Kaplan.13
5.4.2 Control Laws
The transfer function of the control element is the control law that relates the
control torque to the error signal. Several basic types of control law are discussed
in this section.
5.4.2.1 Proportional control. The simplest control law is proportional con-
trol, described by
Tr = -K6 (5.77)
where Tc = control torque, K = system gain, and 9 = error signal.
Proportional control is seldom used because it allows large angular excursions.
5.4.2.2 Bang-bang. Another type of proportional control is a bang-bang
controller, which is sometimes used with thruster control. A thruster pulse is output,
and the direction is determined by the sine of the error signal:
Tc = TpsinO (5.78)
Addition of a dead band improves the performance of the simple bang-bang con-
troller (see Fig. 5.19). The error signal is compared to a limit, and a pulse is fired
only if the error exceeds the limit. The region where no firings occur is called the
dead band.

shows the rotation of a spacecraft using bang-bang control with negligible external
torque. As the vehicle rotates, it reaches the limit displacement —0\\m at which point
correcting torque is commanded by firing a selected thruster pair for a selected
duration. The thruster firing stops the rotation of the vehicle at point 1, and the
second half of the burn reverses the vehicle rotation. At the end of the pulse, the
angular acceleration stops, and the vehicle rolls at a constant rate CD until it reaches
the opposite limit +ftim and the process repeats.
During the burn, the vehicle rotated beyond the control limit by an amount A0.
The overshoot magnitude can be found as follows:

5.4.2.4 Phase plane. A more commonly used, and more complicated, con-
trol law for thruster control is the phase plane, shown in Fig. 5.21. The phase plane
can be tailored to avoid large excursions and minimize thruster firings, hence
minimizing propellant usage.
Figure 5.22 shows an actual phase-plane controller for the Magellan X-axis
thrusters. The plane is divided into seven regions. The thruster response is different
for an error in each region. In region 0, the "dead band," there is no thruster response.
In region —1 thrusters 7 and 8 are fired for 11.1 ms; in region +1 the duration
would be the same, but the thrusters selected would be different. As errors increase,
the firing time is increased to provide more correction.

is a position-plus-rate controller, described by

where 6 is the time derivative of the error signal. This control law is also called
position-plus-derivative or a PD controller. In this case the error signal is a position
error, and the time derivative is a rate error. The rate term provides damping and
reduces the angular excursions.

Angular acceleration and angular velocity are actually vector quantities, but so long
as the axis of rotation is fixed their vector properties are not important. Angular
momentum is also a vector quantity, and it is frequently necessary to account for
vector properties.
Maneuver design is also covered, from the propulsion point of view, in
Chapter 4.
5.5.1 Spin-Stabilized Spacecraft
For a spin-stabilized spacecraft a maneuver consists of reorienting the spin axis.
Reorientation of the spin axis constitutes a change in the direction of the momen-
tum vector, as shown in Fig. 5.23.

The pulse width / must be short compared to the period of spin. A pulse during an
entire revolution would result in Ha = 0.
The spin axis will continue to precess until a second pulse of equal magnitude
and opposite direction is fired. The spin axis can be repositioned by selecting the
timing of the second pulse.
5.5.2 Three-Axis-Stabilized Maneuvers
In a three-axis-stabilized system an attitude maneuver consists of rotations about
each of the spacecraft axes. The rotation about each axis consists of three parts:
1) angular acceleration, 2) coasting, and 3) braking.
Angular acceleration is produced by a thruster pair firing or by reaction wheels;
braking is caused by a firing of the opposite pair or reversing the reaction wheel
torque. Figure 5.24 shows a one-axis maneuver controlled by thrusters.
The total angle of rotation is
Om = $ (accelerating) + $ (coasting) + # (braking)
The time tb is usually fixed and is determined by the capability of the actuator. If
the actuator is a thruster pair, then the torque produced is

If the actuator is a reaction wheel, the torque produced is
T = Iwoiw (5.97)
where Iw is the moment of inertial of the reaction wheel and aw the angular accel-
eration of the wheel. The acceleration of the wheel and duration of acceleration
will be limited by the wheel inertia and maximum speed. The torque produced by
thrusters is limited by the engine thrust level and by the moment arm. The time tb
required for a given acceleration is
fc = - = £ (5.98)a T

where tm is the maneuver time. Substituting for tb and solving for tm yields

Alternatively, the largest maneuver that can be performed in a fixed time interval
has a zero coast time, and

0 = H-^tl (5.102)
Note that the maneuver time is twice the burn time.
Additional information concerning maneuver design can be obtained from the
propulsion system requirements section.
Example 5.7 Reaction Wheel Maneuver
A spacecraft has three reaction wheels aligned with the body axes. The inertias
are as follows.
Spacecraft:
Ix = 1500kg-m2 Iy = 1500kg-m2 Iz = 2000 kg-m2
Reaction wheels:
/„; =0.06 kg-m2
The wheels produce 0.18 N-m of torque each. Of the total storage capacity of
25 N-m-s, 15 N-m-s are allocated to maneuvers. (The remaining 10 N-m-s are
allocated to momentum storage.)

Acceleration is limited by the greatest inertia Iz :

The maximum rotation rate is
a) = at = (9 x 10~5)(83.3) = 7.5 x 10~3 rad/s
To this point one-axis maneuvers have been discussed. Most spacecraft maneuvers
require rotation about three axes, and often the spacecraft activity requires three-
axis maneuvers to a new position and three-axis maneuvers to return to normal
attitude. Consider for example a Magellan star scan maneuver. The normal attitude
for Magellan was nadir pointing for acquiring surface images of Venus. Once per
orbit (every 3.15 h) it made a three-axis maneuver to point at a given star. It then
made a roll such that the star scanner crossed the star position. The two-axis data
from the star scanner were used to update the gyros while the spacecraft made a
three-axis maneuver to return to nadir pointing.
There are always constraints on the attitudes the spacecraft is allowed to take.
These constraints come from requirements such as 1) keeping bright objects, sun
and planet, from the star scanner field of view, or camera field of view; 2) keeping
the solar panels pointed at the sun; 3) keeping the high-gain antenna pointed at
the ground station; and 4) keeping rotation within gyro constraints. Maneuvers
must be designed to rotate all axes without violating these exclusion zones. In
addition, there are often time constraints on maneuver; for example, maneuvers
for star scanning are timed for the star to be in rough position, and maneuvers to
accomplish planetary orbit insertion have tight time limits.
5.6 Attitude Control Hardware
In this section, the specialized equipment used in an attitude control system is
described. This information provides the reader with the general performance of
current equipment for student designs and the like. The performance of aerospace
equipment like this changes rapidly with time; for current design information
you should contact the equipment manufacturers. Note also that by no means all
of the equipment manufacturers are included here and the names and corporate
affiliations of these manufacturers are changing rapidly.
Attitude control requires three types of specialized equipment:
1) Sensors are used to measure attitude of the spacecraft with respect to known
quantities such as the sun, stars, or Earth.
2) Actuators are used to provide a torque to the spacecraft to correct measured
attitude to desired attitude.
3) Computers are used to perform the sensor processing, attitude determination,
control law, attitude, and maneuver calculations.

5.6.1 Sensors
Sensors provide "sensed" data about the position of the spacecraft relative to
known quantities. A spacecraft uses sensors to 1) detect and measure rotation about
three axes, 2) locate the spacecraft-sun vector, 3) measure rotational and linear
acceleration, and 4) detect or track stars.
Typical sensors and performance are compared in Table 5.7.
As already discussed, a satellite using a spin-stabilized attitude control system
will employ a sun sensor, horizon sensor, or a star scanner. Typically, a combina-
tion of at least two of the three sensors is used to provide more information and
to provide an alternate data source when data are not available such as eclipse-
causing sun-sensor outages. Gyros are rarely used on a spin-stabilized satellite
because repetitive measurements from the inertial sensors provide the spin rate to
a sufficient accuracy.
A three-axis-stabilized spacecraft uses a combination of inertial sensors and rate
sensors. One typical configuration would be gyros, a star tracker, and sun sensors.
A combination of gyros and sun sensors would be used for attitude acquisitions
and safe-hold mode, which requires lower accuracy. The gyros and star tracker
would be used for the primary mode with the gyros propagating attitude based
on sensed rate between star measurements. Another typical configuration replaces
the star tracker with horizon sensors.
As the sensors, algorithms, and computers become more sophisticated and ca-
pable, it becomes possible to rely on a star camera or horizon sensors only for long
periods of time. Rate information is reduced from successive readings of the iner-
tial sensor when the spacecraft is relatively quiescent. The higher bandwidths now
available and greater computing power, especially image processing, make these
advances possible. Usually, this configuration is flown for power savings because
gyros require a large amount of power relative to inertial sensors. However, gyros

are still included to accommodate maneuvers, which still require the higher rate
capability.
5.6.1.1 Rate sensors. Gyros are precision instruments that detect small
rotations with respect to inertial space. Spacecraft gyros have a small angular
range and high accuracy as opposed to aircraft instrument gyros, which have a
wide range and low accuracy. Gyros operate on the basic principle that when a
torque is applied to a spinning wheel the wheel precesses. Figure 5.25 shows the
precession torque T caused by force F on a spinning wheel.
The axes that describe precession are the spin axis, the torque axis, and the pre-
cession axis. The angular velocity vector and the momentum vector are aligned with
the spin axis; the vector direction is determined by the right-hand rule. Precession
is in the direction of torque (see Fig. 5.25), as is the angular acceleration of the
wheel. If the wheel in Fig. 5.25 were a single-axis gyro, the torque axis would
be called the input axis and the precession axis would be called the output axis.
The angular rate of precession a)p is directly proportional to the input torque and
inversely proportional to the momentum of the gyro,

Inertial systems. Gyros can be used in two major ways to effect attitude control:
1) Gyros and accelerometers are mounted on a servo-driven stable-platform;
gyro output is used to keep the platform inertially fixed. Vehicle control infor-
mation is obtained in inertial coordinates by comparison with the stable platform
position.
2) The increasingly more popular method uses strap-down gyros, which are fixed
to the spacecraft body. The gyros read disturbance in body-fixed coordinates, and
the ACS computer is used to relate body-fixed output to inertial reference frame.
A strap-down system offers hardware simplicity, less power and weight at a cost
of computational complexity.

Gyros are not usually bought individually but are packaged with electronics.
Gyro performance is a combination of the sensitivity of the instrument, the range
of the instrument, and the magnitude of the error sources and is determined by the
type of gyro and its electronics. The sensitivity is usually inversely proportional
to the range. Some units compensate for this problem by having selectable modes
for high rate, with lower sensitivity, and low rate with higher sensitivity. Recent
advances in technology have made many types of high-quality gyros available
from a wide selection of vendors.
Gyro errors or drift. Gyro errors or drift result from imperfections in the
gyro. Some forms of drift are proportional to acceleration or acceleration squared.
These are important during thrusting flight or high rate maneuvers. These errors
are specified as scale-factor error and are calculated as the difference between
the measured angle of rotation and the known angle. These errors are quantified
during unit calibration, but they can change or drift over the lifetime and may
require periodic measurement in flight. Gyro bias stability is a measure of noise in
the gyro. Conceptually, the gyro should have zero output if the spacecraft is holding
perfectly still, but because all gyros have some type of moving parts there is some
signal or bias. This bias changes over time. The amount that the bias changes is
specified as the bias stability. A third type of error is specified as random walk and
is exactly what the name implies, a random error.
Some repeatable forms of drift can be measured and removed by calibra-
tion corrections. The random forms of drift require periodic measurement and
updates to remove. Stellar reference is the most common method of absolute
reference for gyro update. For example, the Magellan spacecraft used a star cal-
ibration, which consisted of a three-axis maneuver to place the roll axis perpen-
dicular to the expected position of the chosen guide star. A roll maneuver then
swept the star scanner across predetermined stars providing a star update, which
was compared to the predicted star position to provide an estimate of gyro bias
drift. Special calibrations are required to separate bias error from scale-factor
error.
Gyro drift is an important consideration when choosing the ACS hardware.
How much drift can be tolerated depends on how the gyro data will be used
in conjunction with the other sensors onboard. If the gyros will be relied upon
to propagate attitude during other sensor outages, then high performance with a
low drift rate would be indicated. Once the measurement performance require-
ment is established, other considerations such as power, mass, and lifetime need
to be considered.
One-degree-of-freedom gyros. Figure 5.26 is a schematic of a one-degree-of-
freedom gyro; it has a single gimbal, which is free to rotate about the output axis
and is otherwise fixed. The reference axis is body fixed and coincident with the
gyro spin axis at null. The gyro input axis is also body fixed and is perpendicular
to the reference axis and the output axis. Gyro input is a rotation of the case
about the input axis, shown as the spacecraft x axis in Fig. 5.26. This rotation is
transmitted to the wheel and axle through the gimbal bearings and constitutes a
forced precession of the gyro, which causes a rotation 9 about the output axis. The
instrument measures the error angle, which can then be used to correct the error.
Depending on the way disturbing torque error is handled, the gyro is termed an

Floated gyros can sense rates as small as 0.015 deg/h and were used on the Apollo,
Polaris, Titan, IUS, and Peacekeeper. The Titan III inertial guidance system used
a rate-integrating, strap-down, one-degree-of-freedom, floated gyro; the rotor was
2 in. in diameter, weighed about 2 Ib, and rotated at 24,000 rpm.
Two-degree-of-freedom gyro. Figure 5.27 is a schematic of a two-degree-of-
freedom gyro. The gyro wheel is set on bearings in the inner gimbal. The inner
gimbal is set in bearings in the outer gimbal, which in turn is set in bearings in
the gyro case. The gimbal arrangement allows the case rotational freedom with
respect to the inner gimbal. The motion of the inner gimbal is measured in two
sensitive axes with respect to the case. Any small motion about the sensitive axes
(x and y in Fig. 5.27) is measured and used to correct the disturbing torques.
Two-degree-of-freedom gyros use a variety of designs to reduce friction and,
hence, improve accuracy. The electrostatic gyro uses a spherical beryllium
rotor that rotates at 100,000 rpm and is supported electromagnetically in a cav-
ity to reduce friction. Aircraft and submarine systems use this type of gyro.

A gas-bearing gyro uses a spherical rotor supported in a cavity by a thin layer of
gas under pressure. Gas-bearing gyros were used on the Minuteman IMU. A dry-
tuned gyro spins at the precise frequency at which the forces and torques offset
each other, leaving a nearly frictionless system. The Trident, Space Shuttle, and
Magellan use dry-tuned gyros.
Ring-laser gyro. The ring-laser gyro is more recent technology that promises
greater reliability; there are few moving parts and greater stability because they
use spinning light instead of spinning mass. The gyro detects and measures angu-
lar rates by measuring the frequency difference between two contrarotating laser
beams (see Fig. 5.28). The two laser beams circulate in a triangular cavity si-
multaneously. Mirrors are used to reflect the beam around an enclosed area. The
resonant frequency of a contained laser beam is a function of its optical path length.

Consequently, the two laser beams have identical frequencies when the gyros are at
rest. When the gyro is subjected to an angular rotation around an axis perpendicular
to the plane of the two beams, one beam then has a longer optical path, and the other
beam has a shorter optical path. Therefore, the two resonant frequencies change,
and the frequency differential is directly proportional to the angular turning rate.
The frequency difference is measured by optical means, resulting in a digital output.
Pulse rate is proportional to the input angular rate, and the pulse count is a measure
of the angle turned.
There are two main design variants on Fig. 5.28. Fiber-optic laser paths can be
used; in this design the optic path can be made very long, without awkward unit
geometry, by coiling the fiber. Many turns can be used. The other major variant
produces a phase difference between the two laser beams rather than a frequency
difference.
Honey well International, Inc. uses their ring laser gyros as the basis for their
miniature inertial measurement unit (MIMU), which provides temperature com-
pensated three axis angular rate output. The radiation-hardened inertial reference
unit (IRU) contains three orthogonal gyros with an available inertial measurement

power inputs range from 28 vdc with telemetry on/off commands. The IMU is cur-
rently flying on the Odyssey and the Stardust spacecraft. The radiation hardened

Hemispherical resonator gyro. The hemispherical resonator gyro (HRG) is
another advanced gyro concept that offers small volume and mass along with
simple operation and no wearout components. The operating principle is shown
in Fig. 5.30. The unit consists of a hemispherical resonator that is driven at
its resonant frequency. Disturbance torques produce measurable changes in the
resonance pattern of the hemisphere, which are detected by a collar surrounding
the resonator.
The HRG can be configured to operate as a rate gyro or an integrating gyro. It
flew on the NEAR spacecraft and is currently flying on the Cassini spacecraft.
Accelerometers. All spacecraft linear thrusting maneuvers require accurate
velocity change measurement for the shutdown signal. There are three ways of
controlling the burn: 1) use a calibrated propulsion system and time the burn,
2) measure acceleration on the ground from range rate, 3) measure acceleration
onboard. Onboard accelerometers are the most common approach. An accelero-
meter (Fig. 5.31) is a relatively simple instrument that measures force on a known
mass.

5.6.1.2 Inertial sensors. Star scanners. Star scanners are rotated past the
calculated position of a guide star. The difference between the calculated position
and the measured position of the guide star is used to calculate an attitude update.
Figure 5.32 shows a schematic of a star scanner.
As the scanner is rotated across the spacecraft-star vector, light enters the optical
shade and passes through the slit pattern to the sensor photomultiplier tube, which
produces a pulse as the star passes each slit. The radial position of the star in the roll
plane is given by the leading edge of the first pulse. The star position perpendicular
to the roll plane is given by the time between pulses.
Star trackers. A star tracker is more like a camera using a charge-coupled
device (CCD) array. It provides a horizontal and vertical position (in tracker coor-
dinates), which is then converted to a position error. Trackers can provide infor-
mation about several stars simultaneously. The term "tracker" refers to the ability
to provide continuous position updates as the star moves through the instruments
field of view (see Fig. 5.33). Star trackers require an a priori estimate of attitude
in order to identify the stars in the field of view.
Star cameras. The Clementine spacecraft was the first to fly a star camera, a
new inertial sensor, which uses a CCD combined with image processing performed
in the onboard computer. The star camera observes a segment of sky and deduces
position by pattern matching. It is not necessary to scan or track given stars and

therefore requires no a priori knowledge. The characteristics of the Clementine
OCA star camera are field of view, 28.9 x 43.4 deg; accuracy, 96 arc-sec; weight,
1.2kg.
Sun sensors. Sun sensors are a wide-angle measurement used primarily to
point solar panels or in attitude initialization. They are a much smaller, more
rugged instrument than star scanners. They weigh about 0.3 kg and consume
about 0.5 W continuously. Magellan used one on each panel. The operation of a
typical sun sensor is shown in Fig. 5.34. The reticule pattern is designed to convert
the sunlight line entering the instrument into a digital code representing the sun
angle within 0.25 deg.
Horizon sensors. Horizon sensors are particularly useful for finding the nadir
vector (see Fig. 5.35). Horizon scanners are an infrared (IR) sensing instrument;
the location of the horizon is sensed by the dramatic difference in IR emission
of the Earth disk and cold deep space. Because they are a scanning instrument,
they are particularly suitable for spinning spacecraft; if they are used on a three-
axis spacecraft, the instrument must have a scanning head. Used in pairs they can
provide nadir within about 0.1 deg. They weigh about 2-7 kg and require 5-10 W.

Global positioning system receiver. The advent of the global positioning sys-
tem (GPS) provides spacecraft with a small, light, very accurate instrument for
determining position. (Technically, position determination is navigation rather than
attitude control, however, the instrument is usually assigned to the ACS system.)
The GPS receiver used on the SNOE spacecraft is typical; its characteristics are
as follows: mass, 3.2 kg; power, 2.1 W (SNOE reduced average power by using
the instrument intermittently); size, 2.5 x 4.5 x 2.0 in.
5.6.2 Actuators
5.6.2.1 Wheels. Several types of rotating flywheels are used in attitude
control systems. These are all similar in construction but are used in different
ways to provide stiffness to resist disturbing torques, to exchange momentum to
correct error, to allow operation at one revolution per orbit for Earth-oriented
missions, to absorb cyclic torques, and to transfer momentum to spacecraft for
slewing maneuvers. Each type is described in this section.
Control moment gyros. Control moment gyros (CMG) are gimbaled wheels
spinning at a constant rate. A commanded force on the input axis of the gyro causes
a control torque to the spacecraft on the output axis. They are larger and heav-
ier than reaction wheels and consume more power. Skylab used control moment
gyros; they are seldom used on smaller spacecraft because of weight and power
requirements.
Momentum wheels. Momentum wheels are flywheels designed to operate at
a biased, nonzero speed. Momentum is exchanged with the wheel by changing
wheel speed. They are usually body fixed. Momentum wheels and reaction wheels
differ only in speed bias. INTELSAT VIII used momentum wheels.
Reaction wheels. Reaction wheels (see Fig. 5.36) are simply small flywheels
powered by a dc motor, which exchanges momentum with the spacecraft by chang-
ing wheel speed. For example, when a clockwise disturbance torque is imposed
on the spacecraft the attitude control system holds spacecraft attitude constant by
rotating a reaction wheel counterclockwise. In the reverse case the spacecraft can
be rotated by using the dc motor to slow wheel speed and cause the spacecraft to

rotate. Reaction wheels are particularly suited to situations that require positive
and negative sets of momentum exchanges, for example, limit-cycle maneuvers or
a maneuver from cruise attitude to target and return to cruise attitude. For maneu-
vers of this type, momentum is borrowed from the wheels and then returned to the
wheels. Except for wheel friction there is no net loss of momentum.
Momentum exchanges are very efficient; however, eventually the wheel momen-
tum must be adjusted by changing wheel speed. Also situations with a constant
disturbance torque, solar pressure for example, result in constant wheel speed in-
crease to hold the spacecraft. Typically wheel speed is reduced (momentum is
"dumped") by holding the spacecraft stationary with thrusters, or magnetic tor-
quers, while the dc motor reduces wheel speed.
If reaction wheels are placed on each of the three principle spacecraft axes, the
control law for each axis will be linear; however, it is common practice to provide
wheel redundancy by placing a fourth wheel in a position oblique to all axes. With
this arrangement any single wheel failure can be accommodated by the oblique
wheel, which is far more efficient than providing three redundant wheels. The
control law for oblique wheel will be slightly more complex and nonlinear. The
wheel control laws must be designed to avoid wheel operation near 0 rpm. Wheel
friction is nonlinear in this region, and wheel motion becomes jerky and imparts
an attitude error. This effect is sometimes called "stiction."
Reaction wheels have a deep application heritage and come in many sizes,
ranging from the HR01 from Honey well International, Inc. used on DSCS
(1.9 N-m-s momentum and 0.05 N-m output torque) to the large HR195 (264
N-m-s momentum and 0.7 N-m torque) used on the Hubble Space Telescope. A
sample of a wide selection of current production wheels from Honeywell Interna-
tional, Inc. is shown in Table 5.8.
Torque rods. Torque rods take advantage of the Earth's magnetic field to gen-
erate a correcting force on a spacecraft. A torque rod is simply a wire coil wrapped
around a rod, usually a few centimeters in diameter and about a meter in length.
When a current is sent through the coil a torque is generated by the interaction of

Magnetic torquers are very useful for momentum management, often in con-
junction with reaction wheels. Over 100 low-Earth orbiters have used magnetic
torquers; these include SAGE, NIMBUS, LANDSAT, SATCOM, Iridium, and
Globalstar. Their usefulness decreases with orbit altitude, as the Earth's magnetic
field decreases. They are not useable for deep space missions.
For a small spacecraft directly inserted into LEO, propulsion can be avoided
by using the magnetic torquers to provide momentum desaturation to the reaction
wheels, eliminating an entire subsystem. The SOURCE spacecraft design takes
advantage of this configuration.
5.6.2.2 Thrasters. Most spacecraft use thrusters as actuators; they provide
momentum to the spacecraft by ejecting mass overboard in the form of high velocity
exhaust gas. Three types of thrusters are in use: 1) cold gas, 2) monopropellant
hydrazine, 3) bipropellant. Cold-gas systems are the simplest and are used for
small spacecraft with impulse requirements of a few hundreds newtons/second.
Bipropellant systems are the most expensive and complex; they are used for trajec-
tory control and infrequently for attitude control. The dominant choice is mono-
propellant hydrazine, which gives midrange specific impulse with a simple system.
It requires 12 thrusters to provide pure moments about three axes. More detailed
information is given in Chapter 4.
Thrusters can be used directly to control the spacecraft attitude or used as mo-
mentum desaturation actuators for the reaction wheels. Primary thruster control
can be very costly in terms of propellant mass if there are noticeable disturbance
torques.
5.6.3 Computers
Computers are necessary for the attitude control system and for the data handling
system. They are discussed in Chapter 8.
The decision of a central computer for both C&DH and attitude control vs
individual computers for each subsystem is a significant early trade in the spacecraft
design process. The considerations are as follows:
1) A central computer is lighter and cheaper.
2) A central computer is a simpler system from the hardware standpoint; how-
ever, the software system may be more complex.
3) The dominant requirements of the two systems are different. The attitude
control system needs a very fast computer; the data system needs large memory and

file handling features. Specialized computers offer better performance; a central
computer is a performance compromise.
4) Two different computers make a more comprehensive fault protection sys-
tem possible. The ACS computer can monitor the C&DH computer and vice
versa. To take full advantage of cross monitoring requires redundant computers of
each type so that a failed computer can be taken off line. A fault protection sys-
tem that incorporates cross monitoring requires substantially more complicated
software.
As computers become more and more capable and able to perform more cal-
culations faster, the attitude control software has become more capable and more
complex. The amount of data processed from the various sensors and the attitude
determination methods used to process that data have increased in size and com-
plexity. These advances have led to the increased importance of the attitude control
software development and testing.
5.6.4 Example Systems
The hardware selections made by four flight systems are described in this section.
5.6.4.1 Space Shuttle Orbiter. 1) Attitude sensing consists of three inde-
pendent inertial platforms, each with four fixed-rate gyros and four fixed accelero-
meters, and two star trackers.
2) Computers needed are three dedicated computers and two backup computers.
3) Control involves three gimbaled main engines (10.5-deg pitch, 8.5-deg yaw),
throttleable (65 to 109%); two orbital maneuvering systems, each with 26,700 N
engines, gimbaled (6-deg pitch, 7-deg yaw) and 44 control thrusters, 38 at 3870 N
each and 6 at 100 N each.
5.6.4.2 Inertial upper stage. 1) Attitude sensing consists of redundant
inertial measuring units, each with five rate-integrating one-degree-of-freedom,
gas-bearing gyros; five linear accelerometers; and one star scanner to update the
gyros.
2) Computers needed are two redundant computers.
3) Control involves gimbaled first- and second-stage solid rocket motors and 12
monopropellant thrusters.
5.6.4.3 Stardust. 1) Attitude sensing consists of three ring-laser gyros used
only for trajectory maneuvers and comet encounter; one star camera (+ one
redundant) for inertial attitude determination "all stellar"; and two analog sun
sensors for backup modes.
2) Computers needed are redundant all-purpose onboard computers RAD6000.
3) Control involves eight 0.9 N thrusters for attitude control and eight 4.5 N
thrusters for trajectory maneuvers and backup control for comet encounter.

tion control, with deployment through geosynchronous orbit insertion and three-
axis-stabilized nadir pointing momentum bias during on station operation to
0.017 deg.

Power System
The power system supplies the life blood of the spacecraft. As long as the
spacecraft has power, it can perform its mission. Almost all other failures can be
worked around by ground operations, but a loss of power is a fatal heart attack
for the spacecraft. In the early years of spaceflight, the power system was also the
limiting factor in mission duration. Sputnik I consisted of a structure, a battery,
a transmitter, and an antenna. The highly successful mission lasted exactly as
long as the battery: 21 days. Explorer I, the first U.S. spacecraft, lasted longer
but also ended abruptly with battery depletion. One-shot battery systems of the
type Sputnik and Explorer I used are called primary batteries for reasons lost in
space history. The short duration of time provided by primary batteries was clearly
unsatisfactory for most missions. Solar panels were developed to convert the sun's
energy into power, and solar panel-battery power systems became the backbone
of unmanned spacecraft design from 1959 to the present.
As planetary missions outbound beyond Mars were considered, it became nec-
essary to develop power sources independent of solar energy because of the great
solar distances involved. (Recall that incident solar energy decreases as the square
of the distance from the sun.) The development of radioisotope thermoelectric
generators (RTGs) resulted. RTGs convert the energy released by the decay of a
radioisotope into electrical power. The power levels of an RTG are moderate, but the
life of an RTG is very long, depending only on the half-life of the radioisotope used.
Nuclear reactors were briefly considered as a power source, providing both high
power and long life. The former Soviet Union flew nuclear reactors on a routine
basis; the United States flew only one experimental system, the SNAP 10A, in
1965. The system was a mercury-Rankine-cycle and operated successfully at full
power generating 500,000 W-h electrical. The limiting factor in the use of reactors
and RTGs is the human and political consequences of nuclear safety.
Manned systems require large amounts of power for short durations. Fuel cells
are the system of choice for Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle for this require-
ment. Fuel cells derive electrical power from the energy released in the reaction
of oxygen and hydrogen to form water. One method is to release the chemicals
through porous rods into an aqueous solution. The reaction takes place at the
electrodes, ions migrate through the solution, and electrical power flows through
external circuits attached to the porous rods. The operating regimes of these basic
power sources are depicted in Fig. 6.1.
A typical unmanned solar panel-battery power system is shown in Fig. 6.2.
When the spacecraft is in the sun, power is generated by photoelectric conversion
of sunlight in the cells of the solar panel. The power is distributed directly to all of
the loads on the spacecraft, and a portion is diverted to the battery for charging. The
battery charger controls the rate at which the batteries are recharged. This process
is more complicated than you might think and is discussed in more detail later.

POWER SYSTEM 317
Fig. 6.3 Peak power tracker architecture.
The shunt regulator diverts any excess power from the bus to the shunt radiator to
be radiated into space. When the spacecraft is in the shade, power from the solar
panels drops to zero, and power is taken from the batteries to spacecraft loads.
The shunt regulator and battery charging functions shown in Fig. 6.2 are normally
packaged with other control functions in a power control unit, which also controls
the voltage levels on the bus or buses, and turns power on and off to specific items of
equipment [at the command of the command and data system (CDS)]. This general
architecture is called a direct energy transfer system (DET) because power is sent
directly from the solar panels to the loads without intervening control equipment.
Direct energy transfer is the most common power system type.
Geosynchronous communication spacecraft sometimes use a variant of the DET
system, segregated a portion of the solar array for battery charging and the remain-
der of the array for spacecraft loads. The characteristics of the geosynchronous
day/night cycle make it an attractive alternative, as will be shown later.
Some spacecraft use a different architecture called a peak power tracker (PPT).
The system schematic is similar to a direct energy transfer system with the addition
of a peak power tracker box between the solar panels and the loads (see Fig. 6.3).
The peak power tracker holds the solar panel output voltage on peak power point of
the cells. The PPT system delivers the maximum power that the panels can provide
at the expense of additional complexity, additional power loss from the panels to
the loads, and potential failure modes in series with the main power bus. Peak
power tracker architecture is used infrequently and usually on smaller spacecraft.
Subsequent sections will describe the steps in the preliminary design of a power
system, which are as follows:
1) Select the power source, as just described.
2) Establish the power requirements, which are described in Section 6.1:
a) determine power consumption for each mission mode; b) prepare an energy
balance for each mode; c) set the requirements for the power source, usually solar
arrays; and d) set the requirements for the battery system.
3) Size the solar arrays or RTGs; see Section 6.2.
4) Size the battery system; see Section 6.3.
5) Establish requirements for power distribution and control; see Section 6.4.
6) Prepare mass and power estimates for the power system; see Section 6.5.
7) Conduct trade studies in search of design improvements, and refine the power
requirements.

318 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
6.1 Power System Requirements
In this section the functional requirements, power budgets, power margins, en-
ergy balance, and derived requirements for battery and solar panel are discussed.
6.1.1 Functional Requirements
Beyond the obvious requirement to generate and store power, the functions of
a power system are as follows:
1) Regulate power. It would be ideal, from a power system standpoint, if none
of the payload instruments or spacecraft equipment required voltage regulation
more exact than the unregulated dc bus provides, normally about 24 to 33 V. This
range is clearly adequate for most equipment and for all heaters, but probably
not for the spacecraft computers and possibly not for the payload instruments.
Usually a spacecraft requires a regulated bus as well as an unregulated bus. Some
equipment may require ac, which would entail an inverter and an ac bus be added
to the power system. (The Magellan power system supplied 50 ± 1.5 V ac at
2.4 kHz to the CDS.)
2) Distribute power. The task of distributing power entails running wiring from
each power relay in the power control system to each piece of equipment to be
powered. The result is a set of cable bundles routed to every corner of the spacecraft.
To appreciate how difficult it is to do this job well, look at the cable mess behind
your computer.
3) Provide power margin. It is essential to provide power margin over and beyond
usage at worst anticipated conditions. This important topic is discussed in detail
in Chapter 2, "System Engineering." Power margin is also necessary during the
mission to accommodate unplanned situations or maneuvers. It is not acceptable
to power down essential equipment to achieve in-flight margin. Most electronic
failures occur at power turn on. The best practice is to turn it on and leave it on.
4) Establish uninterruptable power. There can be no physical means to remove
power from the bus. In addition, it must be physically impossible to remove all
batteries from the bus. A Mars-bound spacecraft was lost by inadvertent opening
of a main power switch in flight. All power was lost, including power to the
command receiver. There is no way to recover from this condition; an otherwise
healthy spacecraft was lost. Inability to turn power off is an inconvenience during
ground test, but it is an essential requirement.
5) Run ground cable. It is highly desirable to run ground cable rather than
grounding through the structure because it is difficult to maintain low resistance
throughout the structural joints. In either case it is necessary to maintain electrical
continuity between structural elements and between thermal blankets.
6) Keep memory alive. Under all circumstances power must be supplied to the
computer memories and data memories. A power loss to the memories would
be difficult and dangerous, if not impossible, for the Mission Operations team to
repair.
7) Perform equipment switching. All equipment on the spacecraft that can be
switched on and off is switched by the power system using banks of relays. Switch-
ing should be done on the positive side with the negative side hard wired. When
the CDS reads a command to shut down a given piece of equipment, a camera,
for example, the command is sent to the power system, which opens the proper

POWER SYSTEM 319
relay to remove power from the camera. Note that there is a class of equipment
which can never be turned off, for example, the power system and the memory just
mentioned. This critical equipment is hard wired to power.
8) Establish fuse protection. The fuses for all spacecraft equipment are contained
in the power system.
9) Establish an emergency load shed. If the bus voltage drops below a given
number (usually 24 V), it is assumed that there is a short somewhere in the system.
In this case all noncritical loads are shed (powered off) automatically, and an
emergency message is sent to the Mission Operations team. The loads to be shed
are preselected during the design phase.
10) Establish power on reset (FOR). If power has been removed, as already
described, and subsequently reset, an unambiguous message must be appended to
the engineering data stream for the next download.
11) Regulate pyrotechnic firing. All of the pyrotechnic devices on the
spacecraft—explosive nuts, squib valves, separation ordinance, and the like—are
fired from the power system. The usual sequence of events is as follows: a) com-
mand to arm ordnance is issued by the CDS, and the power system closes relays
making firing of the ordnance device possible; and b) command to fire ordnance is
issued by the CDS, usually based on a time tick from the spacecraft clock, then the
relay that sends power to the ordinance device is closed; the power firing circuits
usually are redundant such that each pyro device receives firing current from two
independent sources.
6.1.2 System Level Considerations
The characteristics of some representative flight power systems are shown in
Table 6.1.
Table 6.1 is arranged in order of flight date with older systems on the left
progressing to more modern systems on the right. There are three key observations
to be made from Table 6.1:
1) Silicon solar cells were the work horses of the first three decades of the space
age. They are now being replaced in flight systems by gallium arsenide (GaAs)
cells, which offer greater energy conversion efficiency and higher temperature
limits.
2) Similarly, nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries have been the batteries of choice
and are now being replaced by nickel-hydrogen (NiH^) cells, which offer improved
cycle life and reduced mass. NiH2 batteries were first used on communications
spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit where battery cycling is at a minimum; they
are now being used in low Earth orbit, which requires higher cycle life. There are
two types on NiH2 cells: individual pressure vessels (IPV) and common pressure
vessels (CPV) with CPV the lightest and latest design.
3) Most spacecraft use direct current only. A few require ac and, as result, require
an inverter.
All of the spacecraft in Table 6.1 are three-axis stabilized except Pioneer Venus,
which was spin stabilized. Three-axis systems can point the panels directly at the
sun continuously. Spin-stabilized spacecraft can not readily provide sun-pointed
panels. The common design solution is to place the spin axis perpendicular to the
sun and put the solar cells on a drum-shaped exterior (see Fig. 6.4). With a drum
spinner the solar cells are in and out of the sun each revolution. With this design the

solar cells produce l/n times, or about one-third, as much power as a sun-pointed
panel of the same. High-power missions are difficult for a spinning spacecraft.
6. 1.3 Spacecraft Total Power Consumption
The primary power system requirement is the power consumption of the space-
craft during each mission mode. In the early stages of a design, the total spacecraft
power requirement is not available; however, it can be estimated from pay load
power, which is usually known. In this section we will consider estimating re-
lationships from which early estimates of total spacecraft power can be made.
These data are based on prior spacecraft designs and by their very nature do not
take in account improvements in technology; however, they are useful in the early
phases where there is little else to go on. Figure 6.5 shows a power-estimating
relationship between payload power and total spacecraft power for 40 spacecraft
of various missions.
The best statistical fit of the data in Fig. 6.5 is
Pt = U3Ppi + 122 (6.1)
where
Pt = total spacecraft power to the load, including payload power, W
Ppl — payload power, W
6.1.3.1 ComsatS. Figure 6.5 considers all spacecraft without regard to the
mission. An improvement in prediction accuracy can be obtained by separating
spacecraft into types by mission, specifically, communication, meteorological,
planetary spacecraft. Figure 6.6 shows payload power vs total power for 10 com-
munication spacecraft. A linear regression fit of the data from Fig. 6.6 yields the
following relation for communication spacecraft:

total power for three inner planetary spacecraft.
A regression fit of the data from Fig. 6.8 yields the following relation for total
power and payload power for planetary spacecraft:

In summary, Table 6.2 shows the spacecraft power estimating relationships.
As a spacecraft design progresses, the early power estimates made with the
relations in Table 6.2 will be replaced with data from the design process. The
purpose of Table 6.2 is to provide a rational starting point for the design. For
metsats with payload power less than 150 W, use the "All missions" estimating
relationship from Table 6.2.

6.1.4 Subsystem Power Consumption
Once an estimate has been made for the total spacecraft power requirement, the
total power available to the subsystems can be obtained:
Psubsystems = Pt - Ppl (6.5)
Subsystem total power can be allocated to each subsystem on a historical percent-
age basis as shown in Table 6.3.
In Table 6.3, cable losses are included in the power system allotment. For com-
munication satellites the engineering and command communication equipment
is included in the command and data (CDS) system. (In the communication satellite
industry the command and data system is generally called the TT&H subsystem.)
Power allocations from Table 6.3 provide a starting point for the design process.
These allocations will be refined as the design progresses.
6.7.5 Mission Modes
Subsystem power allocations and reserves must be made for each mission mode.
Every spacecraft has at least four mission modes: 1) launch, 2) postseparation,
3) daytime, and 4) nighttime. Daytime and nighttime are also called full sun and
eclipse phases. The allocations from Table 6.3 are full sun power allocations. Dur-
ing nighttime, the thermal control power must be increased substantially to account
for additional heater power; a factor of two is a good initial estimate. The remaining
subsystems probably remain at the daytime levels. The daytime allocations must
account for battery charging power, not shown in Table 6.3. Battery charging power

can be added as a separate line item or added to the power subsystem allocation;
the former is better practice. All spacecraft have a power mode associated with
the launch vehicle ride. Typically the in-shroud mode is a low power level, which
is provided, all or in part, by the launch vehicle. After separation from the launch
vehicle, the spacecraft has a number of chores to perform in rapid order before
the solar panels can be deployed and pointed to the sun. The battery energy must
provide all of the power required for this postseparation period, which is not
necessarily short.
As the design progresses, numerous other modes will be added, downlink-on
and downlink-off, for example. In the late phases of a program, the power modes
become so numerous that an analytical model is usually built, which will deter-
mine the power consumption in complex spacecraft maneuvers with individual
equipment items switched on or off.
Table 6.4 is the power summary table for Magellan showing three of the mission
modes.
6.1.6 Power Margin
No power budget is complete without margins. In the earliest phases of the
spacecraft design, the loads will be not much more than a power allocation, and
the power margin must be high. As the design matures, the power requirements
become more refined, and the margins can be reduced. AIAA3 conducted a review
of historical data from prior NASA and U.S. Department of Defense programs to
establish the industrial guidelines for power margin; these are discussed in detail
in Chapter 2. These history-based data indicate that margins as high as 90% of
estimated power might be necessary for a new design spacecraft in the conceptual
stages; lower percentages are possible for mature designs with better definition.
Adequate power margin in the early design stages is particularly important
to the program because an increase in power requirement means an increase in

solar-panel size, and the solar panels are normally long lead items. Their size and
power output are set early in the program. If it later becomes necessary to increase
panel size, the schedule impact can be severe. A little to much panel is much better
for the program than a little too little.
At liftoff there should be a power margin of at least 10% in mission critical
modes to accommodate unforeseen changes in planned usage and resultant changes
in planned power profile.
6.1.7 Eclipse Period
The maximum eclipse period Tn is the design point for both the solar array and
the battery system. Figure 6.9 shows the eclipse period for a 425-km, circular,
polar, Earth orbit with a period of 93 min. The eclipse period over a semiannual
cycle varies from a maximum of 37 min to a minimum of 18 min.
In geosynchronous orbit there are long periods without an eclipse, as shown in
Fig. 6.10; however, during the eclipse season the eclipse period reaches a maximum
of 1.2 h.

for elliptical orbits of low eccentricity. If ftmax is in radians, modify Eq. (6.10) by
replacing 180 with n.
6.1.8 Solar-Panel Power Requirement
The solar-panel power requirement and the battery capacity requirement can be
determined from the energy balance for the spacecraft. As shown in Fig. 6.13, all
electrical energy consumed by the spacecraft, day or night, must be collected by
the solar panels during the daylight period of the orbit.

<<<PAGE 341>>>

POWER SYSTEM 329
The energy required from the solar panels consists of four parts: 1) energy
required for the daytime loads; 2) energy required to charge the battery for the
nighttime loads; 3) all of the energy losses involved in the system including
a) power losses of solar panel to the daytime loads, b) power losses of solar
panel to the battery, c) battery charging losses, d) power losses of battery to the
nighttime loads; and 4) all energy reserves, day and night.
6.1.8.1 Without losses. The solar-panel power requirement can be derived
from an energy balance for one orbit day-night cycle. The power consumed can
temporarily exceed the solar-panel output, but energy must balance. Without losses
the total system energy balance is the sum of the energy to charge the battery and
the energy to daytime loads:
EM = En + Ed (6.11)
where
Esa = required solar-array energy
En = energy consumed at night including reserves
Ed = energy consumed in daylight including reserves
The individual terms of the energy balance equation can be expressed as the
product of an average power and a time increment, or
(6.12)
where
Psa = average output power from the solar array over daylight period, W
Td = spacecraft daylight, the period in sunlight, h
Tn = spacecraft night, the period without solar energy, h
Pn = average power consumed by spacecraft loads during the spacecraft
night, W
Pd = average power consumed during the spacecraft loads during spacecraft
daylight, W
6. 1.8.2 With losses. The solar array must supply the energy for all losses
as well as the loads. It is convenient and relatively general to group the losses
into three fractions: Xa-i = power transfer efficiency, solar array to daytime
loads; Xa-b = power transfer efficiency, solar array to battery, including bat-
tery charging efficiency; X^_/ = power transfer efficiency, battery to nighttime
loads.
(Note that if the power loss = 10% the power transfer efficiency = 0.9.)
With losses Eq. (6.12) becomes

Psa is the minimum required power from the solar array at the end of life, and Pd and
Pn are the maximum, time-averaged electrical loads from the power requirements
table (including margin). The sunlight and eclipse time durations (Td and Tn)

Section 2.5). Maximum nighttime period is used for computation of the solar-
array power requirement.

Equations (6.14-6.16) are not general; the constituents of Xa-i, Xa_b, and Xb-i
depend entirely on the detailed schematic of the system under study and will vary
widely.
6.1.9 Battery Requirements
The traditional definition of battery capacity is the current that can be supplied
by the battery multiplied by the time from fully charged to depletion in ampere-
hours. Battery ampere-hour capacity and energy capacity are proportional. It is
convenient to define battery energy capacity from the energy balance and convert
energy capacity to ampere-hours. The battery energy capacity is the average night-
time power multiplied by the maximum eclipse time divided by the transmission
efficiency battery to loads

Xb-i = power transmission efficiency from battery to nighttime loads
Eb = energy supplied by the battery in a single nighttime cycle, measured at
the battery terminals
For the direct energy transfer system shown in Fig. 6.14, Xb-i is the product of
battery diode loss, 77 db times the line loss battery to loads 774, and
Eb = ^± (6.18)
6.1.9.1 Depth of discharge. Note that Eb, as just defined, is the energy
supplied by the battery in a normal day-night cycle. It is not the total energy
capacity of the battery because the battery is never allowed to discharge completely.
The percentage of energy removed from the battery in a discharge cycle is called
the depth of discharge (DOD). By definition DOD is
DOD = -^- (6.19)
where ZiBcap is the total energy capacity of the battery or battery system, W-h.
Note that depth of discharge is normally discussed in percentage but must be
used in equations as a fraction.
6. 1.9.2 Cycle life. Depth of discharge and temperature determine the cycle
life of a battery. Cycle life characteristics are peculiar to the cell type and are
discussed in Section 6.4 for NiH2 and NiCd batteries. Conversely, the required
cycle life of a battery determines the maximum allowable DOD.
6. 1.9.3 Battery capacity requirement. From Eqs. (6.17) and (6.19) the
minimum energy capacity requirement for a battery system is

Battery charging is specified in terms of charging rate
c, = 1 (6.23)
where CR is the charging rate and Tc the time of charging, h. A charging rate of
C/15 means a charge of one-fifteenth of full capacity in 1 h. Charging efficiency
varies as a function of charge rate and temperature; low charging rates produce
low losses.
Battery requirements and design are described in more detail in Section 6.4.
6.2 Solar Arrays
Solar arrays are the power source of choice for the vast majority of spacecraft.
A solar array consists of solar cells interconnected in strings, a diode set, and
a substrate. A spin-stabilized spacecraft usually has body-mounted solar arrays.
A three-axis-stabilized spacecraft normally has deployed and articulated panels.
Table 6.5 shows the performance of some flight solar arrays.
The weights in Table 6.5 include the substrate; articulating mechanism weights
are not included. The present level of solar-cell efficiency is about 15% at air
mass zero, and for an axis-stabilized vehicle a specific mass of about 100 W/m2
can be achieved. After accounting for all losses and degradation, an articulated

panel can deliver a specific power of about 100 W/m2. Body-mounted solar-cell
systems have specific mass and power considerably less than articulated panels, as
would be expected. Three-axis spacecraft deliver higher performance because the
panels are articulated and sun pointed. However, articulated panels are not free;
they require 1) an additional attitude control function, 2) sun sensors to position
the panels, 3) deployment and rotation mechanisms, and 4) a means of transferring
power through the mechanism, either slip rings or cable wrap with attendant failure
modes. The high specific power of Deep Space 1 panels is because of an advanced
Fresnel lens concentrator design.
A solar array has three primary constituents: 1) solar cells connected electrically
in a series parallel arrangement, 2) a substrate, which is the structural foundation for
the array, and can be ridged or flexible, ridged substrate being the most common;
and 3) a deployment mechanism. These parts will be discussed in subsequent
sections.
6.2.1 Solar Cells
Solar cells convert the incident solar energy into electrical energy. There are
two types of cells with a flight history: 1) silicon cells, which have by far the most
flight history, and 2) gallium arsenide cells, which are a more recent development.
A solar cell is a sandwich of n-type (electron rich) and p-type (electron poor)
semiconductors. For silicon cells phosphorous-doped silicon forms the n layer
and boron-doped silicon forms the p layer. When photons are absorbed in the
vicinity of the p-n junction, electron-hole pairs are formed, and an electromotive
force is established across the junction (see Fig. 6.15). Current will flow through
an external circuit connected across the junction. Bell Telephone Laboratories was
the first to demonstrate this conversion in 1954. There are two ways to make a
solar cell: one is with a thin layer of rc-type silicon on a layer of p-type silicon; the
other method is just the reverse with p-on-n. Both types were made in the early

experiments by Bell Laboratories. Because p-on-n gave slightly higher output,
all of our early spacecraft used p-on-n. In 1960 it was found that n-on-p gave
substantially better radiation resistance. All U.S. spacecraft since 1960 have used
n-on-p', Russian spacecraft have used n-on-p since the beginning.
Silicon solar cells are sliced from a crucible-grown, j9-type, silicon crystal. The
crystals are cut into slices about 0.5 cm thick. (From a cell performance view-point
they need be only ~0.002 cm thick.5) They are then cut into cells: common sizes
are 2x2 cm, 2x4 cm, and 2x6 cm; earlier cells were 1x2 cm. The n-type
impurity is infused into the cell at high temperature, forming a junction less than
1 /xm thick. The impurity is removed from all surfaces except the top or light
sensitive surface. Contacts are applied to the n and p surfaces. Normally the front
surface has grid lines to reduce shadowing, and the back surface has full contact.
An antireflective coating is placed on the light sensitive area. The back surface
may be coated to enhance power and reduce temperature. A cover slide, usually
fused silica, is placed over the solar cell; the cover slide serves several purposes:
1 ) The upper surface is systematically roughened and coated to reduce energy
loss caused by reflection. (The antireflective coating gives solar arrays their char-
acteristic blue color.)
2) The lower surface is coated to reflect UV, which is not converted to electrical
energy by the solar cell. In addition, UV degrades the adhesives and coatings in
the cell.
3) It protects the cell from radiation damage.
4) It protects the cell from physical damage and dust.
6.2.1.1 I-V curve. The voltage-current characteristics of an illuminated
solar cell are shown in Fig. 6.16. The I-V curve expresses the fact that, at a given

drops slowly until the peak power point is reached. As voltage is further increased,
current drops dramatically to zero at the open-circuit voltage. The power delivered
by the cell is the product I*V. The maximum power output of a cell is the maxi-
mum I*V product. It is also the largest rectangle that can be placed under the I-V
curve as shown in Fig. 6.16.
For a typical GaAs solar cell the peak power point is about 25 mW/cm2 at
0.9 V. The open-circuit voltage is about 1 V, and the short-circuit current is about
0.30 mA/cm2. For a typical silicon cell the peak power point is about 20 mW/cm2
at 0.5 V.
6.2.1.2 Shaded cells. Cells that are not illuminated become open circuits;
therefore, if a shadow falls across a string the entire string stops generating power.
Blocking diodes are placed between parallel strings to prevent current from circu-
lating uselessly through shaded cells. Preventing shadowing of the solar array is a
constraint on the general arrangement of the spacecraft. For spinning spacecraft,
strings must be arranged to pass into shadow as a unit.
Cell efficiency is defined as the peak power output of the cell divided by the
incident solar power, at a given set of conditions

The direct solar flux incident on a spacecraft in low Earth orbit is 1371 ± 5 W/m2 on
a surface normal to the sun. (This value was recommended for spacecraft design by
NASA in Ref. 6.) The incident power is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance from the sun; therefore, the solar flux near Earth varies from about 1310
to 1399 W/m2 as the Earth moves in an elliptical orbit around the sun. Table 6.6
shows the incident solar power available at the planets (mean planetary radius).
Table 6.6 shows why solar panels are not practical for use near the outer planets
beyond Mars. A 100% efficient 2x2 cell would generate 548 mW normal to the

sun, near Earth. The early Bell Telephone Laboratories cells were 5% efficient.
By 1972 multiple improvements in cell construction had raised cell efficiency to
10%, and modern black silicon cells had reached 15.5%2 or 82 mW per 2x2 cell.
Gallium arsenide cells have reached 18% efficiency. Efficiencies are normally
measured under air mass zero (AMO) sunlight at 25°C.
The power output of solar cells is at its peak when the solar radiation is normal
to the cell (incidence angle = 0). At incidence angles other than 0 deg, the power
is reduced proportionally to the cosine except at low angles where the increase in
reflection causes power loss greater than the cosine would indicate. Solar-panel
pointing need not be better than ±5 deg; at 5 deg the loss is less than 0.5%.
6.2.2 Temperature Effect
The approximately 85% of the solar energy that is not converted to electrical
power is either reflected or converted into heat. The heat in turn is reradiated into
space; the net effect is to raise the solar-panel temperature. The power output and
voltage of solar cells drop with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 6.17.
Peak power and efficiency of solar cells are measured at a standard temperature,
usually 25°C. The power loss is a linear function of temperature for silicon cells
and is approximately 0.5%/°C; thus,
P2 = Pl[l- 0.005(r2 - Ti)] (6.25)
where PI and P2 are the power levels for a cell (or a solar array) at T\ and T2,
respectively.
Solar cells are designed to reflect solar energy in the frequencies that do
not convert to power, and the solar array must be designed to reject as much
heat as possible. Body-mounted cells on a spinning spacecraft operate at much
lower temperatures than articulated solar panels on three-axis spacecraft. The
Magellan solar panels, which were designed to withstand the solar intensity at
Venus, used optical solar reflectors (OSRs are small thin mirrors) to reject heat.
The entire back surface of the panel was covered with OSRs as was 35% of the
front surface.
Gallium arsenide cells perform better than silicon cells at high temperature, as
shown in Fig. 6.18.

The most severe temperature environment for a solar array is the temperature
cycle as a spacecraft flies through a planet's shadow. Figure 6.19 shows the tem-
perature cycling of the Magellan solar panel as it passes through the shadow of
Venus; the orbit period is 3.2 h.
The design temperature limits for the Magellan panels were —120 to 115°C. The
electrical interconnects between the solar cells require particular design attention
to withstand this kind of cycling.

6.2.3 Radiation Degradation
Solar-cell power, short-circuit current, and open-circuit voltage are degraded by
radiation, as shown in Fig. 6.20.
The power system is designed such that the end-of-life (EOL) power is adequate
for the mission. Beginning-of-life (BOL) power is set by the estimate of radiation
damage over the life of the spacecraft.
Radiation damage to solar cells is caused by high-energy protons from solar
flares and from trapped electrons in the Van Alien belt. Figure 6.21 shows the
fluences of these two particles; the radiation has been normalized to equivalent
1 Mev fluence, electrons/cm2/year. The fluence is higher in orbits with 0-deg
inclinations and altitudes above 1000 km; electron radiation is dominant at altitudes
above 15,000 km. Proton radiation is negligible at geosynchronous altitudes.
Using the fluences from Fig. 6.21, Nagler4 calculated the power losses shown
in Table 6.7.
Agrawal5 lists power loss of approximately 25% for spacecraft in geosyn-
chronous orbit for seven years and 30% for 10 years. Figure 6.22 shows the effect
of radiation on the peak power for three types of solar cells.5
Radiation damage effects for planetary spacecraft in deep space are caused pri-
marily by the proton flux from solar flares. Table 6.8 shows the estimated degra-
dation of the Viking Orbiter solar panels over an 18-month cruise to Mars.8
The Magellan design power loss factors for a three-year Venus mission are
shown in Table 6.9.
Both spacecraft conducted successful multiyear missions at the respective
planets. Gallium arsenide solar cells have slightly different degradation results
as shown in Table 6.10.
The loss of power under radiation is caused in part by darkening of the cover
glass and adhesive; these losses amount to 4-10% during the first year and very
little thereafter.5 The cell damage rate decreases with time also, with damage in
the first two years about the same as that in the next five years. The degradation of
body-mounted arrays is slower than deployed arrays because body-mounted cells
are better shielded on the back side.

6.2.4 Solar-Array Design
Solar cells with a cover glass are interconnected electrically and bonded to
a structural substrate to form a solar array. Figure 6.23 shows a cross section
through a typical rigid solar array. An aluminum honeycomb substrate is shown in
Fig. 6.23. The cells are connected electrically, bottom to top, with an interconnect.
Even the lowly interconnect must be designed with care to take the expansion and
contraction of the wide temperature excursions a solar array is subjected to.
6.2.4.1 String design. Individual solar cells generate small power, voltage,
and current levels. A solar array uses cells connected in series to boost voltages to
desired levels, which are called strings. Strings are connected in parallel to produce

desired current levels (see Fig. 6.24). The series-parallel arrangement of cells and
strings is also designed to provide redundancy or string failure protection. The
strings for battery charging are sometimes segregated from the remainder of the
array and designed with a different series-parallel arrangement specifically tailored
for battery charging.
6.2.4.2 Minimum string voltage. The minimum voltage produced by a
string must be greater than the maximum voltage required on the power bus, which
is normally the battery charging voltage. The number of cells in series required to
produce a given voltage is
Number of cells = (Required string voltage)/(Minimum operational cell voltage)
A silicon cell produces about 0.5 V; therefore, it takes a 60-cell string to reach 30 V.
6.2.4.3 Minimum current. The desired minimum current levels are reached
by connecting strings in parallel:
Minimum current

6.2.4.4 Nominal bus voltage. Since Explorer I, spacecraft have used an
average bus voltage of 28 V dc. This selection was a direct descendant of aircraft
design practice that provided a wealth of equipment designed and qualified to
operate at this voltage. A few modern spacecraft are using higher voltages. The
considerations are as follows:
1) The higher the spacecraft power consumption, the higher the transmission
losses and the more attractive higher bus voltages are. For this reason, several mod-
ern communication spacecraft have gone to higher bus voltages; INTELSAT VIII,
for example, uses a 100-V bus with a 4.5-kW system. Communication spacecraft
also have the potential of multiple sales to help justify the expense of developing
and qualifying high-voltage equipment.
2) The larger the spacecraft the greater the cable losses and more attractive higher
voltages become. The Space Station uses a 120-V bus at power levels of 100 kW.
(In manned spacecraft astronaut safety considerations place an upper limit of about
120 V.)
These spacecraft are the exception; the vast majority of spacecraft still use a
28-V bus.

imum power for a cell under operational power points at BOL during design
minimum temperature conditions is shown in Fig. 6.25.

The minimum power condition, which is a design point for a solar array, occurs
at EOL during maximum temperature conditions. The minimum cell current and
voltage also occur at the minimum power point. For a planetary spacecraft the
change in solar intensity with distance must also be considered in establishing
maximum and minimum power points. For example, the minimum power point
for a Mars orbiter would occur at EOL, hot, at Mars. For a Venus orbiter like
Magellan, the maximum power point occurred at Venus under cold conditions
after the cruise degradation.
6.2.4.6 Area. Solar-array area is determined by the number of cells required
to meet the spacecraft power requirement at the minimum power point. Laboratory
data on solar-cell performance must be adjusted to EOL operational conditions,
and the solar flux expected. In addition, the cell density on the panel and power
losses in the array must be considered as follows:

For cylindrical spin-stabilized spacecraft with body-mounted cells Lp = l/n. For
sun-oriented flat arrays Lp = cos a, where a is the solar incidence angle. (Recall
that incidence is measured from the normal to the array.) Solar-cell power output
decays as the cosine of the incidence angle from a = 0 to about a = 45 deg. The
decay is worse than the cosine would indicate at angles greater than 45 deg, and
output goes to zero about 85 deg.
The product of mismatch loss r]m and interconnect loss 77 / is called the assembly
factor.
The effect of distance on solar intensity is an inverse square law, where R is
distance from the sun in millions of kilometers:
_ /149.6

The mean solar distance from the planets is shown in Table 6.11.
The effect of temperature is
77, = 1 - 0.005 (T - t)(6.27)
(6.28)
where T is the temperature of the cells in orbit, °C; and t is the temperature at
which cells were tested, usually 25-28°C.
The number of cells needed is
Nc = jl (6.29)
where Nc is the number of cells in the solar array and Psa the power produced by
the solar array, W.
The density of the cells installed in the array Dc can be estimated from the
packing factor, which is usually about 88%, and the area of the array is then
Asa = — (6.30)
where Asa is the area of the array, m2; and Dc is the installed density of the cells,
cells/m2.
6.2.4.7 Deployment. The Magellan solar-panel deployment method
(Fig. 6.26) is typical for three-axis-stabilized spacecraft. For launch the solar pan-
els were stowed folded downward and latched in position with explosive pins at
the midpoint. There were spring-loaded hinges located at the bus attachment point.

When the panel was released by the pin pullers, the springs raised the panels into
the flight position where they were locked in place.
6.2.4.8 Articulation. Normally the solar panels of three-axis-stabilized
spacecraft must be articulated in one or two axes to keep the panels normal to
the sun. The Magellan mission was designed such that one axis or rotation would
be adequate. The rotation mechanism (Fig. 6.26) had two components: 1) a rota-
tion mechanism, which was a motor bearing set, and 2) a cable wrap system for
power transfer.
6.2.4.9 Power transfer. As the solar panels rotate, in one axis or two, it is
necessary to transfer power from the rotating panels to the stationary bus. There
are two transfer methods in common use: 1) The first method is a cable wrap
mechanism, which wraps and unwraps a continuous cable with one end fixed
to the bus and one fixed to the panel. This method requires programmed panel
unwinds. (Magellan used cable wrap.) 2) The second method involves slip rings,
which transfer power from a rotating ring to a fixed brush. Slip rings were the cause
of the high-profile SEAS AT failure. As a direct result of the failure, NASA Ames
Research Center developed an innovative third method of power transfer using
inductive components. The inductive components form a magnetic slip ring that
functions like a power transformer, but makes use of a rotating coil to accommodate
rotation without contacts. A constant level of transfer power can be maintained
regardless of panel position.
6.2.4.10 Mass. The mass of a three-axis-stabilized solar array is about
4.0 kg/m2 including the substrate; 3.6 kg/m2 has been achieved (see Table 6.5). For
body mounted solar arrays on a spinning spacecraft 3.4 kg/m2 has been achieved
frequently. The Magellan substrate was a vented aluminum honeycomb core with

aluminum face sheets and a single central support beam running the length of the
panel. The mass of the support structure, which mounted the panel to the bus, was
15% of the supported mass. The mass of deployment hinge and the single-axis
rotation mechanism together was 13.8 kg/panel. There are other ways of doing de-
ployment and rotation; however, any three-axis vehicle must have some solution.
Example 6.1 Solar-Array Design
Design a solar array for a three-axis-stabilized, geosynchronous spacecraft,
which will deliver 1200 W at the end of a 10-year life. The solar-panel point-
ing system controls to within ±5 deg. The design temperature range of the panels
is —120 to +115°C. The chosen 2x4 silicon cell will deliver a minimum of
14.9% efficiency at 28°C and a solar flux of 1370 W/m2 normal to the cell.
In the laboratory the power output of a minimum cell is
PL = (0.137)(0. 149)(8) = 0.163 W/cell
After Agrawal7 the power loss caused by radiation after 10 years in a geosyn-
chronous orbit is about 30%, and the loss caused by UV discoloration is about 2%;
therefore, r)raa — 0.70, and rjuv = 0.98. Assume that the general arrangement is
designed such that shadowing is zero and rjs = 1 . No adjustment of the solar flux
is required because the orbit is near Earth. The adjustment for panel temperature
is
rjt = 1 - 0.005(115 - 28) = 0.565
Assuming maximum pointing error and using the generic values for the remainder
of the factors in Eq. (6.26) produces
Pc = (0.163)[(0.70)(0.98)(1.0)(0.99)(1.0)(0.975)(0.98)(0.99)(0.565)(0.996)]
= 0.0589 W/cell

6.2.5 Array Configurations

planar array, and 3) flexible array. Body-mounted arrays are used primarily with

is drum shaped with the cells mounted on the cylindrical surface parallel to the
spin axis (see Fig. 6.27).
The advantages of this configuration are 1) lightweight—the spacecraft struc-
ture serves as the substrate; 2) the cells are shielded from radiation on the back
side; 3) simplicity—no deployment or articulation mechanism is required. The
disadvantages are as follows: 1) Cells are rotated through sun and shadow; hence,
cell output is reduced by a factor of n. 2) The surface area of the array and power
are limited by the body size of the spacecraft. Hughes Aircraft Company has used
this configuration or several generations of spacecraft; in later generations they
gained area by the use of telescoping concentric cylinders. The specific power of
the body-mounted, spinning solar array of INTELSAT IV was 6.2 W/kg, EOL.
This compares to a specific power of 21.2 W/kg, EOL, for three-axis-stabilized
INTELSAT V.9 Both INTELSAT IV and V used the same solar cells; the specific
power gain is from pointing the solar panels.
Rigid planar arrays are the most common configuration for three-axis-stabilized
spacecraft. The advantages of this configuration are that 1) the array can be actively
pointed at the sun so that the area of the panel is used efficiently and 2) area is
not constrained, thus large power demands can be met. The disadvantages are
that 1) the panels must be stowed at launch and deployed after separation, 2) the
panels must be articulated, 3) power must be brought out of the panel through the
articulation mechanism, which requires a slip joint or a cable wrap. The Viking
Orbiter (Fig. 6.28) used four planar arrays, which were double folded for launch.
Once the panels were deployed on Viking Orbiter, the spacecraft was sun ori-
ented, and no further articulation of the panels was required.
Flexible arrays are a relative newcomer to spacecraft design, although the desir-
ability of a flexible, roll-up array was recognized very early. The major advantages
this design offers are 1) reduction of substrate weight and 2) flexible stowage.
The resulting array opens the door for very high-power arrays. Numerous con-
figurations are in the advanced stages of development; these are summarized in

Fig. 6.29. Table 6.12 shows the performance demonstrated with each of the solar-
array types.
The roll-out array used on the Hubble Telescope is shown in Fig. 6.30. The solar
arrays are two rectangular wings of retractable solar-cell blankets fixed between a
two stem frame. The blanket unfurls from a cassette in the middle of the wing. A
spreader bar at each end of the wing stretches out the blanket and maintains tension.
The wings are on arms that connect to a drive assembly on the telescope shell at
one end and to the cassette on the other end. The total length of the cassette, arm,
and drive is 4.8 m. Each wing has 10 panels, five on each half of the wing, that roll
out from the cassette. The small panels are made up of 2,438 solar cells attached
to a glass fiber/Kapton surface, with silver mesh wiring underneath that is covered
by another layer of Kapton. The blankets are less than 500 /xm thick so that they
can roll tightly when the wings are stowed. Each wing weighs 7.7 kg (17 Ib) and
at full extension is 12.2 m long and 2.5 m wide.

350 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
A primary deployment mechanism raises the solar-array mast to a position
perpendicular to the telescope. There are two mechanisms, one for each wing;
each mechanism has motors to raise the mast and supports to hold the mast in
place. Once the mast is raised, the secondary deployment mechanism unfurls the
wing blankets. The assembly rolls out the blanket, applies tension evenly so that
the blankets stretch, and transfers data and power along the wing assembly. The
solar-array drive rotates the panels to track the sun as the telescope moves in orbit.
Each blanket can roll out completely or part way. The mechanisms can be operated
manually by an astronaut if necessary.
The arrays were designed by the European Space Agency and built by British
Aerospace.
6.3 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators
Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) offer a spacecraft power source,
which is independent of the sun, and there are missions where this independence
is mandatory, for example, the Viking Lander, which operated on the surface of
Mars, or the Voyager, which visited the outer planets.
The development of RTGs was assigned to The Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), now ERDA, in 1955. They were developed under the Systems for Nuclear
Auxiliary Power (SNAP) program. The history of the SNAP RTGs is summarized
in Table 6.13. The odd-numbered devices, such as SNAP-3, used a radioisotope as
an energy source, and the even-numbered devices, such as SNAP-8, used a nuclear
reactor as an energy source. (Only one U.S. reactor device, the SNAP 10A, ever
flew,12 although the former USSR flew reactor power supplies on a routine basis.l)
The first RTG to fly was SNAP-3 in 1961. The early RTGs had a power density
of slightly better than 1 W/kg. SNAP-9A reached 2.0 W/kg, and Galileo reached
5.4 W/kg. All specific powers are for new isotopes.

RTGs convert the energy released during the decay of an isotope, usually Pu 238,
into electricity using the thermoelectric effect. In a typical RTG, shown in Fig. 6.31,
heat source blocks in the central core contain the isotope capsules, each encased
in an individual reentry heat shield. Each of the heat source blocks are in thermal
contact with the hot junction of thermoelectric units. Power is collected from the
thermoelectric units in a series-parallel arrangement and brought out of the unit
through a connector. The waste heat generated, about 90% of the energy, is radiated
to space by a set of fins.
The nominal, steady-state power, voltage, and current produced by one of the
Viking SNAP 19 units is shown in Fig. 6.32. The two operating modes of the RTG
were shorted and on load. In the shorted mode the RTG output voltage was less than
1 V, and the output current was about 22 A. While shorted, the degradation of the
thermoelectric units was minimized as a result of reduced hot junction temperature.
When the RTG was on load, the power control equipment maintained the voltage
at 4.4 ± 0.1 V dc. In this configuration the RTG could produce from 35 to 47 W
depending on fin root temperature and RTG age.
The main advantage of RTGs is independence from the sun. The disadvantages
of RTGs are as follows: 1) cost of the units, particularly the cost of the isotope;
2) cost of the labor involved in demonstrating compliance with safety requirements;
3) cost of safety provisions for ground crew; 4) power decreases with time because
of radiation damage to the units as well as nuclear decay; 5) neither the power output
nor the heat output can be turned off; and 6) emitted radiation is detrimental to
electronics and instruments; an extended boom is often required. In sum, RTGs
are not used when solar arrays will suffice.
6.4 Batteries
All spacecraft require batteries during eclipse periods, peak load periods, and
during launch operations. Table 6.14 compares battery types that have a successful
flight history.

Batteries are categorized as primary if they are used as the primary power supply
and are not rechargeable. Primary batteries are used by launch vehicles and were
used in the early short-lived spacecraft like Explorer, Pioneer, and Vanguard.
A secondary battery is used to store energy rather than as an energy source;
secondary batteries are rechargeable for many cycles. Nickel-cadmium, or NiCd
batteries, were the dominant spacecraft battery for decades; however, nickel-
hydrogen batteries, which first flew in 1976, are rapidly becoming the battery
of choice. Lithium batteries, with high power densities, are an emerging tech-
nology with several chemical combinations being developed. A Lithium-sulfur
dioxide battery flew on Galileo as the power supply of an experiment.
Fuel cells are a primary source of power for spacecraft requiring power in the
kilowatt range for periods up to a month. They are the power source of manned

spacecraft; they have flown on Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle. Energy is
supplied by the chemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen producing water as a
waste product. The hydrogen and oxygen are stored separately and fed to the fuel
cells at a controlled rate. The water is removed from the cells by capillary devices.
The Gemini system generated 320 W/kg and produced a kilowatt of power from a
pound of reactants.13
6.4.1 Nickel-Cadmium Batteries
The NiCd cell (Fig. 6.33) has four main components: 1) the negative plate made
of cadmium, which supplies electrons for the external loads when it is oxidized
during discharge; 2) the positive plates made of nickel, which accepts the electrons
returning from external loads; 3) the electrolyte, an aqueous potassium hydroxide
solution, which completes the circuit internally; and 4) a fibrous plastic fabric
separator, which holds the electrolyte in place and isolates the positive and negative
plates. The chemical reactions are reversible; hence, the cells can be cycled. The
units are hermetically sealed and must not be overcharged; overcharging releases
hydrogen gas.
NiCd cell voltage is about 1.1 V fully discharged and about 1.4V fully charged.
Cells are connected in series to get the desired voltage. The average discharge
voltage is about 1.25 V times the number of cells in the battery; for a typical
22 cell battery the average discharge voltage Vave is 27.5 V. Figure 6.34 shows the
electrical characteristics of a NiCd battery.
6.4.1.1 Cycle life. Depth of discharge and operating temperature are the
primary life-limiting factors for a cell. Batteries in a low Earth orbit are cycled
approximately 6000 cycles per year; as a result, the depth of discharge must be
low—20% is common. Geosynchronous spacecraft cycle the battery only about
100 cycles per year, and a depth of discharge of 50% is acceptable. Figure 6.35
shows cell cycle life as a function of depth of discharge for post 1970 NiCd cells
operating between 0 and 25°C.
6.4.1.2 Temperature. Batteries are the most temperature-sensitive compo-
nents of a spacecraft. Low temperatures reduce the recombination rate of oxygen
in the cell, which results in incomplete recharging and high cell pressure. At high

temperatures the life of the separator plastic is reduced. Typical NiCd battery
temperature limits are 5 to 20° C.
6.4.1.3 Battery charging. Charging efficiency varies as a function of
charge rate and temperature; low charging rates produce low losses. At normal
temperatures a charging rate of C/100 is about 50% efficient; for charging rates
in the range of C/10 to C/15, the charging process is about 80% efficient (see
Fig. 6.36).
Very high charging rates result in high battery temperatures. The normal range
of charging rates is C/15 to C/5, and several rates are usually provided. The three
charging rates for the 30 A-H Viking Orbiter battery are typical: C/40 (trickle
charge), C/15 (normal charge), and C/10 (maximum charge rate).
6.4.1.4 Charging efficiency. The energy used in charging a battery goes
to stored electrical energy and to heat. The percentage of total charging energy
that becomes electrical energy in the battery is the charging efficiency. Charging
efficiency is a strong function of battery temperature and charging rate (Fig. 6.36).
6.4.1.5 Dual-mode charging. For low Earth orbiters the time available
for recharge is too short for simple charging schemes. At maximum eclipse the
sunlight time is about 60 min, and eclipse is about 40 min. If a 33% DOD were
allowed, a constant charging rate of C/3 would be required to recharge the battery.
A dual charging mode is used to charge the battery in the time available. Just
emerging from eclipse the solar panels are cold, and the power output is at the
orbital maximum; the battery voltage is at an orbital minimum. During this period,

power limited charging is used; all of the excess power from the panels is used to
charge the batteries. The time spent in the high charge mode is limited by a battery
temperature-battery voltage relationship. When a preset battery temperature and
voltage are reached, the mode is changed to battery voltage limited charging,
which is done at a much lower rate (trickle charging). A number of selectable
battery temperature-voltage curves are provided, in the control electronics, for
battery charging. Typical control curves are shown in Fig. 6.37.

6.4.1.6 Reconditioning. Battery voltage gradually drops with cycling. Per-
formance can be essentially restored by reconditioning the battery. Reconditioning
consists of a very deep discharge followed by recharge at a high rate.
6.4.1.7 Battery mass. The specific energy of some NiCd battery systems
is shown in Table 6.15. The battery mass in Table 6.15 is the installed mass. The
average specific energy of these four systems is 24 W-h/kg.
Example 6.2 Battery System Design
Design a NiCd battery system to provide an average eclipse load of 567 W
(including margin) at 28 V for a duration of 38 min and a battery-to-load power
loss of 3%. The required cycle life is 10,000 cycles at 25°C. Use 20 A-h cells, and
provide battery-out capability.
From Fig. 6.35 the maximum DOD is 30%; from Eq. (6.21) the battery capacity
requirement is
567(38/60) _44Q7A.h
(0.97)(0.30)(28)
Using 20 A-h cells, three batteries would be required for normal operation, and
four would be required for battery-out capability. The energy capacity of the four
battery system is
Eb = (80)(28) = 2240 W-h
From Table 6.15, the specific energy of an installed NiCd battery is about
24 W-h/kg; therefore, the installed mass of the four battery system would be
about 2240/24 = 93.3 kg. Assuming 1.25 V per cell, 23 cells per battery would
be required for a 28-V bus.
The time in the sun, at maximum eclipse, for this orbit is 55 min; dual-mode
charging electronics would be required to charge the batteries in the 55 min
available.
Note that designing the battery system for maximum eclipse duration each orbit
is conservative because most eclipse periods are less than maximum (see Fig. 6.9).
In the preceding example it would be reasonable to argue that three batteries are
adequate because one battery out would result in a maximum DOD of 33% and
only a slight cycle life reduction in the case of a battery failure.

6.4.2 Nickel-Hydrogen Batteries
Nickel-cadmium batteries have been the spacecraft battery of choice for three
decades. They are in the process of being replaced by nickel-hydrogen batteries,
which offer improved cycle life and reduced mass. Table 6.16 shows the early
flight history of NiH2 batteries.
There are currently more than 50 spacecraft in orbit using NiH2 batteries.14 The
coming dominance of Ni-H batteries is even clearer looking downstream at soon-
to-be-launched designs. Nickel hydrogen batteries are replacing NiCd batteries
for all geosynchronous spacecraft15 and planetary spacecraft requiring power over
1000 W.
The nickel-hydrogen batteries use the most reliable electrodes from a fuel cell
and a NiCd battery. The nickel electrode in the battery is a conventional reversible
electrode as in the NiCd battery; however, the opposing hydrogen electrode is
similar to a fuel cell electrocatalytic diffusion electrode. The anodic active material
is hydrogen gas, and the gaseous reactions are catalyzed by the electrode. The

battery operates essentially as a sealed fuel cell. When the battery is charged,
nickel is oxidized in the conventional manner, and molecular hydrogen gas is
evolved at the hydrogen electrode. This hydrogen gas is contained in a cell pressure
vessel. When the cell is discharged, nickel is reduced at the nickel electrode, and
hydrogen gas is consumed at the hydrogen electrode. The cell construction, shown
in Fig. 6.38, consists of positive nickel electrodes and negative platinum electrodes
separated by asbestos mat. The electrode stack is surrounded by hydrogen gas
under pressure. The platinum electrode consumes hydrogen gas on discharge and
releases hydrogen on recharge. The hydrogen pressure in a cell is a direct linear
function of the state of charge and is used as a primary or backup measurement of
this parameter.
A typical multiple-cell NiH2 battery consists of a number of cells, connected in
series, to deliver the required voltage. Each cell is sized to deliver the ampere-hour
capacity required for the spacecraft loads. This process is identical to that used for
NiCd batteries.
Nickel-hydrogen batteries offer improved mass, cycle life, and reduced failure
modes compared to NiCd batteries. The performance of flight NiH2 battery systems
are shown in Tables 6.16 and 6.17.
Batteries designed for low Earth orbit (Table 6.18) are substantially different
from their GEO counterparts, particularly in the DOD used and specific energy
obtained.
Specific energy increases as capacity increases but tapers off above 50 Ah and
approaches an upper limit of about 63 Wh/kg for 8.89-cm-diam cells. Energy
density is primarily a function of cell pressure range. The cells in the 1980s, the
COMSAT design, and U.S. Air Force design cells had a pressure range of 500 to
580 psi. The cells in the 1990s have a pressure range of 800 to 850 psi with attendant
higher energy densities. Note that Tables 6.17 and 6.18 give specific energy for
complete IPV batteries. Specific energy is often given for the cells rather than the

6.4.2.1 Charging efficiency. The charging efficiency of NiH2 batteries is
shown as a function of temperature in Fig. 6.39. These values were calculated from

battery has a number of cells like those shown in Fig. 6.38; each cell has its own
pressure vessel. A CPV battery consists of a number of individual cells connected
electrically and contained in a single pressure vessel. The CPV design has several
advantages over conventional IPV designs, including a reduction in mass (~10%),

a reduction in footprint (~50%), and a reduction in volume (~30%). The size and
specific energy of CPV battery designs are given in Fig. 6.40
All of the early NiH2 batteries were IPV designs; Clementine was the first
spacecraft to fly a CPV battery in 1994, as shown in Table 6.16. All of the batteries
listed in Tables 6.17 and 6.18 use individual pressure vessels. The Mars Global
Surveyor, launched in 1996, and several soon-to-be-launched spacecraft are using
CPV technology.
6.4.2.3 Charge control. The most frequently used method of charging
NiH2 batteries in LEO applications is to charge at a high rate to a preselected
voltage-temperature limit and to trickle charge thereafter. The rate of heat dis-
sipation during charging increases markedly after 85% of capacity is reached.
To minimize dissipation losses in LEO applications, batteries are not normally
charged above 85% of capacity.
In GEO applications NiH2 batteries are normally coulometrically charged at
a fixed c/d ratio (c = ampere-hours returned on charge and d = ampere-hours
removed during discharge), returning 105-115% of the capacity removed on dis-
charge at a high rate of C/10 to C/25. The batteries are then switched to a low
trickle charge rate of C/60 to C/25 to bring the batteries to full charge.17
6.4.2.4 Efficiency. The best watt-hour efficiency achieved by current NiH2
batteries is 85% (similar to NiCd batteries).
6.4.2.5 Depth of discharge and cycle life. Batteries for spacecraft in
geosynchronous orbit require about 100 discharge cycles per year. Low Earth
and planetary orbits are much more demanding, requiring about 6000 cycles/year.

<<<PAGE 375>>>

POWER SYSTEM 363
Long cycle life in any battery can be achieved at the expense of depth of discharge.
(Recall that battery system mass increases in inverse proportion to DOD.) The
goal of NiH2 battery development is to reach 40,000 cycle life at a DOD of 35%,17
which is slightly better than current batteries.
The Hubble Space Telescope, the first major program to use NiH2 batteries in
LEO, is using them at the very conservative DOD of 10%. Significant test programs
are being conducted at Eagle Pitcher, COMSAT, Hughes, Lockheed Martin, NASA
Lewis Research Center, and elsewhere to determine the cycle life of NiH2 cells as
a function of DOD and temperature.
6.4.2.6 Temperature control. The recommended temperature range for
NiH2 batteries is —5 to 25°C during operation and 0 to 10°C during charging.17
6.4.2.7 Reconditioning. The INTELSAT V spacecraft has two 27-cell,
NiH2 batteries, which are reconditioned two weeks before each eclipse season.
The batteries are conditioned one at a time to keep one battery fully charged for
power in case of emergency. It takes about a week to recondition each battery. The
procedure for reconditioning is as follows17:
1) The battery is discharged through a 50-ohm resistor.
2) Individual cell voltages are scanned once per minute. Battery discharge is
terminated when the first cell in the battery reaches 0.5 V.
3) The battery is recharged at the high rate (C/21 to C/25) until 115% of the
amp-hour capacity removed has been returned (c/d = 1.15).
4) The battery is placed back on trickle charge until the beginning of the eclipse
season at the C/96 rate.
There is some evidence that NiH2 batteries do not have a memory and hence do
not need reconditioning.
6.5 Power Distribution and Control
Power control electronics performs three functions: 1) source control, which is
controlling the solar array; 2) storage control, which is controlling the battery; and
3) output control, which is controlling power served to the loads. Figure 6.41 shows
these power control functions superimposed on a direct energy transfer system.

6.5.1 Source Control: Controlling the Array Output
There are two common approaches to source control: 1) A peak power tracker
operates as a dc-dc converter in series with the solar array. It extracts the exact
power that the loads require, up to the peak power of the array, and transforms the
output voltage to the bus operating level. The PPT system makes efficient use of
the array, but it consumes about 5% of the array power.
2) In a direct energy transfer system the panel power output in not controlled.
Excess power generated by the panels is diverted to a shunt radiator, which converts
the power to heat in a resistor bank and radiartes the generated heat to space. The
shunt radiator and associated equipment is equipment is not needed in a PPT
system.
6.5.2 Output Control: Controlling Bus Voltage
Selecting the nominal bus voltage is basically a tradeoff between the availabil-
ity and flight history of 28-V equipment vs distribution power losses, as already
discussed. Controlling the variation of bus voltage is a job of the power control
electronics. A typical unregulated bus varies from 24 to 48 V. The lower volt-
age limit occurrs at the end of battery charging. The high voltage occurs when a
cold solar array emerges from shadow into full sun (see Fig. 6.17). Much space-
craft equipment can tolerate unregulated bus voltage swings; the thermal control
heaters for example. Some equipment cannot, notably the computers and science
instruments.
There are three major options for regulating bus voltage: First is the unregulated
bus, where sensitive equipment provides its own regulation with an unregulated
input voltage. The attractiveness of this option depends on how much sensitive
equipment there is. Second is partial regulation, where bus voltage is regulated
during solar-panel operation in sunlit periods; battery discharge voltage is not
regulated. Third is the fully regulated bus, where voltage from the solar panel and
the battery is controlled. In large systems a fully regulated bus may be a lighter
option than individual equipment regulation.
The power control system might also be required to deliver special power types
to some equipment, for example, dc to dc voltage conversion or dc to ac.
6.6 Estimating Subsystem Mass
The mass-estimating relationships for the power subsystem are summarized in
this section. The big mass items in the power subsystem are the batteries, solar
array, control electronics, and cabling, as shown by the Magellan power system
mass statement (Table 6.19). It is common practice to account for power and
cabling as separate items at the subsystem level.
The solar-panel substrate, mechanisms, and bus attachment, amounting to
95.1 kg, are normally budgeted as part of the spacecraft structure; however, these
masses are a direct function of solar-array size and must be considered in the power
system design choices. The solar-cell assembly includes the cells, interconnects,
adhesives, wiring, and diodes; in the Magellan case it also includes optical solar
reflectors, which are small thin mirrors used to reflect the sun and keep panel
temperature down. Thirty-five percent of the Magellan panel area was populated
with OSRs instead of solar cells. This unusual protection was made necessary by
the high solar intensity at Venus.

6.6.1 Solar Array
In comsat design it is traditional to use specific power to estimate solar-array
mass. This practice works well because the geosynchronous environment is well
defined. In considering a broader range of missions, it is better practice to calcu-
late the required solar-array area under the expected conditions and then compute
solar-array mass using a mass per unit area which describes your planned construc-
tion. This latter technique works for LEO, GEO, comsat, metsat, Earth observer,
planetary, any cell type, spinner, or three-axis spacecraft. Table 6.20 shows solar-
panel mass per unit area for various flight spacecraft.
The array mass in Table 6.20 includes cells, interconnects, panel wiring, and
substrate. For three-axis-stabilized spacecraft Table 6.20 shows that flight solar
panels weigh about 4.5 kg/m2. One spacecraft, INTELSAT V, achieved 3.6 kg/m2
with aluminum honeycomb substrate and graphite-epoxy face sheets. Laboratory
panels18 are achieving 3.5 kg/m2. For body-mounted solar-arrays on spinning
spacecraft, 3.4 kg/m2 has been achieved several times.
All of the three-axis spacecraft shown in Table 6.20 used rigid, folding pan-
els. Some flight experience is available with flexible roll-out arrays and flexible
fold-out arrays (FRUSA). Table 6.21 shows solar-panel specific mass, which can
be expected for future designs of each array type.

cells, is often quoted. The mass of an IPV battery is about 1.25 times the sum of
the cell masses and about 1.13 times CPV cell mass.
6.6.3 Control Equipment
The mass of the power control and distribution equipment as a function of EOL
solar-panel power output is shown in Fig. 6.42. These three programs indicate
that the mass of power control and distribution equipment can be estimated as
0.07 kg/W of EOL power from the solar panels.
6.6.4 Cabling
Cable weights are difficult to estimate in the early phases of a program because
of sensitivity to detailed spacecraft geometry and equipment arrangement. Cabling
mass is not accurately known until the first cable mock up is made in the fabri-
cation phase; large mass fluctuations are painful at that time. Work is going on
investigating computer models for accurate early cable mass predictions, but these
are not currently available. In early phases cable weight can best be estimated as
a percentage of on-orbit dry weight. Twenty flight spacecraft programs were ana-
lyzed, and cable mass as a percentage of on-orbit dry mass showed the best fit and
least scatter. Table 6.23 shows these results.
The percentages shown in Table 6.23 are the ratio of cable mass to on-orbit
dry mass expressed as a percentage. Comsats are shown separately because all
six spacecraft studied showed a lower cable mass percentage. The highest cable
mass percentage and lowest percentage in each group are also shown. The comsats
studied were INTELSATS IV, V, and VI. The other spacecraft category included

for a 20-min period while the spacecraft is in the sun. During this period, there is
no power generated by the solar array. The spacecraft is in the sun a total of 60 min
per orbit, including the 20-min period with the panel in the stowed condition, and
is in the shade 30 min per orbit. The power used by the spacecraft while the solar
arrays are operating is 300 W, and the power used while solar the solar panels are
not operating is 150 W. The daytime transmission efficiency is 65%, the nighttime

Thermal Control
Robert K. McMordie*
The purpose of a spacecraft thermal control subsystem is to maintain all of the
elements of a spacecraft system within their temperature limits for all mission
phases. To provide a design that meets the temperature requirements of the space-
craft, the designer must account for heat inputs from many different sources. These
heat sources include the sun, the Earth, and heat dissipation from electrical and
electronic components onboard the spacecraft. In most instances the heat inputs are
highly variable with time. For example, the magnitude of direct solar heating on a
spacecraft surface can vary from 1371 W/m2 (when the surface normal is parallel
to the solar vector) to zero (when the spacecraft is in the shadow of the Earth). Also,
the geometry of a spacecraft is generally very complex. These characteristics cause
the thermal analyses that define the thermal behavior of spacecraft to be extremely
complicated, involving transient solutions for problems with complex geometry.
This leads to numerical solutions using specialized computer programs. There-
fore, on a typical spacecraft project, the computer usage by the thermal control
group will be relatively high. However, the thermal control subsystem accounts
for only about 2-5% of the total spacecraft cost and about the same percentage of
the weight.
Engineers assigned to spacecraft thermal control groups typically will have a
degree in aerospace, mechanical, or chemical engineering. The major engineering
discipline used in spacecraft thermal control is heat transfer; however, thermo-
dynamics, applied mathematics, computer science, testing, material science, and
instrumentation are also important.
Requirements for a spacecraft thermal control system are generally provided at
several levels. Top-level system requirements define temperature margins, overall
testing requirements, and environmental definitions (shown in Fig. 7.1), such as the
direct solar, Earth-reflected solar (albedo), and Earth-emitted energy flux levels.
The spacecraft design personnel develop derived requirements, for example, sub-
system weight allocations and cost goals. Finally, temperature limits are defined
by the various subsystem groups for their components based on supplier data.
Typical temperature ranges for spacecraft components are given in Table 7.1.
Silicon solar cells can generally operate over a wide range; however, it is desirable
to operate as low as possible in the range because the lower the operating tem-
perature is the higher the solar cell efficiency. Normally, structures exhibit wide
temperature limits. The exception is for a situation involving structures that support
equipment, such as cameras, which have extremely accurate pointing requirements.

In this situation the structural elements might have a temperature variation require-
ment of ±0.5°C or less in order to minimize differential thermal expansion, which
distorts the spacecraft shape and adversely affects pointing. The plastics shown
are used for making multilayer insulation blankets. Note that the values given for
nylon are an estimate. The temperature limits for hydrazine, a common monopro-
pellant, are dictated by freezing on the low end and decomposition on the high
end. Because of this, the typical thermal design for hydrazine lines is to cold bias
the lines and use thermostatically controlled heaters to maintain the lines above
the lower limit. Cold bias means to design a given region of the spacecraft so
that it operates below the upper temperature limit for all equipment in the region.
When this is done, usually some of the equipment in the region will operate below
their lower temperature limit if nothing is done to prevent this. Therefore, thermo-
statically controlled heaters, which keep the equipment temperatures above their
lower limits, are provided.
7.1 Relationship to Other Subsystems
A spacecraft thermal control subsystem affects and is affected by almost all other
spacecraft subsystems. The power subsystem typically has the greatest interaction
with the thermal control subsystem. This results from the necessity of accounting
for all dissipated electrical energy and transferring this energy to a radiator for
rejection to space. Also, batteries generally have a narrow temperature operat-
ing range and often require special attention from the thermal control engineers. If
infrared (IR) sensors are part of the spacecraft payload, they can be a major problem

for the thermal control subsystem. Sensors of this type are often required to oper-
ate at temperatures in the cryogenic range, 0-120°K, which demands, generally,
a low-temperature mechanical refrigeration system and special low-temperature
radiators. If the mission is of short duration, it is sometimes practical to use a
stored, expendable cryogen (liquid helium, for example) for a low-temperature
heat sink. Finally, spacecraft attitude control can have a significant influence on
the thermal control subsystem design. The attitude of the spacecraft determines
the thermal radiation inputs from the sun and Earth. The radiation inputs affect
radiator performance and spacecraft temperatures.
7.2 General Approaches and Options
7.2.1 Subsystem Classification
Spacecraft thermal control subsystems are classified as active, passive, or semi-
passive. There are no universally accepted definitions for these three classifications;
however, most spacecraft engineers consider pumped-loop systems, heaters con-
trolled by thermostats, and mechanical refrigerators to be active systems. Space
radiators thermally coupled to heat sources by conductive paths are generally con-
sidered passive subsystems. Systems that use louvers, variable conductance heat
pipes, or thermal switches (discussed later) are often referred to as semipassive;
however, these will be defined as passive systems for this discussion.
7.2.2 Active and Passive Subsystems
The first decision facing the thermal control engineer with respect to a spacecraft
design is whether the subsystem should be active or passive. This is generally an
easy decision as about 95% of the time unmanned spacecraft can by controlled
passively and a passive design is generally lighter, requires less electrical power,
and is less costly than an active design. Active thermal control subsystems are used
for manned spacecraft, for situations requiring very close tolerance temperature
control (a few degrees), or for components that dissipate large amounts of waste
energy, on the order of several kilowatts. Examples of active and passive thermal
control systems are shown in Fig. 7.2.
The cold plates shown in Fig. 7.2 are devices used for mounting heat dissipating
equipment. The cold plate for the active subsystem is configured with fluid passages
integral with the plate. For the active subsystem, thermal energy is dissipated as
waste heat in the electrical equipment. This heat is transferred across the bolted
interface to the cold plate. The fluid, which is circulated through the cold plate,
then transports the waste heat to a radiator where it is rejected to space. The passive
subsystem shown in Fig. 7.2 combines the cold plate with the radiator. Also, for the
arrangement shown a phase change device has been added. This thermal control
device absorbs thermal energy through a solid/liquid phase change and is used
when electrical equipment has high, short bursts of power. By incorporating a phase
change device for this situation, the phase change material, usually a paraffin, will
reduce temperature spikes in proportion to the amount of paraffin used. During
the period of heat dissipation, the paraffin melts and absorbs the waste heat. While
the equipment is inactive, the phase-change material cools and solidifies. Detailed
information concerning phase-change devices is given in Ref. 2.

7.2.3 Thermal Control Devices
7.2.3.1 Heat pipes. Heat pipes, illustrated in Fig. 7.3, have been flown on
numerous spacecraft. These lightweight devices are used to transfer heat from one
location to another. For example, a heat pipe might be used to transfer the heat
dissipated in an electrical component to a space radiator. The construction of a
heat pipe is generally a hermetically sealed tube with a wicking device on the
inside surface of the tube. The wicking device might be grooves, as shown in the
figure, or a mesh made of fabric or metal. A fluid is enclosed in the tube and fills
the open center of the heat pipe with its gas phase and the wick with its liquid

phase. Heat applied at one end of the pipe will cause evaporation of the liquid in
the wick. The gases formed by the evaporation flow down the center of the heat
pipe to the opposite end. At this location heat is transferred from the pipe causing
condensation to take place in the wicking material. Capillary forces draw the fluid
from the condenser end to the evaporator end of the heat pipe, thus completing
a heat-transfer loop. This loop occurs naturally when one end of the heat pipe is
maintained at a higher temperature than the other. Because of the relatively high
latent heat of evaporation of the heat pipe's working fluid, these devices exhibit
high heat-transfer rates with small temperature differences from the evaporator to
the condenser end of the heat pipe. Heat pipes can transfer 200-300 times as much
energy as a solid copper bar of the same size!
The heat pipe shown in Fig. 7.3 is a fixed conductance pipe. Heat pipes can
also be designed to exhibit variable conductance characteristics and, therefore, the
ability to automatically modulate heat transfer. Heat pipes that are designed to
operate at room temperature generally are made of aluminum with ammonia as
the working fluid. The material selection is critical because some combinations of
working fluids and pipe materials will cause a slow chemical reaction, which results
in the generation of noncondensable gases. These gases collect in the condenser
end of the pipe and prevent the normal condensation from taking place. This
can severely affect the performance of the pipe. The typical performance of a
1.27-cm-diam heat pipe is about 5080 W-cm. This means that the heat pipe will
transfer 508 W over a 10-cm distance. One disadvantage of heat pipes is that their
performance in a l-g environment is affected by the orientation of the axis of the
pipe relative to the gravity vector. This means that for testing on Earth the axis of
the pipe must be accurately positioned so that it is essentially horizontal. If this is
done, the heat pipe's thermal performance in space and on the Earth will be about
the same. However, for some heat pipe designs being off horizontal by a degree
or less will change their performance significantly, relative to their performance
in space.
7.2.3.2 Louvers. Louvers, shown in Fig. 7.2, act similar to Venetian blinds
and are positioned between a radiator surface and deep space. The rate of heat flow
to space is modulated by the opening or closing of the louver blades. Bimetallic
springs are typically used to actuate the louver blades. The springs are thermally
coupled to the space radiator and react to the radiator temperature. At a temper-
ature of 304°K with the blades wide open, the heat rejection rate will be about
430 W/m2. Closed and at a temperature of 283°K, the rejection rate is on the order
of 54 W/m2. One problem encountered with louvers is the high temperature that
results if the louvers are inadvertently pointed at the sun. Some spacecraft designs
have included covers over the louvers to avoid this potential problem; however, a
cover significantly decreases the thermal performance of the louvers.
7.2.3.3 Thermal switches. These devices are placed in thermal conduc-
tion paths with contacts that open and close in response to a temperature sensor.
Opening the contacts breaks the conduction path; closing completes the path. A
thermal switch was used on the Viking spacecraft. The switch contacts, which
when closed, provided a direct conduction path between the equipment mounting

378 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
plate (cold plate) and the heat source, a radioactive thermal generator. The actua-
tor that controlled the movement of the contacts was driven by a gas charge that
expanded and contracted in response to the temperature of the equipment mount-
ing plate. A special feature of the device was the contacts design. Before Viking,
thermal switches had been employed on spacecraft and had failed. The failure
mode resulted from foreign particles in the contacts, which prevented the contacts
from seating securely and, therefore, restricted the flow of heat at the contacts. The
Viking design avoided this potential problem by being fitted with "soft" contacts.
The design of the contacts included aluminum blocks coated with silicone grease
and covered with a tinfoil.
This design allowed particles on the order of 0.025-cm diam and 0.6 cm long
to be present on the contacts interface with no appreciable effect on the thermal
switch's performance.
7.2.3.4 Thermal control coatings. These are surfaces that have special
radiation properties that provide the desired thermal performance for the surface.
Examples are paints, high-quality mirrors, and silverized plastics.
7.2.3.5 Thermal Insulation. The primary insulation used on spacecraft is
multilayer insulation. A typical arrangement is alternate layers of aluminized Mylar
and a course net material. The net acts as a separator for the Mylar layers. Kapton,
a plastic which is much stronger and has a higher service temperature that Mylar, is
often used for the outer and inner layers of a multiplayer blanket. In some instances
all of the layers of the blanket are made of Kapton.
7.2.3.6 Electrical heaters and thermostats. These active devices are
generally used to thermally control regions that are cold biased (designed to run
cold). The heaters, turned on and off by thermostats, heat a normally cold region
and control the temperature within the required limits. This approach is typically
used when fine temperature control is required.
7.2.3.7 Pumped loop systems. Pumped loop systems use a fluid that col-
lects waste heat from equipment at a cold plate. The cold plate contains fluid
passages, and the heat dissipating equipment is bolted to the cold plate. The fluid
transports the waste heat to a space radiator, where it is rejected to space.
7.3 General Design Methodology
The fundamental responsibility of the thermal control engineer on a space-
craft project is to ensure that all elements of the spacecraft remain within their
temperature limits during all mission phases. To accomplish this, first the temper-
ature limits of all spacecraft components must be cataloged by the thermal control
group with inputs from almost all other spacecraft engineering groups. Next, the
thermal control engineer must establish the thermal boundary conditions for the
mission. This is accomplished by determining from the mission analysis group
the spacecraft attitude and orientation (relative to the Earth and the sun) for all

mission phases. Also, from the power group the electrical power dissipation in all
electrical components must be defined.
Once thermal boundary conditions are established, temperature limits defined,
and other requirements understood, actual thermal design can be accomplished.
The overall design process is illustrated in Fig. 7.4. Analytical tools used in the
thermal design are typically two generalized computer programs. The first is a
radiation program that defines the absorbed energy on the spacecraft external sur-
faces. This absorbed energy can come directly from the sun, solar energy reflected
from the Earth (albedo), or IR energy emitted from the Earth. This same radiation
program is also used to define all of the spacecraft surface radiation exchange
factors and view factors. These factors define the radiation interaction between the
spacecraft surfaces. After the radiation aspects of the overall problem are estab-
lished, a heat-transfer model of the spacecraft is assembled. A generalized thermal
analyzer is used for this model. This program can be run steady state or transient
and accounts for conduction, radiation, convection, internal heat generation, and
fluid flow. With this spacecraft thermal model one can inspect component tem-
peratures during the mission and adjust the thermal control hardware elements of
the spacecraft until all temperature limits are satisfied. Spacecraft thermal design
must keep the temperature limits for a component "inside" the flight acceptance
temperature limits of the component. For example, if a component must pass flight
acceptance tests at low- and high-temperature levels of 5 and 50°C, with a thermal
margin of 5°C, the spacecraft thermal control engineer must maintain the given
component at 10 to 45°C, 5°C inside the flight acceptance limits. Thermal margins
are analogous to safety factors used in structural design and are generally in the
range of 5 to 10°C.
System-level thermal tests are generally required as a necessary part of a space-
craft program, and these tests fall into two major categories. The first of these is a
solar balance test, and the other is a thermal vacuum test. Both of these type tests
are conducted in a vacuum chamber equipped with nitrogen-cooled walls to ther-
mally simulate deep space. The balance tests are performed usually with a solar

simulator and often electric heaters or IR lamps to simulate Earth IR radiation.
Solar simulation is accomplished using a light source (often filtered), which sim-
ulates the solar spectrum and the solar flux level expected during the mission. The
purposes of balance tests are to establish experimentally the worst-case hot and
worst-case cold thermal performance of the spacecraft and to validate the analyt-
ical thermal model of the spacecraft. If there are significant differences between
the test results and the mathematical predictions, studies are performed to identify
the reason(s) for the differences. Experience has shown that the differences can
be the fault of either inaccuracies in the model or problems with the test. After
close correspondence is achieved between analysis and test, the thermal model can
be used with confidence in predicting the temperatures of the spacecraft for any
flight situation.
Thermal vacuum tests are typically performed using electric heaters or IR lamps,
with these heating sources controlled to force spacecraft temperatures to prescribed
levels. Thermal vacuum tests are used to verify the workmanship of the spacecraft
and provide a means of checking the operation of the spacecraft components in a
simulated space environment.
7.4 Basic Analytical Equations and Relations
7.4.1 Introduction
Heat transfer is divided into three major areas: conduction, convection, and
radiation. Conduction is associated with thermal energy transfer through matter in
the absence of fluid motion. Convection is concerned with thermal energy transfer
between a flowing fluid and a solid interface. Radiation is energy transfer via
electromagnetic waves. Convection generally plays a minor role in low-Earth orbit
or unmanned spacecraft; therefore, this heat-transfer mode will not be discussed.
Heat-transfer references are given at the end of this chapter; see Refs. 3 and 9.
7.4.2 Conduction
The fundamental equation for steady-state heat conduction in rectangular coor-
dinates and one dimension is
Q = (——j(T\ - T2) (7.1)
In Eq. (7.1) Q represents the energy transfer rate in watts, T the temperature in
degrees Kelvin, k the thermal conductivity in W/(m-K), Ax the length of the heat-
transfer path in meters, and A the area normal to the heat-transfer direction in
square meters.
Figure 7.5 illustrates steady-state conduction for rectangular, cylindrical, and
spherical coordinate systems. The relations shown in Fig. 7.5 are used in the
development of thermal networks, which will be discussed later in this chapter.
7.4.3 Radiation
7.4.3.1 Radiation fundamentals. All matter radiates electromagnetic en-
ergy in the form of "small bundles of energy" called photons. Photons travel at the
speed of light and have zero mass. The photons are emitted from the surfaces of

all matter, and the general equation representing the total energy per unit time per
unit surface area, g(W/m2) is given by
q = (7.2)
Equation (7.2) was first enunciated by Stefan who established the relationship
experimentally. Later Boltzmann developed the equation theoretically. The nu-
merical value of the constant a (known as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant)
defined by Stefan in 1879 is very close to the currently accepted value of 5.67 x
10~8 W/(m2K4). The remaining terms in Eq. (7.2) are the emissivity e, a dimen-
sionless number, and 7\ the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin.
Emissivity (or emittance) is a dimensionless thermophysical property that varies
between zero and one. A perfect emitter has an emissivity of one and is called a
blackbody. Certain black paints have emissivities very close to one. Polished gold
or silver surfaces have emissivities in the neighborhood of 0.05.
Surfaces not only emit photons, but they also absorb photons. In an enclosure
that is maintained at a uniform temperature, there is emission of radiant energy
from all surfaces according to Eq. (7.2). For the objects within the enclosure to
remain at a uniform temperature, which we know will indeed happen, there must
be an absorption of radiant energy (photons) to balance the emission. This is
the case, and it can be proven that at a given wavelength (radiation has a wave
characteristic as well as a particle characteristic) the emissivity is identically equal
to the absorptivity (Kirchoff's law). Absorptivity is defined as the percentage of
incident radiant energy that is absorbed by a surface.
Surface radiation properties, including absorptivity, are described in Fig. 7.6.
In this figure a transparent plate is irradiated by an incoming radiation source
G. The incoming radiation will be either reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. The

percentage of incoming radiation that is reflected is defined as the reflectivity, the
percentage absorbed is defined as absorptivity, and the percentage transmitted is
defined as transmissivity.
As already mentioned, radiation exhibits the characteristics of waves. It is nec-
essary to inspect thermal radiation from the standpoint of electromagnetic waves
to be able to understand the principals of spacecraft thermal control.
Let us focus again on the radiant energy emitted from a surface. The equation
that defines the monochromatic radiation energy (radiation energy at a given wave-
length) Ebx, emitted from the surface of a blackbody (emissivity = 1), is given by
Planck's equation:
(7.3)
(e* - 1)
In Eq. (7.3) Eb^ is the monochromatic emissive power (emissive power at a given
wavelength or energy per unit time per unit area per unit wave length), C\ and
€2 are constants, A, is the wavelength, and T is the absolute temperature. For a
nonblackbody the monochromatic emissivity (emissivity at a given wavelength)
£x must be included in Planck's equation. To determine the total emission from a
surface, Eq. (7.3), along with e^, must be integrated between 0 and oo, as shown
in Eq. (7.4):
(7.4)r^c= I —Jo e >-T — 1
If Sx is a constant, independent of wavelength, Eq. (7.4) reduces to Eq. (7.2), the
Stefan-Boltzmann equation.
Equation (7.3) was used to generate the curves shown in the upper part of
Fig. 7.7. These curves are plots of normalized emissive power (for a given temper-
ature) vs wavelength. The normalized emissive power is the ratio of the monochro-
matic emissive power to the maximum monochromatic emissive power for the
given temperature. The use of normalized emissive power allows the curves that
correspond to the solar temperature level and room temperature level (294° K) to
be shown on the same graph. The maximum value for the solar emissive power is
several orders of magnitude larger than the room- temperature maximum emissive
power, and therefore the room temperature curve would be hard to see on a normal
graph. The curve labeled "solar" is a normalized plot of Planck's equation using
a temperature consistent with the effective temperature of the Sun, about 5800°K.

The curve labeled "294 K" is the same type of plot representing the normalized
emissive power of a surface at a room temperature level. The important feature of
thermal radiation illustrated by this plot is that solar radiation is concentrated in
the short wavelengths, whereas room temperature emission is concentrated in the
long wavelengths.
The emissivity of white paint vs wavelength is shown in the plot at the bottom of
Fig. 7.7. The curve is also the absorptivity vs wavelength because monochromatic
emissivity is identically equal to monochromatic absorptivity. The white paint
properties £x and a\ will now be used along with the characteristics of the emissive
powers curves to show why a white painted surface exposed to solar radiation in
space will exhibit a relatively low temperature. To show this, it is necessary to
determine the absorbed solar radiation on a white surface and balance this heat
input with the radiation emitted from the surface. It is assumed that the back side
of the white surface (the side of the plate away from the solar input) is perfectly
insulated so that the absorbed solar energy and the emitted (infrared) energy are
the only quantities involved in the energy balance on the white surface. To estimate
the absorbed radiation by the white paint resulting from incoming solar radiation,
one replaces the emissivity in Eq. (7.4) with the absorptivity of the white paint and
uses an effective solar temperature:

384 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
The constant factor F in Eq. (7.5) reduces the flux level from the value at the
surface of the sun to the value at the Earth and is numerically equal to the ratio
of the square of the sun's radius to the square of the distance from the sun to
Earth. The results of the integration will yield a relatively low value because the
absorptivity in the solar wave band (0 to 3 //m) is low. The absorbed solar energy
must be balanced by the emission from the white painted surface.
The radiation emission is determined using Eq. (7.4). The expression for the
monochromatic emissivity is taken from the curve for white paint on Fig. 7.7, and
the temperature is varied until the results from the integration of Eq. (7.4) equals
the absorbed solar radiation on the surface from Eq. (7.5). Results show that the
temperature, which satisfies the energy balance, will be relatively low because the
monochromatic emissivity for white paint is relatively high over the long (infrared)
wavelengths. To summarize, the white paint absorbs weakly in the short solar wave
band, but emits strongly in the long infrared wave band. The result is that white
surfaces run relatively cool in sunlight.
7.4.3.2 Selective surfaces. Surfaces with radically different emissivity (or
absorptivity) values in the solar wave band as compared to the IR wave band are
called selective surfaces. The mean average value of the absorptivity, over the
solar wave band, is called solar absorptivity as, whereas the mean average value
of emissivity over the IR wave band is called IR emissivity SIR. IR emissivity is
a weak function of surface temperature, and generally the temperature must be a
few hundred degrees different from room temperature to show a significant change
from the room temperature value. Most spacecraft thermal analyses are performed
using the mean average values as and SIR and do not require use of the integral
equations just shown [Eqs. (7.4) and (7.5)].
The type of selective surface that will produce the lowest temperature when
irradiated by solar energy in space is an optical solar reflector. This type of surface
is shown in Fig. 7.8. An optical solar reflector is composed of a substrate with a
highly reflective surface overlaid with a transparent cover. Incoming radiation is
partially reflected off the outer surface of the transparent cover, partially absorbed
in the cover material, but primarily transmitted to the reflective surface. At the
reflective surface the majority of the transmitted radiation is reflected back to
space. Highly reflective surfaces are inherently metallic surfaces; however, metallic
surfaces inherently exhibit relatively low emissivities. Therefore, the reflective
surface will not contribute much to radiation emission. However, the outer surface

of the transparent material being a nonmetallic will generally have a high emissivity
and, therefore, is a major source of emission. Because the cover is extremely
thin, the temperatures of the cover and the substrate are essentially the same. The
overall effect is that the optical solar reflector will have a relatively high effective
emissivity, primarily a result of the transparent material, but a low solar absorptivity
resulting from the high reflectivity of the metallic surface. Representative values
for optical solar reflectors are an IR emissivity of 0.8 and a solar absorptivity of
0.15.
7.4.3.3 Surface temperature predictions. If a surface with an IR emis-
sivity of 0.8 and a solar absorptivity of 0.15 is perfectly insulated on the back
side, placed in space, and irradiated with solar energy normal to the surface, the

solar reflector, and a is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 5.67 x 10"8 W/(m2-K4).
The radiation surface properties as and SIR are mean average values. These quan-
tities are used routinely in radiation analysis; values of these properties are given
in Table 7.2.
7.4.3.4 Radiator temperatures. Equation (7.7) can be used to estimate
the temperature of insulated surfaces with solar heating. If the solar vector is not
normal to the surface, multiply the left side of Eq. (7.7) by cos 9. The angle 9 is
the angle between the surface normal and the solar vector. Equation (7.7) can also
be expanded to provide a means of estimating the performance of space radiators.
This is accomplished by adding the waste heat term (<2wM/?) to the left side of
Eq. (7.7). Qw is the waste heat rejected by the radiator in watts, and Aw is the
radiator area in square meters. The resulting equation is
Gs<xscose + —— = crsiRr4 (7.10)
This equation can be used to estimate the heat rejection Qw if the radiator operates
at a given temperature T or, conversely, the required temperature to reject a given
amount of heat.

7.4.3.5 View factors. The expression for the net radiation exchange gnet
between two surfaces that are perfect emitters (s = 1) and perfect absorbers (a = 1),
that is, black surfaces, is given by
GNeti-2 - A,F1_2a(r,4 - 724) (7.11)
QNet2-l-A2F2_1a(r4-ri4) (7.12)
In Eq. (7.12) the absolute temperatures of the surfaces are T\ and r2, a is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is area, and the F terms are view factors. A radia-
tion view factor is defined as that fraction of the radiant energy directly incident
on a receiving surface relative to the total radiant energy leaving the sending sur-
face. For example, if the view factor Fj_2 = 0.5, this means that one-half of the
radiant energy leaving surface 1 will strike surface 2 via a direct path from surface
1 to surface 2. The term "direct path" means that radiation from surface 1 that
arrives at surface 2 because of reflections off of other surfaces is not included in
the view factor computation. Two useful characteristics of view factors are that
the sum of all of the view factors from a surface must equal 1 and the reciprocity
rule AXFX-Y = AyFy-x. View factors, in general, are extremely difficult to evalu-
ate except for the simplest geometry. Fortunately, there are existing solutions for
many situations, as illustrated in Fig. 7.9. Also, there are powerful computer pro-
grams, such as TRASYS (Thermal Radiation Analysis System), that can be used to
evaluate view factors for essentially any geometry. TRASYS was developed by
Martin Marietta under contract to NASA Johnson Space Center.
The utility of the data given in Fig. 7.9 can be greatly expanded using view factor
algebra. This concept is beyond the scope of this text, however. The development
of this technique is discussed in Ref. 9.
7.4.3.6 Oppenheim radiation networks. Equation (7.12) provides a means
of calculating radiant energy exchange between "black" surfaces. In Fig. 7.10 an
approach is presented that can be used to determine the radiation exchange between
nonblack surfaces. The restrictions for this approach, developed by Oppenheim,10
are as follows:
1) All surfaces are "gray," that is, all surface emissivities are constant over the
wavelength bands applicable to the operating temperatures.
2) All surfaces emit and reflect diffusely. (Most surfaces can be considered
diffuse except for shiny metallic surfaces.)
3) All surfaces are isothermal.
4) The radiosities are uniform across each surface. Radiosity is defined as the
total radiant energy striking a surface including emitted, reflected, re-reflected, etc.
(For most radiation problems it is reasonable to assume uniform radiosity.)
The characteristics of the Oppenheim network are such that at each given sur-
face, say surface jc, the adjacent conductor is of the form Axsx/(l - £A), where A
is area and e is emissivity of the surface. This conductor is connected between the
surface node and the dummy Jx node. The potential at the surface node is cr(rx)4
and cr(Tj)4 at the J node. The network is completed by connecting each J node
to every other J node. The conductors connecting the J nodes are of the form
AxFx-y, where A is area and F the view factor. If a given surface is perfectly
insulated or if the emissivity of the node is one (a black surface), the conductor

7.4.3.7 Sample problem using an Oppenheim network. The Oppen-
heim approach for analyzing radiation problems is an extremely useful tool. An
example problem using this technique is illustrated in Fig. 7.11. The first step in
the solution is to determine the necessary view factors. Using Fig. 7.9, the view
factor from the radiator to the wall is found to be 0.29. Because the sum of all
view factors from the radiator must equal unity, the view factor from the radiator

to space equals (1 — FR-W) — 1 — 0-29 = 0.71. The view factor from the wall to
space is found by first using reciprocity to find the view factor from the wall to the
radiator ARFR_w = AwFw-R. This results in a value of 0.145 for FW-R- All of
the view factors from the wall must sum to unity; therefore, the view factor from
the wall to space FW-s equals (1 - FW_R) = 1 - 0.145 = 0.855.
The next step in the solution is the creation of the Oppenheim network. The
network on the lower left-hand side of Fig. 7.11 is basic representation for the
problem with As/(I — s) type conductors connecting the surface nodes (with
aT4 potentials) to the J nodes. The / nodes are connected to each other with
conductors made up of the area times the view factor. The network on the left of
Fig. 7.11 can be immediately reduced to the network shown on the right side of
the figure by noting the following characteristics of Oppenheim networks. First,
the net heat flow to a surface is given by the conductor value at the surface node
[As/(I — s)] times the adjoining potential difference crT4 — J. If a surface is
perfectly insulated, there can be no net heat transfer to the surface; therefore, for
this situation a T4 — J because the conductor [As/(I — s)] is a finite number. This
causes the elimination of the conductor [Aw£w/(l ~ £w)]- If a surface is "black"
with an emissivity of one, the conductor adjacent to the surface goes to infinity.
This has the effect of shorting the conductor and causes the node surface potential
(aT4 ) to be one-and-the-same with the J node. This allows the elimination of the
Av£v/(l — £s) conductor at the space node.

THERMAL CONTROL 391
7.4.4 Combined Radiation and Conduction Thermal Networks
The network approach of modeling is convenient for organizing and visual-
izing radiation problems. Conduction heat-transfer problems are also commonly
modeled using thermal networks. For conduction problems the potential at node
points is the temperature to the first power, not temperature to the fourth power as
is the case in radiation. The conductor value is the quantity that is multiplied by
the temperature difference in the steady-state conduction equations, shown later
in this section. For example, the conductor for rectangular geometry is kA/Ax
(conductivity times cross-sectional area divided by distance).
For most spacecraft thermal control problems, conduction and radiation heat-
transfer modes are interrelated. This forces the coupling of conduction and ra-
diation and makes it highly desirable to combine the conduction and radiation
networks. The problem with combining the two networks is that the potentials are
vastly different: conduction to the first power and radiation to the fourth power of
the temperature. This difference is overcome by manipulating the radiation rela-
tionship. In general the radiation equation is given by q = (a coefficient) times
(crT? - o-7\4). The coefficient is of the form exAx/(l - ex) or AxFx-y. Working
with the temperature to the fourth-power term, first the Stefan-Boltzmann con-
stant is factored, and then the remaining temperature term is also factored to yield
[(Tx2 + T^)(TX + Ty)](Tx — Ty)]. This operation transforms the radiation equation to
a form that includes the temperature difference to the first power with the remain-
ing terms forming a temperature-dependent conductor. The radiation conductor
values are given by
2 + 7-2(7i + 7>) (7.16)
or
(aA,F,_v)[(rA2 + T2) (Tx + Ty)] (7.17)
7.4.5 Generalized Thermal Networks
Generalized equations for solving thermal networks will now be developed.
For this development the steady-state networks discussed to this point have been
extended to include transient conditions. The only difference in the steady-state
and transient cases is that a thermal capacitance has been added at the node points.
The nodes represent finite volumes or pieces of the physical thermal system, and
the thermal capacitance of a node is the node mass times the specific heat of
the node material. There are two formulations of the generalized equation in the
following paragraphs: an implicit and an explicit solution. The explicit solution
allows a step-by-step application of the equation at each node until all nodes are
updated and the time step is complete. The implicit solution requires the inversion
of a matrix involving all of the nodes at each time step. When using the explicit
approach, the size of the time step is limited to a critical time step, and if this limit
is exceeded, numerical instabilities might occur. This restriction does not apply to
the implicit approach; however, one must be careful and generally not exceed the
explicit critical time step by more than a factor of two or three in order to main-
tain accuracy. Steady-state solutions are readily analyzed using the given transient

Equations (7.20) and (7.21) correspond to Fig. 7.12 and are used in the general-
ized thermal analyzer computer programs that thermally model spacecraft. These

The thermal network shown in Fig. 7.13 is used to model a space radiator fin.
The aluminum fin is 30-cm wide, 0.2-cm thick, and 1-m long (into the plane of the
paper). The left edge, or base, of the fin is maintained at a constant temperature of
340 K by the radiator's working fluid. The node representing the base is labeled
Tl while the 10-cm wide fin nodes are labeled T2, T3, and T4. The bottom side
of the fin is perfectly insulated; the top is exposed to deep space and solar heating.
The solar vector is assumed to be normal to the radiator surface, and the surface
radiation properties are assumed to be 0.2 for the solar absorptivity and 0.8 for the
IR emissivity. The definitions and values for the elements of the thermal network are
given above. The values of the radiation conductors Rl, R2, and R3 are derived by
constructing an Oppenheim radiation network between the surface and deep space.
Because the fin node surfaces only "see" deep space, the Oppenheim conductors
can be combined to the single conductor shown between the fin surface and space.
The solution of the fin problem is shown in Fig. 7.14. The curve given in the
figure represents the steady-state values of the fin temperatures. It was assumed
that initially the fin was at a uniform temperature of 340 K. It took approximately
25 min (problem time) for the fin temperatures to gradually change from their

7.5 Preliminary Design
7.5.7 Approach
The purpose of Section 7.4 was to provide an introduction to the mathematical
techniques used in spacecraft design. The purpose of this section is to develop
a technique that will provide a preliminary, first-order estimate of the thermal
performance of a spacecraft. This estimate will bound the spacecraft thermal design
and provide a basis for estimating the engineering and computer time required to
develop the detailed spacecraft thermal design. A description of the preliminary
design process is given in Table 7.3, and a numerical example of the preliminary
design process is presented later in this chapter.
The specific conditions that are used in the preliminary design process are as
follows: 1) the spacecraft directly overhead at high noon and at the equator and
2) the spacecraft in the Earth's shadow with no view of sunlit portions of the
Earth's surface. These two situations correspond to worst-case hot and worst-
case cold conditions. The basic spacecraft geometry that will be considered in the
preliminary design process is spherical. Also, worst-case hot and worst-case cold
equations will be developed for a flat plate in space. The flat plate is considered
to be a solar array whose surface normal is parallel to the solar vector and passes
through the center of the Earth.
7.5.2 Development of Equations
We will first consider a solar array and assume that the array is thin and
isothermal; the "top" surface of the array receives direct solar energy while the
"bottom" surface receives albedo and Earth IR radiation. The direct solar energy
absorbed by the array in space is the product of the solar constant, times the area,
times the solar absorptivity of the array surface:
tffl-ds = GsAas-t (7.23)
where qa-fe is the absorbed direct solar energy, Gs is the solar constant
(1371 W/m2), A is the area of the array (the area of the top of the array is A
and area of the bottom of the array is A), and as-t is the solar absorptivity of the
solar cells on the top surface of the array.
The IR energy flux at the Earth's surface is 237 W/m2. Therefore, the total IR
energy leaving the Earth's surface is 237 times the surface area of the Earth. The
IR energy flux at the spacecraft altitude is the total IR energy divided by the area of
a sphere with a radius equal to the Earth's radius plus the altitude of the spacecraft.
Thus,

where qa-\R is the absorbed Earth IR radiation on the bottom of the array, A is the
area of the bottom of the array, and £IR_£ is the IR emissivity of the bottom surface
of the array. The quantities q\^ and Fa-e have already been defined.
The equation for the solar energy reflected off the Earth (albedo) and absorbed
by the spacecraft is similar to the preceding equation for Earth IR radiation:
qa-a = GsaFa-eActs-bKa (7.27)
Ka = 0.657 + 0.54 E - 0.196 (7.28)
where qa-a is the energy absorbed on the bottom surface of the solar array caused
by solar energy reflected from the Earth, Gs is the solar constant (1371 W/m2), a
is the albedo (the percentage of direct solar energy reflected off the Earth, approx-
imately 30%), Ftt-e is the view factor from the array to the Earth [Eq. (7.25)], and
RE is the radius of the Earth. H is the altitude of the spacecraft, A is the area of
the bottom of the array, a,s-b is the solar absorptivity of the bottom surface of the
array, and Ka is a factor, which accounts for the reflection of collimated incoming
solar energy off a spherical Earth.

IR emissivity of the top surface of the array, and T is the temperature of the array.
We can now perform an energy balance on the solar array:
^absorbed ~ Remitted ~~ ^electron generation = 0 (7.32)
For a solar array the energy balanced equation includes an electrical generation
term because the solar cells convert solar energy directly to electrical energy. There
is some dissipation associated with solar arrays (diodes, interconnect cabling, and
transmission losses); however, these losses are accounted for in the array efficiency

The terms used in Eq. (7.34) are defined after Eq. (7.39). If the array is in the
shadow of the Earth and is not in view of any portion of the sunlit parts of the
Earth, then we have a worst-case cold condition. For this condition there is no
direct solar, albedo, or electric power generation. The equation that defines the

The terms used in Eq. (7.35) are defined after Eq. (7.39). Worst-case hot-

For the sphere it is assumed that there is uniform energy dissipation over the entire
surface of the sphere. Also, it is assumed there is no electrical generation on the

7.6 Preliminary Design Process
Equations (7.34-7.37) define steady-state temperatures. An actual spacecraft
will likely exhibit lower maximum temperatures and higher minimum temperatures
than those predicted by the equations as a result of transient effects. Nevertheless,
these equations can be used to provide reasonable first-order estimates of space-
craft thermal performance. An example of the use of Eqs. (7.34) and (7.35) to
predict solar-array temperatures is given in Fig. 7.15. In this figure the maximum
altitude is 35786 km, the Earth geosynchronous orbit altitude. The parameters used
in the construction of the figure are as follows: incident radiation =1371 W/m2,
albedo = 30%, Earth IR = 237 W/m2, array efficiency = 8%, absorptivity
(top) = 0.805, absorptivity (bottom) = 0.3, emissivity (top) = 0.825, and emissivity
(bottom) = 0.8.
Equations (7.36) and (7.37) are used as the major elements of the preliminary
design process shown in Table 7.3. A numerical example of this process follows,

maximum power dissipation of 170 W, a minimum power dissipation of 80 W, and
an altitude of 700 km.
The first step in the process is to establish the equipment temperature limits.
Referring to Table 7.1, we find that the typical temperature range for electronics is
0 to 40°C, and for batteries the range is from 5 to 20°C. Next, estimate the electrical
power dissipation of the spacecraft. If possible, determine the power consistent
with the worst-case hot condition and the power consistent with the worst-case
cold condition. If this is not possible to determine, use the orbital average value
for both conditions. Compute the diameter of a spherical spacecraft, which has
a surface area equal to the actual spacecraft. This is done so that we can use the
equations that have been developed for an isothermal sphere and obtain first-order
estimates of the spacecraft's thermal performance. For this calculation assume a
solar absorptivity of 0.316 and an emissivity of 0.8. These values are consistent
with aluminized Teflon® properties and represent radiation property values that are
readily obtainable. We have used a value for the solar absorptivity that is higher
than the values shown in Table 7.2. This is to allow for UV degradation of the
radiation surface, which is discussed later in this chapter.
The results of the performance calculations for the spacecraft are given in
Table 7.4. The high side values of the environmental radiation fluxes are used
for the worst-case hot conditions, and the low side values are used for the worst-
case cold conditions. The results of the analyses are a worst-case hot temperature
of —8.5°C and a worst-case cold temperature of —86.5°C. These values tell us that
from an overall standpoint the spacecraft will be relatively easy to thermally con-
trol because the worst-case hot temperature is well below the upper limit of 20° C
for the batteries and 40°C for the electronics. If the worst-case hot temperature
had been 50 or 60°C, we would know that the spacecraft could not be controlled
using body-mounted radiators and deployed radiators with a pumped loop system
would probably be required.
Equation (7.10) is used to assess the performance of a body-mounted radiator.
For line 19 of Table 7.4, it is assumed that the radiator temperature is 35°C
(40°C upper equipment limit — 5°C thermal margin), there are no environmental
heat inputs, and the heat dissipation is 170 W. The radiator area required for
these conditions is 0.42-m2. The assumed spacecraft dimensions are a 1.5-m cube;
therefore, a 0.42-m2 body-mounted radiator can easily be accommodated. Line
20 on Table 7.4 illustrates a check on the performance of the 0.42-m2 radiation
consistent with worst-case cold conditions. For this situation it is assumed that the
heat dissipation is 80 W, which produces a radiator temperature of — 18.4°C. This
temperature is considerably below the lower limit of 5°C (0°C lower equipment
limit +5°C thermal margin). Therefore, the radiator will require a thermal louver to
modulate the heat flow or a thermostat and heater to maintain the temperature above
the lower limit. The heater power required to maintain the radiator at 5°C is 33.8 W
(computation on line 21 of Table 7.4). This power at the radiator is in addition to
the 80 W that is dissipated from the electrical and electronic equipment. We have
not attempted to maintain the spacecraft equipment within the battery temperature
limits. We will isolate the battery from the other spacecraft equipment and provide
thermal control separately for this device. The probable approach will be to cold
bias the battery and thermally control the battery temperature with heaters and
thermostats.

7.7 Thermophysical Properties
7.7.1 Multilayer Insulation
Thermophysical properties of selected materials are given in Table 7.5. The val-
ues for the multilayer insulation are extremely low. These values are for laboratory
conditions and are not representative of values obtainable on an actual spacecraft.
Actual performance of multilayer insulation is given in Fig. 7.16. The performance
value used in Fig. 7.16 is effective emittance (emissivity), rather than conductivity.
Effective emittance is defined as
q = creeff(T? - (7.40)
In Eq. (7.40) a is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, eeff is the effective blanket
emissivity, and Tx and Ty are absolute temperatures.
The effective emittance is related to conductivity by the following expression:
fieff = ke« [°&x (T,2 + T2) (Tx + Ty)] (7.41)

Fig. 7.16 Multilayer insulation performance. (Copyright AIAA, reproduced with
permission; Ref. 13.)
In Eq. (7.41) k^ represents the effective blanket conductivity, and A* is the blanket
thickness.
The thermal performance of multilayer insulation is given in Fig. 7.16. In this
figure SCI stands for science scan platform, MAG for magnetometer, PROP for
propellant, CALOR for calorimeter, and F & G for the Pioneer spacecraft series
designations. An important conclusion drawn from Fig. 7.16 is that the effective-
ness of multilayer insulation is generally dependent on the size of the object being
insulated. Large multilayer insulation systems generally will exhibit a lower ef-
fective emissivity than small systems. This occurs because edge effects, joints,
seams, and penetrations (electrical wires, structural supports) in multilayer insu-
lation represent relatively high extraneous heat leak paths through the insulation.
Generally, large multilayer insulation systems will have a smaller percentage of
extraneous heat leak paths than small systems. In Fig. 7.16 calorimeters and cryo-
genic tanks represent multilayer systems with low discontinuity densities. Most
unmanned spacecraft and propulsion systems correspond to medium discontinuity
densities, whereas highly complex spacecraft and science platforms generally have
high discontinuity densities.

404 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
7.7.2 Radiation Properties
Radiation properties are given in Table 7.2. The surface providing the lowest
temperature when irradiated by solar energy is an optical solar reflector (OSR).
These devices have been used on spacecraft, but are both fragile and costly. One
type of optical solar reflector is silver-coated Teflon®. This material does not
provide as low a temperature as high-quality quartz optical solar reflectors, but is
much less expensive and much more durable. In recent years silver-coated and/or
aluminum-coated Teflon® have been used extensively on the outer surfaces of
spacecraft.
7.8 Design Considerations
All aspects of spacecraft thermal control, obviously, cannot be covered in this
chapter. However, some of the more important items, with regard to spacecraft
thermal control design, will be discussed in the remainder of this section.
Table 7.6 provides information for preliminary weight estimates of thermal
control hardware items. The values from this table should be used with caution
because they are only first-order estimates.
One of the elements of a thermal control subsystem that is difficult to predict is
the resistance to heat flow across solid-to-solid interfaces. Thermal control subsys-
tems often have important heat-transfer paths across interfaces, for example, heat
dissipating components bolted to cold plates. The thermal performance of an inter-
face is characterized as joint conductance and is defined by the following equation:
Q = hcAAT (7.42)
In Eq. (7.42) Q is the heat-transfer rate across the interface in watts, A is the inter-
face area in square meters, AT is the temperature difference across the interface
in degrees Kelvin, and hc is the joint conductance, W/(m2-K).

THERMAL CONTROL 405
The difficulty in predicting joint conductance is that this property is dependent on
the surface finish, hardness of the interface surfaces, the waviness of the interface
surfaces, and the interface pressure. A typical value for aluminum surfaces is
4500 W/(m2-°K); however, this value can vary greatly depending on circumstances.
Because of the difficulty in predicting contact conductance, it is necessary to
measure this quantity at the component level and then use the measured values in
the spacecraft thermal models.
In Table 7.2 the values of solar absorptivity are all beginning-of-life values. This
means the materials have not been subjected to the space environment, which will
cause degradation of the solar absorptivity with time as a result primarily of UV ra-
diation. The degradation is exponential in nature with an upper limit. For example,
the aluminized Teflon® listed in Table 7.2 has an upper limit solar absorptivity of
0.316. The amount of time of solar exposure required for the materials to approach
the upper limit, or asymptotic value, is from 3,000 to 12,000 h. In analyzing the
thermal performance of a spacecraft, the beginning-of-life and end-of-life values
of thermal coatings must be considered to define the temperature extremes during
the entire mission.
Multilayer insulation is a primary hardware component for spacecraft thermal
control subsystems. This material, however, requires care with regard to installing,
modeling, and testing. For example, overlapping multilayer blankets at joints will
greatly degrade the thermal performance of the insulation. If penetrations are not
accounted for correctly in thermal models, the analytical predictions will not match
the test results. This happened on a thermal vacuum test of the Hubble Space Tele-
scope. Also, test times must be long enough for the air within multilayer blankets to
vent. Even though multilayer blankets are routinely perforated, it may take several
hours in a space chamber for the entrapped air to vent so the blanket performs as
it would in space.
In this section many of the hardware elements of a thermal control system have
been described. The question remains, which hardware elements should be used,
or even considered, for a given spacecraft? This question is often answered in
practice by performing trade studies to determine the most effective components
to use for a given situation. The criteria used in trade studies usually involves
thermal performance, cost, weight, reliability, availability, safety, and durability.

Problems
7.1 A spherical spacecraft is used for a near solar mission. The outer skin of
the spacecraft is made of a material that has a high thermal conductivity, and the
spacecraft is spin stabilized. These two conditions cause the temperature of the
spacecraft's outer skin to be uniform. The emissivity £JR and the absorptivity as of
the outer skin are 0.85 and 0.1, respectively. If steady-state conditions are assumed
and there is no heat generation within the spacecraft, what is the skin temperature,
in degrees Celsius, if the solar constant is 8? This means that the solar flux is
8 x 1371 = 10968 W/m2.
7.2 A spherical fuel tank is insulated with 8 cm of fiberglass. The tank outside
diameter is 0.7 m, and the tank wall is at — 195.2°C. If the outer surface of the
insulation is a 27°C, what is the heat loss in watts? The thermal conductivity of
the insulation is 0.00865 W/(m-K).
7.3 Multilayer insulation is used to thermally isolate a high-temperature compo-
nent with a spacecraft science instrument. This insulation is made of five layers of
aluminum foil, which are separated by a transparent material. The inner layer of
the aluminum is at 282°C while the outer layer is at 4.8°C. Neglect all conduction
and convection effects and calculate the radiant loss on a square-meter basis. The
infrared emissivity SIR of the foil is 0.1, and it is assumed that the foils are infinite
parallel plates. Express answer in watts/square meter.
7.4 A rectangular enclosure has a base of 2 x 4 m and a height of 6 m. What is
the view factor from a) the base to the 2 x 4 m top, b) from the base to the 2 x 6 m
side, and c) from the base to the 4 x 6 m side?
7.5 A flat space radiator is mounted on the surface of a spacecraft and perfectly
insulated on the inside. The area of the radiator is 0.6 x 0.6 m with a solar
absorptivity of 0.15 and an IR emissivity of 0.8. If the solar vector is at an angle of
45 deg relative to the normal to the radiator, the incident solar flux is 1371 W/m2,
and the radiator temperature is 93.7°C, what is the power rejected by the radiator.
Express answer in watts. Neglect albedo and Earth IR radiation.

7.6 Two directly opposed, parallel circular disks are floating in space and 0.6
m apart. The diameter of the disks are both 1.2 m, and they are both shaded from
the sun, albedo, and Earth IR radiation. The IR emissivity of both disks is 0.4, and
one of the disks (disk a) is maintained at a temperature of 150°C. The other disk
(disk b) is thin and highly conductive so that the temperature on both sides is the
same. What is the temperature of disk b in degrees Celsius?
7.7 A proposed spacecraft is cylindrical in shape with a diameter of 1.2 m and
a length of 2 m. The orbit altitude is 150 km, the maximum power dissipation
is 1500 W, and the minimum power dissipation is 500 W. Assume the maximum
power occurs when the spacecraft is in the sunlight and the minimum occurs
when the spacecraft is in the Earth's shadow. Using the preliminary design process
outlined on Table 7.4, estimate the worst-case hot and worst-case cold temperatures
for this proposed spacecraft.

Command and Data System
8.1 Introduction
The command and data system (CDS), sometimes called the command and data
handling (C&DH) system, is the central nervous system for the spacecraft. The
system manages three digital data streams, each critical to the spacecraft and each
with distinctive characteristics. These data streams are as folllows:
1) Science or payload data. This is the information the spacecraft was sent to
get. It is gathered by the spacecraft, processed onboard, and downlinked to the
ground. It is usually the highest data rate on the spacecraft.
2) Engineering data. This is the information with which the ground operations
team can determine the status and health of each subsystem on the spacecraft.
Engineering data are usually downlinked at a medium data rate, substantially
lower than the science rate.
3) Commands. The command link is an uplink from the ground at a low data
rate. Commands are instructions to the spacecraft dictating configuration, attitude,
and actions at particular times. Accuracy is the primary requirement in handling
this data stream. A single bit error in the science data stream or the engineering
data stream is not serious. It may cause some temporary consternation among the
ground team but it is not dangerous. An error in the command stream is dangerous
and can be life threatening. Extreme care is taken in the preparation, testing, and
transmission of the command stream.
The CDS and the communications systems are closely related, as shown in
Fig. 8.1, the block diagram for a typical CDS. The computer is central to the
CDS system. The computer may serve all of the spacecraft computational needs,
sharing computer time with the attitude control system. Alternatively two com-
puters may be provided: one specialized for data handling and one specialized
for the attitude control computations. Magellan is a recent spacecraft that used
dual specialized computers, and Mars Observer is a recent spacecraft that used a
multipurpose computer for data and attitude-control computation. The CDS has
significant interaction with the telecommunication subsystem, the attitude con-
trol system, and the power system. In addition, the CDS has command and data-
gathering interfaces with all of the subsystems on the spacecraft.
In commanding, the CDS system receives command signals from the radio fre-
quency (rf) link through a command detector unit, authenticates the commands,
performs onboard processing, and executes both internally generated and exter-
nally received commands. The CDS also provides for the generation of precise
spacecraft clock data for the spacecraft. Spacecraft time is used to annotate data
and to execute time-tagged commands. The data handling functions are to collect,
digitize, format, encode, route, store, and play back the three major data types. The
system provides digital storage for all three data types. Storage media is usually

solid-state memory, although tape recorders were used extensively in the recent
past.
The International Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems1 (CCSDS)
is an influential force in the design of CDS systems and will be referenced often
in this chapter. This international committee has members from the United
Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, European Space Agency, Brazil, Japan,
Russia, and the United States. Its purpose is to recommend standard ways of
handling data and commands both for spacecraft and ground so that equipment,
especially ground equipment, can be standardized. Two benefits are expected: 1)
multinational ground stations can be used to receive and handle data from space-
craft of any nation and 2) the considerable cost of ground stations may be reduced.
As a result of this committee, the CDS system is the most nearly standardized
system on a spacecraft. (The voluminous committee recommendations are posted
on the Internet at www.ccsds.org.)
In the following sections the data handling function will be discussed first
and then the command handling function, which is simpler in concept but abso-
lutely critical to the spacecraft. The computer and software will be discussed last.
(Although computers and software are used elsewhere in the spacecraft, notably
in ACS, they are discussed in this chapter only.)
8.2 Requirements
The requirements for the CDS system derive directly from the data rates of the
science instruments, the engineering data rates, and the command rates. These,
coupled with the downlink schedule and the instrument data schedules, determine

COMMAND AND DATA SYSTEM 411
the data flow timeline through the system. The timeline determines the data storage
requirement and the downlink data rates for telecommunication.
8.2.1 Engineering Data
It is essential for the ground operations personnel to be able to determine the
status, health, and performance of each subsystem in near real time. Collectively,
the measurements required for this evaluation are called engineering data. In the
design phase each subsystem is analyzed to determine potential failure modes
and the effects of these failures. There are numerous purposes for these analy-
ses. One is to determine the measurements required to evaluate normal and fail-
ure situations. These measurements become the engineering measurement list.
Typical measurements are temperatures, pressures, voltages, currents, wheel
speeds, rotational positions, ACS sensor outputs, and status measurements. Status
measurements are inherently digital valve positions, switch on/off positions, relay
positions, and safe/arm positions. The engineering data stream is sometimes called
telemetry.
8.2.2 Science or Payload Data
The spacecraft is designed around the payload data. For a scientific spacecraft
the instruments are as varied as scientific imagination. The Cassini spacecraft,
for example, carries six different types of spectrometer, an imaging system that
operates in the near-ultraviolet and near-infrared, as well as an imaging radar. It
also carries a cosmic dust analyzer, a magneto spheric analyzer, a radio science
subsystem, and a dual technique magnetometer. In addition it carries a probe with
an additional set of instruments.
In the communication satellite world the payload is a set of communication
relay equipment, the selection of which is determined by technology and market
considerations. Earth resource satellites carry multifrequency imaging instruments
of ever improving efficiency, sensitivity, and size. LANDSAT VII, for example,
scans eight frequency bands at a minimum resolution of 15 m with whole Earth
coverage. The instrument data rate is as high as 300 Mbps. The large telescopes, like
Hubble and Chandra, return images with attendant high data rates. The Chandra
downlink rate is from 32 to 1024 kbps.
8.2.3 Data Rates
In general the payload design is reasonably well defined at the start of the
spacecraft design process, and the instrument data rates are defined. Command
data rates and engineering data rates are difficult to estimate in the early phases
of a program, and estimating by analogy to a similar spacecraft may be the best
approach. Table 8.1 shows command and engineering data rates for some typical
planetary spacecraft.
Table 8.1 shows several spacecraft with commandable rates for the command
stream and for the engineering data stream. It is highly desirable to increase both
of these rates during critical events in the spacecraft mission. For example, during
interplanetary cruise a spacecraft does not make many changes of state, and so high
rate commanding is not necessary; a low engineering data rate is acceptable as well.

Conversely, for near planetary encounter, high data rates and high command rates
are essential. The Mars Global Surveyor command and engineering data rates are
a good starting place for planetary spacecraft.
It is also desirable to vary the sample rate of many measurements as a function
of mission mode. For example, the orbit insertion propulsion system is inert during
cruise, and widely spaced measurements are acceptable; once per hour would be
adequate. However, near the time of orbit insertion and during the insertion, burn
events will be happening in milliseconds and the data system maximum sample
rate will be required.
Table 8.2 shows similar data for Earth orbiting spacecraft. Earth orbiters can
enjoy much higher command and engineering data rates, as shown in the table
Chandra rates would make a reasonable starting point for a modern Earth orbiter.

8.2.4 Computer Requirements
Computer requirements are derived from timing and sizing analysis; see
Section 8.5.
8.2.5 Functional Requirements
Functional requirements come primarily from project and customer top docu-
ments. Typical functional requirements are as follows:
1) Direct acting, time critical commands shall not be required for normal
operation.
2) It shall not be physically possible to turn off both command receivers at the
same time.
3) Critical/irreversible events require two commands for one critical event.
4) To avoid ambiguous spacecraft states, toggle commands shall not be used.
5) The spacecraft shall be commandable to known states without knowledge of
current state.
6) The spacecraft shall be capable of telemetering the contents of any computer
memory.
7) Onboard computer memory shall be reprogrammable in flight.
8) All enable/disable states must be telemetered.
9) Commandable variation in engineering data sample rate is highly desirable
for certain measurements.
10) The fault protection system shall allow ground commanding of enable/
disable states.
11) The engineering data stream shall be designed to allow rapid and unambigu-
ous determination of spacecraft state at the start of a data downlink. In particular,
it must be possible to quickly determine if the spacecraft has executed a fault
protection response.
8.3 Data Handling
Two kinds of data are handled by the CDS: 1) science data or pay load data,
the information the spacecraft was sent to get, and 2) engineering data, the mea-
surements that portray spacecraft system health and performance. The sequence
of data processing, for both engineering and payload data, is shown in Fig. 8.2.
Each data measurement is collected at the instrument; analog measurements are
converted to an equivalent digital data stream.
Extra bits are added to the data to record the instrument, time, date, and possibly
other information. These additional bits are called overhead. There are a number of
ways the data can be identified. Any method requires additional bits. The overhead
requirement is usually expressed as a percentage of the total data rate. The data
stream after overhead is calculated as follows.
Consider a data stream of 100,000 bps and an overhead rate of 10%. The over-
head bits are added by dividing by 0.9:
100,000bit rate with overhead — ———— = 111,111 bps0.9 F

It is a common mistake to add 10%, yielding 110,000 bps, which is incorrect and
leads to a significant error (11 % in this case). The larger the bit rate or the overhead
rate, the larger magnitude of the error.
The measurement may then be encrypted, if the mission is classified. Next, the
data from a single instrument is multiplexed with all other measurements on the
spacecraft to form a data block.
The data can be stored for transmission later or transmitted immediately. In either
case the data will be encoded before transmission. Encoding is a process that adds
extra bits for error detection and correction. There are a number of ingenious
methods of encoding to be discussed later. Each of these steps is described in
more detail in subsequent sections. The section numbers for each step are shown
in Fig. 8.2.
8.3.1 Analog to Digital Conversion
Most engineering instruments deliver an analog measurement. Conversely the
entire spacecraft is a digital machine. Analog information collected from instru-
ments is converted to digital form before transmission. The steps in conversion
are 1) analog data are sampled as a function of time, 2) each sample is quantized
(converted to the nearest digital data number), 3) each data sample is expressed as
a digital word, 4) the digital words are inserted into a serial digital bit stream, and
5) the digital stream is transmitted to Earth; see Chapter 9.0.
Nyquist showed in 1928 that, to reconstruct an analog signal from a digital
stream, it must be sampled at a frequency at least twice as high as the maximum
frequency component in the analog signal. If Nyquist's criteria are not met, the
signal cannot be reconstructed. Practical considerations dictate that Nyquist's limit
be exceeded with margin. Wertz2 suggests the sampling rate should be at least 2.2
times the maximum frequency component of the signal. For example, the maximum
frequency component of music is about 20 kHz; commercial audio compact disks
record music at a digital sampling rate of 44.1 ksps.
Note that when the data are quantized, a quantization error is introduced, which
is similar to a round off error in computation. Figure 8.3 shows an analog measure-
ment being quantized into a three-bit word. An n bit word (or byte) can discriminate

277 levels; a three-bit word can discriminate 8 levels. The difference between the
natural sample value and the quantized sample value is the quantization error.
The quantization error can be reduced by increasing the number of bits used to
describe the sample. Table 8.3 shows the quantization error, as a percentage of full
scale, as a function of bits per sample.
Three bits per sample is commonly used for engineering data. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) Mariner series used 256 shades of gray (n = 8) to quantize
imaging data. The number of bits per sample times the number of samples per
second produces the number of bits per measurement. The sum of the bit rates
from all of the measurements on the spacecraft is the spacecraft data rate. For

any spacecraft there will be a number of mission modes; Magellan examples are
cruise mode, orbit insertion, and mapping modes. Each spacecraft mode will have
its own data rate. The rate at which data are being collected is not necessarily the
downlink rate of the communication system; the data may be either downlinked
or stored. In normal cruise mode Magellan collected data and downlinked it at 40
bps (real-time transmission). In mapping mode, data were collected at 806.4 kbps
and stored in the tape recorder for later downlink at 268.8 kbps.
8.3.2 Encrypt/Decrypt
Certain missions, notably military missions, require encryption of the down-
link and decryption of the uplink. The equipment to perform these functions will
normally be supplied by the government and will be long-lead items. They are
highly classified and will require special handling. Functionally they will repre-
sent the slowest part of the link; commands will come through at a few per second.
They represent a single-point failure and the system design should consider both
redundancy and bypass capability.
8.3.3 Encoding
The purpose of coding is to locate and correct data bits that are corrupted in
the communication process; that is, to reduce the bit error rate (BER). The error
probability can be reduced by increasing the information bandwidth (data rate).
Coding takes advantage of this principle by mapping k data bits into n symbols,
where n is always larger than k. The term "symbols" is used to describe a bit stream
that contains coding. For a crude example, data could be transmitted twice and
compared on the ground to find corrupted bits. The data rate would be doubled
(n — 2 k)\ the symbol rate would be twice the data rate. This crude coding technique
would find errors; it would not, however, provide enough information to correct
errors. It would take a triple transmission to find and correct errors using two out
of three voting.
There are a very large number of more elegant and efficient coding schemes
available. This chapter will review the most common of the coding schemes that
have been studied and used. The error reduction performance of these schemes
will be compared along with the attendant data rate increase.4
CCSDS recommends the use of Reed-Solomon (255,223) for the downlink data,
both engineering and science. If Reed-Solomon encoding does not adequately
reduce the error rate, then convolutional coding may be used in addition. Used
this way, the Reed-Solomon code is the outer code and convolutional code is the
inner code. The CCSDS recommendation for uplink (commands) is BCH(63, 56)
coding. There are two different fundamental approaches to coding: block codes
and convolutional codes. Both are described in subsequent sections.
8.3.3.1 Block coding. In block coding,4 the uncoded data are divided into
blocks of k bits; the block may or may not be the same length as a word. Parity bits
are added to each block of k bits, producing a larger block of n symbols. If the
number of ones in the block is even, the parity is even. Conversely, if the number
of ones in a block is odd the parity of the block is odd. In even parity coding, if
the number of ones in the block is odd, a parity bit of 1 is added to the block to
produce even parity. If the number of ones in a block of data is even, the parity

bit added will be 0, which maintains even parity. A parity bit is added to a data
word to make the sum of the bits even for even parity code (or odd for odd parity
code). For example, the sum of the digits in the word 0101110 is even; therefore,
the parity bit would be 0 in even parity code. Conversely, the sum of the digits in
the word 0111000 is odd and the parity bit would be 1.
Table 8.4 shows an even parity (4, 3) block code with the parity bit left of data.
When the bit stream is received, the parity of each symbol block is checked;
if parity is odd, the block contains an error. The code in Table 8.4 can detect any
single or triple error in a block, and the error is located to the block level in the
symbol stream.
Block codes are characterized by the number of symbols bits n and the number
of data bits k, and referred to as (n, k) block code. The symbol block in Table 8.4 is
(4, 3). The ratio of redundant bits to data bits, (n — k)/k, is called the redundancy
of the code; the redundancy of the code in Table 8.4 is 1/3. The ratio of data bits
to symbol bits k/n is called the rate of the code; the rate in Table 8.4 is 3/4. A
block can transmit 2k distinct words (eight words in this example).
Clever arrangements of parity bits will allow error location and correction at the
bit level. If data are arranged in a two-dimensional block, and parity bits added
for each row and column, an erroneous bit will produce a parity error in both
row and column. Table 8.5 shows an even parity (36, 25) rectangular block code.

Fig. 8.4 Hamming Code block — parity bits shaded.
Parity errors give row and column of the erroneous bit; therefore, a bit error can
be detected, located, and corrected by the decoder.
8.3.3.2 Well-known block codes. Hamming5 codes are a family of block
codes devised by Richard Hamming of Bell Telephone Labs in 1950. These codes
place the parity bits in special positions in the symbol block. If the bit positions
are numbered starting from 1, then the parity bits are placed in those positions that
are powers of two; i.e., positions 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Conversely, the
data bits are in positions 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and so on. The symbol block then looks
like Fig. 8.4 with the parity bits shaded.
The parity bits make the sum of digits even (or odd) for a given subset of the
symbol block. Each position in the symbol block is part of the parity check for
those bits whose position numbers add up to the bit position. The symbol position
5 is checked by the parity bit in position 1 and 4 because 5 = 1+4. This causes
each position to be checked by a unique set of parity bits. The first parity bit is
summed over bit positions 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. The second parity bit is summed
over 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, and so on. The pattern of checks is said to be orthogonal
over the data block.
Devised by Bose-Chadhuri-Hocquehem, BCH codes4 are a powerful class of
Hamming code that allow multiple error correction. A BCH(63, 56) code is recom-
mended by the CCSDS for the all-important job of command transmission. BCH
codes outperform other block codes with the same block length and rate. For more
data on BCH codes see Sklar,4 p. 301.
Reed-Solomon (R-S) codes are a special subset of BCH codes that were dis-
covered before the BCH codes.4 The Reed-Solomon (255, 223) code is the block
code selected for standardization by the CCSDS telemetry guidelines. The bit rate
increase created by this code is a factor of 255/223, or 1.1434978. The selection
of R-S code may well have been because Reed-Solomon codes are particularly
suited to correcting burst errors and are effective where the set of input signals is
large.4 The code is capable of correcting any series of t or fewer symbol errors
where
t=n- (8.D
A symbol stream with an error rate of 10~2 can be improved by a factor of 104
with R-S coding at t = 4.
Two-dimensional Reed-Solomon codes have been devised that will detect and
correct very long burst errors. The inner code can correct burst errors of a few
bytes in length whereas the outer code can correct very long bursts.
The R-S code has another useful trait. A symbol stream emerging from the en-
coder presents k bits of unaltered data followed by k — n code correction symbols.
The unaltered bits are followed by a trailer of code. Thus the MOS team can read
and use the unaltered transmission while the bit stream is being decoded and error

corrected. This trait is very useful in times of high activity such as the approach to
planetary encounter.
8.3.3.3 Convolutional coding. Convolutional coding is a newer type of
coding that gives better bit error rate reduction than block coding for a given
symbol-to-bit ratio. In addition, the encoder is simpler to implement in hardware
than a block encoder. A linear block code is described by two integers, n and k. A
Convolutional code is described with three integers, n, k, and K, where the ratio
k/n has the same significance as with block codes; however, n does not define a
block length in Convolutional coding. The integer K is known as the constraint
length; it is the number of stages in the coding shift register. In practice, n and k
are small integers and K is used as the variable to control redundancy. Magellan
used rate 1/2, K — 7 Convolutional code and rate 1/2, K = 7, is the Convolutional
code selected for standardization by the CCSDS.
A rate 1/2, K = 7 Convolutional encoder is shown schematically in Fig. 8.5,
after Edelson,6 p. 157. The encoder has a seven bit register (K — 7); input data
bits enter the register from the left. There are two modulo-2 adders (rate 1/2) that
sum selected input bits in the register.
The selection of the bits associated with each adder is arbitrary. There is no
current theory to determine the best way to wire the adders. However, any change
in the adder wiring to the registers produces a different convolution code.
In each encoding step a single data bit is pushed into the register; existing bits
are shifted to the right 1 position; one bit is shifted out of the register. Adder 1
takes the modulo-2 sum of the data bits in registers 1, 3, and 6; then adder 2 takes
the modulo-2 sum of the data bits 4 and 7. The rules of modulo 2 addition are the
same as the rules of parity:
000 = 0
001 = 1
100=1
101=0
where 0 is the symbol for modulo-2 addition.
Consider a case where the registers have just been flushed and contain all zeros.
Now enter the data sequence 101 101. Table 8.6 shows the conversion of the
data sequence 101 101 into a symbol sequence in rate 1/2, K —1 Convolutional
code, the CCSDS standard.

From Table 8.6, the output symbol sequence is 24 symbols long, line 12. The
next register shift would flush the register to all zeros. In this short data stream, 24
symbols were generated for six data bits, or rate = 1/4, far short of the expected
rate 1/2. This discrepancy is caused by the short data stream. The last seven
steps were used shifting the end of the data stream out of the register. If a 10,000
bit stream were shifted through the register, a 20,007 symbol stream would have
resulted (much closer to the expected rate 1/2). Convolutional coding has no block
length; long uninterrupted data streams are desirable. It is often necessary to force
a convolutional code stream into a block structure. When this occurs, it is necessary
to append a string of zeros to the data stream to flush the registers (as was necessary
in the above example). The trailing zeros reduce the effective code rate.
In addition to the preceding representation, it is possible to represent convo-
lutional code with polynomials, state diagrams, vectors, tree diagrams, and trellis
diagrams; see, Ref. 4, pp. 315-377.
8.3.3.4 Shannon's law. Shannon's law places a theoretical limit on the
improvement in BER that can be achieved by any coding scheme. In 1949, C. E.
Shannon7 showed that there is a theoretical limit to the capacity of an error-free
channel related to the SNR and channel bandwidth:
= £log2(l+SNR) (8.2)
where C = maximum information capacity of a channel, bits/s, and B = bandwidth
of the channel, Hz.
It can be shown that for minimum energy/bit, the channel band width B should
be about equal to the transmitted bit rate R^, and this is a common design practice.
By setting Rb = B, Shannon's law can be rearranged to a more useful form:
-2- = L2 = -1.6 dB (8.3)

Eb /NQ is the energy contained in each binary digit in the communication link in
watt-seconds or joule. Eb/N0 can be reduced to a signal-to-noise ratio if bandwidth
is equal to bit rate and is a constant for a given link under fixed external conditions.
It is a fundamental measure of link performance that will be further discussed in
Chapter 9.0. In effect, Eq. (8.3) shows the theoretical limit in error reduction that
can be made by coding.
8. 3. 3. 5 Comparison of coding techniques. The fundamental function of
coding is to decrease the bit error rate of a communication channel by increasing the
symbol rate or bandwidth. In this section the error rate reduction performance and
the bandwidth of common coding schemes will be compared. Figure 8.6 compares
the BER improvement offered by coding as a function of E^/NQ. Consider a
communication link with an E^/NQ of 4 dB. If the information were sent uncoded,
the bit error rate, from Fig. 8.6, would be about 10~2. If biorthogonal block coding
or Reed-Solomon coding were used, the BER would be reduced by a factor of 10;

with convolutional coding, BER would be reduced by a factor of 1000. The price
of encoding is an increase in symbol rate to be transmitted. Table 8.7 shows the
increase in information rate produced by three coding schemes.
8.3.3.6 Concatenation. When even greater error correction is needed it
is possible to combine coding schemes, called concatenation. The CCSDS rec-
ommended concatenation scheme is made by combining convolutional code with
Reed-Solomon code, the Reed-Solomon code being the outer layer and convolu-
tional code being the inner layer. The data bits are first convolutionally coded. The
output symbol stream from the convolutional coder is Reed-Solomon coded. This
scheme provides significant increase in error protection and a significant increase
in symbol rate.
8.3.3.7 Typical spacecraft coding plan. Data storage. The data are sent
to the recorder uncoded. The onboard recorder applies coding, usually a short
Reed-Solomon, shorter than the standard (255, 223). The purpose of this code is
to protect the data from single-event upsets while in storage. The coding is removed
from the data as it is read from the recorder and the detected errors are corrected.
This process is internal to the data storage system and invisible to the operations
team. The rated capacity of a recorder is in data bits; the extra space for the code
symbols is provided beyond the rating.
Computer memory. Onboard processor memory is usually protected by a
Hamming code. Data are coded and stored, and code is removed and errors cor-
rected as data are read, similar to data storage.
Downlink. On the downlink the CCSDS coding recommendation is a long
Reed-Solomon (255, 223) for engineering and science or payload data. If the
standard Reed-Solomon code does not provide adequate error correction, it is
concatenated with convolutional rate 1/2 code, the Reed-Solomon code being the
outer layer and convolutional code being the inner layer. (Concatenation is seldom
needed for the engineering data.)
Uplink. For commands, the CCSDS coding recommendation is a BCH (63,56)
code. Decoded command words are compared to a dictionary of acceptable words;
mismatches are downlinked to MOS. In critical cases, the command sequence may
be downlinked for a bit check by the MOS team.
In summary, the CCSDS recommended coding strategy is shown in Table 8.8.

8.3.4 Multiplexing
Multiplexing (MUX) is a method by which the measurements from an entire
spacecraft can share a single communication channel. MUX is accomplished by
sharing the available time division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency division
multiplexing (FDM). The most common method, time division multiplexing is
shown in Fig. 8.7. Each measurement is sampled on a time schedule controlled by
the poll table stored in the spacecraft computer.
Each measurement is placed in sequence in the MUX memory until a data frame
is complete. The equipment that samples data measurements in sequence is called a
multiplexer or MUX; the inverse equipment is called a demultiplexer or DEMUX.
The data stream is assembled into data frames by the MUX. A major frame
usually contains the data downlinked in 1 s. Frame size is a design variable; the
frame shown in Fig. 8.8 is 64 x 16 words and contains 1024 data words (minus
overhead). Word size varies typically from 8 to 64 bits.
Each position in the major frame is called a minor frame. The minor frames
are used to subcommutate measurements. Subcommutate means to sample a mea-
surement at less than the major frame rate. A minor frame may be divided into
any number of slots; 16 are shown in Fig. 8.8. Measurements that vary slowly
are subcommutated. Measurements that vary rapidly can be supercommutated by
placing them in multiple frames. A measurement in two minor frames would be
sampled at twice the frame rate. The major frame structure can be changed for
each mission mode. For example, engine parameters would be sampled during
maneuvers but not during cruise.

Fig. 8.8 Typical major frame.
Example 8.1 Telemetry Format
Given a data transmission rate of 100,000 symbols/s and the following condi-
tions: major frame =100 minor frames, minor frame = 100 8-bit data words,
four 8-bit words in each minor frame are overhead (synchronization and space-
craft time), and 10 words in each minor frame may be subcommutated. How many
separate parameters can be measured in this format?
There are 10 x 100 = 1000 subcommutated measurements and there are 100 —
4 — 10 = 86 measurements that are not subcommutated. Therefore, the maximum
number of measurements in this format is 1086 measurements per frame.
What is the sample rate for the measurements that are not subcommutated or
supercommutated? There are 800 bits per minor frame; minor frames are transmit-
ted at a rate of 100,000/800 = 125 minor frames/s, major frames are transmitted
at a rate of 1.25 frames/s. Therefore, measurements that are not subcommutated
or supercommutated occur once per major frame, or 1.25 times/s.
How would you obtain a sample rate of 250 samples/s? Sample the parameter
twice in each minor frame = 2 x minor frame rate = 250 samples/s.
Multiple access is similar in principle to multiplexing, already discussed. MUX
is suitable for a preplanned, relatively fixed sharing of centralized resource; whereas
multiple access techniques are highly flexible in real time and are used with dis-
tributed resources. Multiple access is used with local area networks, with dis-
tributed data systems, and with, and between, communication satellites.

data systems substantially cheaper, particularly the ground-based system elements.
Standardization is also essential to multiagency projects like the Space Station. The
CCSDS standard system is called packet telemetry. Standard methods of packet
transfer between spacecraft equipment and ground equipment are being recom-
mended. The contents of the packet are entirely up to the spacecraft project. The
concept is analogous to the postal system in which the size of letters is standardized
as well as the placement of the address, the return address, the stamp and the bar
code, but the contents of the letter is entirely up to the sender.
The CCSDS standard source packet structure is shown in Fig. 8.9. The packet
primary header format is rigidly controlled so that packets can be handled by
standardized equipment. The contents of the packet data field are entirely up to
the spacecraft project. The field can be from 6 to 65542 words in length. If a
secondary header is used in the packet data fields, its presence must be noted in
the packet primary header. Spacecraft data are collected, digitized, and coded and
the standard headers prepared and attached at the front of the data stream.
The headers contain the packet number and the total number of packets in
this download. For downlink, these fixed-length packets are assigned to a virtual
channel. These blocks of data are then called virtual channel data units (VCDU).
At the ground station the packets are received, sorted into the correct order, first
to last, then routed to the correct spacecraft team using address data from the
header.
8.3.6 Data Storage
Data storage can be accomplished by two basic methods: 1) tape recorders or
2) solid-state recorders. Digital tape recorders were the industry standard until the
late 1980s when solid-state storage became available. Solid-state recorders offer
the advantage of lower mass, power, bit error rate, better temperature tolerance,
and are now the industry standard. Table 8.9 compares the characteristics of the
two forms of storage.
Solid-state recorders have power and mass advantages compared with tape
recorders, as shown in Table 8.10. The memory can be addressed in blocks of
selectable size; therefore, data can be read without tape management delays.
Bad memory locations can be programmed out of use. Large blocks of redun-
dant memory can be provided. Software can be used to detect and correct errors.
Typically the coding is added to the data as it is stored. When data are read out,
the code is used to correct any errors that have occurred and the corrected data are
forwarded to the communication system for downlink. This process is invisible to

the user and is independent of coding used to improve the downlink. The mem-
ory locations where errors occurred are recorded for downlink as engineering data.
These records are used to isolate bad memory locations. Table 8.10 summarizes the
capabilities of some currently available solid-state data recorders (SSDR). From
the table it can be deduced that a circa 2000 solid-state recorder weighs about
0.25 kg/Gbit and requires about 1 W/Gbit.
Data stored in a SSDR is protected by encoding (see Section 8.3.3). As data are
read into the recorder, parity bits are added. The encoding provides error detection
and correction for the storage period; as the data are read out of storage they are
corrected if bit flips have occurred. This whole process is invisible to the user.
A recorder rated for 10 Mbits of storage will actually store 10 Mbits plus the re-
quired number of parity bits, and 10 Mbits, cleaned and corrected, will be returned
to the spacecraft on command.

COMMAND AND DATA SYSTEM 427
8.4 Command Processing
Commands are used to change subsystem configurations, control spacecraft
activities, and to load data and instructions into computers. Commands can be
discrete or serial digital. Discrete commands can be high level power switching
(28 V) or low level logic switching (5 V). Discrete commands may be used to
start a series of events such as spacecraft release from the upper stage. A block
(or sequence) of commands are used to control a series of related events; they can
be as comprehensive as an orbit insertion burn or a complete software upload.
Commands can be real-time or stored to be executed at a given time or after a
given event.
8.4.1 Command Standardization
Command handling, like data handling, has been standardized by the CCSDS.
The standard requirements are summarized in this section. Commands are trans-
mitted in a group or command link transmission unit (CLTU) which contains all of
the individual commands or codeblocks for a major spacecraft event. For example,
a maneuver would require commands to 1) rotate the vehicle around each axis by
a certain number of degrees, 2) fire a given group of engines until a given velocity
change is achieved, 3) shut down the engines, and 4) rotate the vehicle around
each axis to return to the initial attitude. Each of these individual commands is
formatted into a codeblock. All of the codeblocks associated with the maneuver
would be compiled into a CLTU.
The CCSDS-recommended structure of a fixed-length codeblock is shown in
Fig. 8.10. The data in a codeblock are encoded with BCH (63, 56) coding. The
codeblock length is fixed for a given spacecraft; the recommended length L is
64 symbols. The first 56 bits are the command data bits, the seven parity bits are
next. One 0 filler bit is used to make the codeblock an even eight words, 64 bits,
long. The command symbol rate is 1.125 times the bit rate.
If the command is to be stored (most are) a memory address and time will be
specified. Data needed in conjunction with the command may also be specified,
and finally the execution instructions will be given. An incorrect parity bit indicates
an error in the command data; in which case a command error message is sent to
the telecommunications system. If the error cannot be corrected with certainty, the
command is dumped and retransmitted.
A CLTU is the data structure that carries any number of codeblocks in the uplink
data stream. The components of a CLTU are shown in Fig. 8.11. The start sequence
is a standard 16-bit binary synchronization pattern that announces the start point of

the CLTU. The "encoded TC Data," shown in Fig. 8.11, is any number of complete
codeblocks. The tail sequence is the same length as the codeblocks and consists
of a standard binary word repeated eight times for eight-word codeblocks.
Example 8.2 Command Message Timing
1) Given the following, how long will it take to get the message into the spacecraft
computer memory assuming no errors are made and that distance is negligible?
The size of the command CLTU is 20,000 16 bit words. The CLTU is to be
stored in the spacecraft computer.
The uplink is convolutional coded (k = 7, Rate 1/2).
There are 200 bits in the header and trailer.
The link bit error rate is 10"5.
The uplink transmission rate is 2000 symbols/s.
The number of bits in the command CLTU is 20,000 x 16 = 320,000 bits, plus
200 bits of overhead = 320,200 bits. Rate 1/2 coding increases the transmitted
information by a factor of two, thus 320,200 bits become 640,400 symbols. Trans-
mission requires 640,400/2000 = 320.2 s.
1) How much transmission time will it take to have a validated command CLTU
in the computer memory assuming the received command CLTU is transmitted to
the ground for checking and the erroneous words are retransmitted once?
640,400 x 10~5 = 6.404 erroneous words can be expected to be received by the
spacecraft, round up to seven words. The downlink of the received command will
add another seven erroneous words. Therefore, 14 words must be retransmitted.
There are (14 x 16) + 200 = 424 bits or 848 symbols in seven words.
It takes 848/2000 = 0.424 s to retransmit the erroneous words. The initial
transmission takes 320.2 s; the downlink takes 320.2 s. Therefore, it takes 320.3 +
320.2 + 0.424 = 640.824 s to establish a validated command CLTU in the space-
craft computer, ignoring the time spent by the MOS team between transmissions.
3) How long would it take to establish a validated command CLTU in the
computer memory if the spacecraft were 250 million kilometers away in Venus
orbit?
The time required for the uplink or downlink signal to travel 250 million kilo-
meters is distance divided by the speed of light in a vacuum: 250E6/3E5 =
833.333 s. The total time is
833.333 -I- 320.2 + 833.333 + 320.2 + 833.333 + 0.424 = 3140.823 s

COMMAND AND DATA SYSTEM
Ground Operations429
Fig. 8.12 Life cycle of a command.
8.4.2 Command Life Cycle
The life cycle of a command sequence, shown in Fig. 8.12, starts with prepara-
tion, review, and testing by the MOS team. Extreme care is required in preparation
and testing; command errors are difficult to find and are a leading cause of space-
craft failure. A case in point is the USSR Phobos 1, a Mars spacecraft launched
a few years ago. During cruise, a command CLTU was sent to the spacecraft and
because of a single bit error, a 0 instead of a 1, the spacecraft went into a "terminate
operations" mode, shut itself down and turned off the radio—a mode from which
there is no recovery.
Command testing is normally done on a spacecraft simulator; the degree of
simulator fidelity varies widely. A low fidelity simulator can miss errors or create
bogus alarms. A high fidelity simulator is very expensive. The best simulator is a
full-up spacecraft; even then flight simulation is not complete.
When the project is satisfied with a command sequence, it is coded (and may
be encrypted) and uplinked to the spacecraft at a low data rate. The low data rate
and coding are used to achieve a very low bit error rate; the error rate at threshold
is normally less than 10~5. A command is received by the communication system
and forwarded to CDS. The CDS system decodes it, decrypts it, and checks to
make sure it is for this spacecraft. The command is then authenticated (checked to
make sure it is really a command). Authenticity tests are very important. During
the first Magellan launch attempt, STS turned on a 10-kW rf beam carrying
digitized voice messages at a frequency near the command uplink frequency. The
Magellan command receiver locked up on the beam (digitized voice looks much
like a random number stream) and over 300 of the random word sequences were
accepted by the receiver as commands; the onboard authenticity checks rejected
them all. There are many less dramatic ways to get random command-like messages
into the spacecraft, particularly near Earth.
The common methods for authenticating a received command are 1) decoding
parity checks, 2) verifying each command word against a dictionary of accept-
able words, and 3) telemetering the command back down to the MOS team for
verification before execution, which is the ultimate check.
8.4.3 Stored Commands
Most command blocks are prepared and tested in advance and stored on-
board. For example, Magellan had a pretested emergency periapsis raise maneuver

430 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
command block stored onboard during the entire aerobraking process. At any time
the MOS team could have brought the spacecraft safely up out of the atmosphere
simply by activating that command sequence. For planetary spacecraft, with large
transmission delay times, real-time commands are essentially not possible. Authen-
tic and verified commands are stored onboard and executed based on spacecraft
time.
A portion of the CDS memory is reserved for verified, authenticated, command
storage. Commands remain in memory until use. They are protected from bit flips
by onboard coding that is removed and errors corrected when it is time to execute
the command. After execution the command memory location is reused for new
commands.
For stored commands the spacecraft clock is the critical piece of equipment
that determines when a command block is to be executed. The clock is typically
maintained as part of the CDS system. The clock meters elapsed time since a start
point just before launch, by incrementing a time number each second or fraction of
a second. It may maintain subordinate fields with smaller granularity. The Magellan
clock had four fields and four granularity levels. When the clock number is equal
to a value specified in the command uplink, the command sequence is initiated.
In addition, the spacecraft clock is used to time-stamp both science and engi-
neering data as they are taken from the instruments. These time marks are essential
to the interpretation of both types of data.
8.5 Spacecraft Computers
8.5.1 Command Sequencers to Computers
In the Sputnik/Explorer era spacecraft had only a single mode of operation;
e.g., take data and transmit it real time until something fails. In the 1960s and
early 1970s it was common for spacecraft to have several modes; the equipment
that controlled these modes worked much like the sequencer in a dishwasher and
were essentially timers for relay functions. As missions became more complicated
the sequencers developed into computers. JPL and the planetary missions led the
conversion because the communication delays over planetary distances placed a
high premium on spacecraft autonomy. For example, consider a spacecraft near
Mars. If a failure occurred, it would take 15 min for the data to arrive at Earth.
Even a simple failure with clear symptoms would take at least 1 h to respond to,
including 30 min in transmission delay. Not many failures are this patient.
In addition, the planetary missions were becoming more and more complex. The
Viking mission to Mars in the 1970s required a lander as well as an orbiter, and
the command controller, without question, had become a computer. The Viking
Command Computer was single-fault-tolerant and dual-redundant throughout.
Either computer could do the complete mission in the event of a failure. The
machine used 4K of plated wire memory, the development of which became a
major schedule risk. The memory was divided into four equal parts. The first three
could be set as read only, write, write protected, or read/write. The last IK was
always read/write. The computer used 18 bit words, 6 for operating codes and 12
for addresses. The clock issued interrupt signals every hour, second, and 10 ms,
similar to the clocks on the Mariners. With the computer came the first flight-quality
software development program for a spacecraft.

8.5.2 Central vs Distributed Computers
Up to this point, we have emphasized the computer role in the command system;
however, there is an additional and different computer job onboard a spacecraft: that
of data handling. Spacecraft data is composed of two distinct types: engineering
data that describe the performance of the spacecraft subsystems as a function of
time, and the science or payload data that are the very purpose for the existence of
the spacecraft. The data control functions are analog-to-digital conversion, en-
coding, formatting, and storing. All of these functions are ideal for computer
work.
The ideal computer for data control would feature very large memory and data
handling characteristics; modest processor speeds would be acceptable. The ideal
computer for attitude control functions would feature very high speeds, matrix
manipulation features, and modest throughput. A single computer cannot be opti-
mized for both tasks.
In the 1970s, the central main frame architecture was used, and memory was very
limited. Software was usually written in machine language to conserve memory.
The Voyager spacecraft, typical of that era, had redundant computers with 4K,
16-bit, memories. It lifted off in 1978 with approximately 30 memory locations
unused. In a modern spacecraft, distributed computers on a network are used,
memory is extensive, ever larger throughput is desired, and there is an array of high-
order languages in use. The extent and criticality of software has risen to the point
that software is often considered a separate subsystem. The Galileo spacecraft,
launched in 1989, has 18 microcomputers each with 36K, 8-bit memories.
8.5.3 Anatomy of a Computer*
All computers have four common elements, a central processing unit (CPU),
memory, clock, and bus, as shown in Fig. 8.13.
8.5.3.1 CPU. The CPU is the brain of the computer. It contains the circuitry
to access memory locations, interpret instructions, implement instructions, and
perform logic functions. A major element of the CPU is the arithmetic logic unit
(ALU), which retrieves digital numbers from memory locations for calculations
and sends the results to memory. A fraction of 1 ms in the life of a CPU might
look like this:

register
Determine if the register is larger than the number in memory 3
If yes, send the register number to memory 3
If no, erase the number; set the register to all zeros
8.5.3.2 Floating point processor. The arithmetic unit may be either a float-
ing point processor or a fixed point processor. Floating point is a processor that
can handle additional digits describing the decimal point location. (The number
2.204 x 1012 is a floating point number.) Floating point allows a computer to
handle more complicated mathematics than a fixed point processor. Attitude con-
trol calculations require a floating point machine. A floating point processor is
generally slower than a fixed point processor.
8.5.3.3 Instruction set. An instruction set is the collection of machine lan-
guage commands that the computer recognizes; this smallest executable element
of a machine language. These instructions are digital words not readily recognized
by humans. High-order languages (BASIC, COBAL, HAL-S) have commands in
English words. When a high-order language is compiled, it is converted to machine
language.
8.5.3.4 Reduced instruction set computer (RISC). A RISC machine is
optimized for processing speed. Reducing the instruction set is one of the methods
used to increase speed. The antithesis of a RISC machine is a complete instruction
set (CISC) machine. A machine that has not reduced the instruction set for speed
is called a non-RISC or CISC, complex instruction set computer. A CISC machine
can handle complicated processes with less code at the price of reduced speed.
8.5.3.5 Bus. The bus is a high-speed parallel connection between the op-
erating elements of a computer. The number of conductors in a bus is 8, 16, 32, or
64. The parallel paths in a bus normally correspond to the register size and word
size and hence, a bus transfers all the bits in a word simultaneously. A CPU usually
has at least two buses, an address bus and a data bus. Thus, when the CPU places
an address on the address bus it is instantly presented with the memory contents
on the data bus. An internal bus is called the local bus. Specialized buses are also
used between the CPU and peripherals.
8.5.3.6 Memory. The byte is the universal unit of data storage; it is the
smallest addressable unit of storage. A byte contains eight digital bits, ones and
zeros. One byte can describe 256 different characters, letters, numbers, or punctu-
ation. In some cases a byte may contain an additional parity bit for error checking.
Computers are rated by the number of bytes of each type of memory they contain.
For example, the Magellan ACS computer contained RAM space for 32 thousand
bytes of digital data, 32K. (Note that IK of computer memory is 1024 bytes, not
1000.) One Space Shuttle computer contains RAM space for 192 million bytes of
data, often stated as "192 meg."

COMMAND AND DATA SYSTEM 433
There are numerous types of memory in a modern computer. Read only mem-
ory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM) are the oldest types; however,
numerous subtypes with various useful properties have evolved with time. The
new RHPPC603e computer, from Honeywell, has three different memory types:
128 kbytes of DRAM, 4 Mbytes EEPROM, and 128K PROM.
RAM can be read or overwritten by the CPU any number of times. RAM is
divided into sections the size of a computer byte. Each byte location has an address.
The CPU can read the byte in any RAM address or write a new byte to any address.
RAM is volatile; that is, all memory goes to zeros and is lost with a power outage.
ROM is "hard wired," cannot be overwritten, and is not destroyed by power
loss (nonvolatile). Information is permanently installed in memory when the chip
is manufactured. The primary spacecraft use of ROM is to contain the spacecraft
restart code for use after a power interruption or major failure. The main difficulty
with spacecraft ROM is that it is a long lead item. The restart steps must be specified
in great detail before the spacecraft design is well understood. These restart steps
cannot be changed after the spacecraft design is developed. For that reason, new
types of memory chips are now used for spacecraft nonvolatile memory. PROM
and EPROM devices have the same properties in use as ROM; however, data are
initially placed in memory by different methods.
DRAM (D-RAM or dynamic RAM) is the most common type of RAM, usually
consisting of a transistor and a capacitor. It must be refreshed hundreds of times
a second to retain information.9 This type of memory loses all information with a
power interruption. SDRAM or Sync DRAM is a new type of dynamic RAM with
sophisticated features that make it fast enough to be synchronized with the CPU
clock.
EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory) is a rela-
tively new memory type that can be reprogrammed in flight and is nonvolatile
for substantial time periods in the event of power loss. EEPROM can be used for
bulk memory as well as the restart functions that once required ROM. Writing to
EEPROM is slower than writing to RAM and requires a higher voltage.
Flash memory is an emerging memory technology that is nonvolatile and rewrite-
able. It can be used as bulk memory similar to EEPROM, but can be packed more
densely than EEPROM. Flash memory cannot be overwritten at the byte level;
entire blocks of memory must be overwritten at a time. A block can be 512 or
more bytes.
A computer is rated by the number of bits it can hold in its register at one
time, which is also the number of bits it can process at one time; this is called
its word size. The Viking Orbiter computer (circa 1970) was an 8-bit machine.
The RAD6000 computer (circa 2000) is a 32-bit machine. For a given clock rate
a 32-bit machine can process data at four times the rate of an 8-bit machine.
8.5.3.7 Speed. The CPU contains a quartz crystal clock that sends a stream
of timed pulses, also called the heartbeat, to the computer. The clock rate (or clock
speed) is the interval of these time pulses, usually measured in hertz. At a clock
rate of 100 MHz, 1 s is divided into 100 million equally spaced intervals, each
marked by a pulse being sent to the CPU. The clock rate for the Viking Orbiter
CPU was 100 Hz. The clock rate for a Pentium 4 CPU is 1500 MHz. A super
scalar computer can perform multiple operations during a single pulse interval.

Throughput is the speed with which a computer processes data. It is a measure
of the speed of the CPU, bus system, memory system, and the software acting
together.
Dhrystone is a benchmark program that measures the speed of a computer when
processing a standard mix of instructions. The results are in Dhry stones per second,
which is the number of times the program was executed in 1 s (Ref. 9).
Whetstone is a benchmark program that measures the speed with which a com-
puter accomplishes a standard mix of floating point instructions. Results are in
Whetstones per second. Whetstone I tests 32-bit operations. Whetstone II tests
64-bit operations.9

Technologies UT1750AR is a 16-bit RISC machine that implements the 1750 in-
struction set through am emulation ROM.10 Clementine used a 1750A variant with
a 32-bit RISC design.
Intel 80 x 86 instruction set architecture is the most pervasive in the world
today (Intel ISA). The 80386 has memory management features, prior models,
80c85, 80c86 and 80cl86 do not. The 80386EX has memory management and an
interrupt controller, watchdog timer, dynamic memory refresh, and other advanced
features.
NSSC-1, the NASA standard spacecraft computer, was developed by Goddard
Space Flight Center as part of the NASA component standardization initiative of
the 1980s. As shown in Table 8.11, it has flown on several different spacecraft,
including the Hubble Space Telescope. The rapid evolution of computer technology
defeated the standardization idea, however. The NSSC-1 is a 16-bit machine with
64 kbytes of plated wire memory.
The Mongoose V processor is a space derivative of the MIPS R 3000. It is
radiation hardened, executing at 10 mips. It has the speed necessary for attitude
control calculations and a bus structure specifically designed to serve instruments
on a local area network capable of 480 Mbytes/s. It features a 4 kbyte instruction
cache and a 2 kbyte data cache as well as floating point arithmetic capability.1l
The PowerPC family was a joint effort between IBM, Apple, and Motorola to
design a scaleable family of RISC scaleable from palmtop to main frame.10 For
space use, this architecture is manifest as the rad hardened RAD6000, RAD750,
and RHPPC processors. (The advantage of a rad-hardened version of a commercial
chip is that a wealth of software and development tools are available with the chip.)
The PowerPC family features superscalar architecture that allows simultaneous
dispatching of three independent instructions into three execution units: integer,
floating point, and branch processing units.
RAD750 from BAE Systems is a single-board computer considered the next
generation beyond the RAD6000. Its development is being sponsored by JPL.
The RAD750 is a superscaler design with 32 kbyte instruction and data caches,
256 kbytes of EEPROM and 64 Mbyte of SDRAM. Throughput is 240 mips
Dhrystone at 133 MHz.
Honey well has developed a single-board computer (SBC) adaptation of the
PowerPC architecture, RHPPC SBC. The processor has a 16-kbyte instruction
cache and a 26-kbyte data cache. It has 8 Mbyte of SRAM or 128 Mbyte DRAM and
128 kbyte PROM, each with multibit error detection and correction. Its throughput
is 222 mips (Dhrystone) at 133 MHz (Ref. 3).
This section covers only a sampling of the computers available simply to give
the reader a feel for computer performance and how it is measured. There are
numerous capable computers not discussed. Furthermore, development comes so
rapidly in this field that performance which is remarkable as I write is obsolete
as you read. Current performance will be better, sometimes substantially better,
than described here.

8.5.6 Software
The typical functions of the flight software are shown in Table 8.12. The attitude
control system has the largest share. The software determines the spacecraft attitude
(best fit) based on input from each sensor and prepares a corrective response output
to the spacecraft actuators. The software also selects alternative modes of operation.
Magellan used a reaction wheel and thruster modes of attitude correction; the mode
was chosen by software based on preset criteria. There was a special maneuver
mode for conducting a star scan that provided the input for attitude update. There
was also a software-controlled wheel unloading maneuver using thrusters.
8.5.6.1 Operating system. The operating system software is the master
control for the computer. The system contains input/output device drivers, exec-
utive software and a run-time kernel. The kernel is a permanent resident of the
computer hard wired in ROM; it is the first software to run when the computer
is turned on. Some high-order languages require a run-time kernel to perform
repetitive utility functions. The executive controls the scheduling of tasks, inter-
rupt handling, diagnostics, and memory error detect/correct. There are specialized
device drivers for each type of equipment that interfaces with the computer; for
example, the gyros and the reaction wheels. (There are device drivers in a personal
computer to control the mouse, printer, and keyboard.) Device drivers accept and

interpret input from a device and format commands for output to the device.
Typically operating system software uses 20% of the memory and timing resource.
DOS and Windows are familiar examples of operating system software for personal
computers. There are two spacecraft operating systems in common use: 1) UNIX
and 2) VMS. The operating system is not normally developed by the spacecraft
project; it is a separate software normally provided with the computer.
8.5.6.2 Fault protection. The fault protection software can vary widely in
complexity. In its simplest form it detects a failure by monitoring instrumenta-
tion parameters, then it puts the spacecraft in a safe mode and waits for ground
instructions. In its most sophisticated form it is an expert system employing mul-
tiple levels of protective action without ground operations assistance. Fault pro-
tection software is particularly important to planetary spacecraft that have large
round-trip command times.
8.5.6.3 Software development. As a result of the critical nature of flight
software and the high cost of late changes, the development process has been for-
malized in a manner analogous to hardware, as shown in Fig. 8.14. The major
phases of development are 1) requirements analysis, 2) design, 3) coding, 4) qual-
ification, 5) system level testing, and 6) operational maintenance. Flight software
is verified and validated (V&V) as well as qualified.
Verification is an internal assessment of a software product that assures that it
meets its specification and complies with conventions and standards. Verification is
largely independent of functional behavior. Validation is an independent, external
assessment of a system of software products that assures that the system meets
its functional requirements within its intended environment. Validation is largely
independent of internal structure. V&V is often performed by an organization
different from the organization that wrote the code.

It is difficult and important to test the software in all possible modes, for ex-
ample, on each side of each branching statement. One implication of the software
test program is the necessity of an adequate test bed. In all probability the flight
spacecraft schedule will not accept all of the testing required and a spacecraft
simulator will be necessary. A good spacecraft simulator is very expensive; an
inadequate simulator will miss real problems and generate unreal problems.
When software is designed, as opposed to coded, it is written in pseudo code
or diagrammed by flow chart or by Nassi-Schneiderman12 diagrams. Figure 8.15
shows the plan for a shopping trip in pseudo code, flow chart, and Nassi-
Shneiderman diagram.
The flow chart is the oldest and most common design method of the three.
Nassi-Schneiderman diagrams are particularly useful in ensuring that all cases
downstream of a decision statement are handled. These diagrams are also helpful
in dividing a software into independent modules. Pseudo code is a design tool
that portrays the functions to be coded in English sentences. Pseudo code reveals
the code structure and is useful in thinking through the software module; it can
be written faster than code because the details of syntax are not important. It is
also useful for estimating lines of code and throughput. Notice that the step from
pseudo code to Pascal, C, or Quick Basic is a small one indeed.
In the preliminary design phases, requirements are allocated to the software,
the size of the software is estimated in lines of code, and a timing analysis is
performed. These subjects are discussed in the following sections.

8.5.7 Timing Analysis
Timing analysis is used to determine if a time-critical software operation can
be completed in a given computer within the time available. The analysis is also
used in the selection of a computer. Later in the design, timing analysis is used to
track the timing margin and ultimately to determine if the software or computer
must be redesigned. The steps in the process are as follows: 1) Enumerate the
arithmetic and logic functions in the software module. 2) Determine the computer
speed for each function. 3) Calculate the elapsed time for all functions. 4) Compare
calculated and required times.
Example 8.3 Digital Filter Timing Analysis
Calculate the time required for a digital filter calculation and the timing margin
if the central processor is required to make this computation 20 times per second.
The digital filter software performs the following functions each time the filter
runs:
Number of instructions
Function Frequency Add/Sub Multiply Divide Trig
Digital filter 20/s 360 460 0 50
For the computer being used the computation speed is as follows:
Add/Sub Multiply Divide
Fixed point instructions, (is 0.9 2.7 5.7
Floating point instructions, |as 2.3 3.9 9.6
Trigonometric functions can be approximated by
Trig = 30 Add + 8 Mpy + 2 Div
= 30(2.3)+ 8(3.9)+ 2(9.6)
= 119.4 (is (floating point)
Calculate the amount of computer time used by the digital filter in 1 s if trigono-
metric functions are floating point and the remaining instructions are 50% fixed
point and 50% floating point:
Fixed point add = 360 x 0.5 x 0.9 x 20 = 3240 \LS
Fixed point multiply = 460 x 0.5 x 2.7 x 20 = 12420 ILLS
Floating point add = 360 x 0.5 x 2.3 x 20 = 8260 jis
Floating point multiply = 460 x 0.5 x 3.9 x 20 = 17940 jiis
Floating point trig = 50 x 119.4 = 5970 jis
47830 \LS
How much timing margin remains in each second? Normal engineering calculation
would show that the timing margin is 95.2%; however, computer margins are

calculated in an unusual way. When the unused capability is equal to the used
capability that is considered 100% margin:
^ /Allocation — Used\Margin = 100 —————-————V Used )
Margin = 1001 - 0.04783 \
0.04783 7= 1991%
The operation of the example digital filter requires 4.8% of the candidate com-
puter throughput. The analysis of a complete spacecraft requires an analysis, simi-
lar to the example, for each of the software functions (see Table 8.12 for functions).
The sum of the time required for all functions plus overhead would then be com-
pared with the total computer throughput.
Example 8.4 Spacecraft Computer Timing Analysis
Each function in the complete spacecraft software has been analyzed; the re-
sulting instruction mix is shown in Table 8.13. The computer is the same as that
used in the prior example.
In the early phases of the design, the time required for all of the computer
tasks should be less than half of the time available or a timing margin of 100%.
Software timing and size margin are required for four reasons, two of which are
peculiar to software: 1) software development problems, 2) uncertainties in the
estimate, 3) in the late phases of development it is much less expensive to solve
problems in software than hardware, and 4) software needs margin after liftoff
for the solution of in-flight problems. Table 9.13 shows a 113% timing margin, a

desirable condition:
An instruction mix is a tabulation of the number of instructions of each type
(floating point add/subtract, fixed point multiply, etc.) used by a given spacecraft
in a given period of time, usually one second. There are standard instruction mixes,
e.g., Dhrystone, Gibson mix, and Whetstone, with which computers are rated; thus
the computers in Table 9.11 each have a throughput that was determined with a
standard mix of instructions. If you assume that your spacecraft software will have
an instruction mix identical to the standard mix you can analyze throughput by a
simpler technique, as shown in Table 8.14.
The software load listed in Table 8.14 would fit in any computer with a through-
put greater than 87 thousand instructions per second and would have adequate
margin in any computer with a throughput greater than 180 kips, assuming a rea-
sonable match between the standard and actual instruction mix.
8.5.8 Sizing
Sizing analysis compares the expected software load size to the RAM size in the
computer under consideration. The procedure is to 1) estimate the lines of code in
the software load, 2) convert lines of code (LOG) to digital words, 3) estimate the
words of data that need to be stored in RAM, and 4) compare the software size, in
words, plus the data storage needed, to the RAM available. The LOG estimate is
also useful in estimating the cost of developing the software.
After the software is coded, the LOG estimate is a simple count of lines. However,
the LOG estimate is most valuable when the code is least understood, before the
coding is done. There are three common methods of estimating software LOG.
Similarity. Compare software functions, at the lowest level possible, to the
known size of similar, previously developed, software. For example, estimate the
Kalman filter software to be the size it was on a previous project, taking into
account the differences between the projects.
Bottoms up. Divide the software into the smallest possible modules, estimate
each, and sum the estimates. Sometimes pseudo code is used to define the modules.

Note that you could split the computational chores between an attitude control
computer and a CDS computer.
Modern computers with good speed and ample memory have greatly reduced
the criticality of timing and throughput analysis. They still must be done but it is
no longer such a critical issue.
8.5.9 Languages
A computer language is a collection of commands, functions, and statements
that are the building blocks for a body of software in that language. There are
two basic types of computer languages: 1) assembly language and 2) high-order
languages (HOLs). An assembly language instructs the computer at the most
fundamental level. Assembly language instructions correspond one to one with
computer or machine language instructions. An assembly language is unique to a
given computer. Programming in assembly language requires a detailed knowledge
of the particular computer and of the specific commands of the machine.
The advantages of assembly language are as follows: 1) The resulting code is
very compact (fewest possible lines of code). 2) The fastest throughput is achieved.
3) There is no compiling step required. The disadvantages of assembly language
are as follows: 1) Coding is difficult, error prone, time consuming and expensive.
2) The code is difficult to read, therefore, difficult to debug and maintain.
HOLs use sophisticated commands and functions called by English language
names. An experienced person finds them easy to read and debug. They require
a compiler, which is a software package compatible with the computer and the
language being used. The compiler translates source code prepared in a high-order
language into equivalent machine language code. Table 8.17 lists some common
HOLs.

Telecommunication*
9.1 Fundamentals
Communication with a spacecraft takes place over two types of links as shown
in Fig. 9.1. An uplink carries commands from a ground station to the spacecraft.
Commands are specially formatted digital streams that tell the spacecraft what to
do. They can be immediately executed or, more frequently, stored for execution
at a specified time. Usually a command upload contains instructions for a whole
timed sequence of events. For example, a normal upload for Magellan provided the
spacecraft with four days of instructions, enough for 30 orbits and 120 maneuvers.
A new upload was sent up on the third day.
A downlink carries payload (science) data, the data the spacecraft was sent to
get, and the engineering or telemetry data, which show the status of the spacecraft
subsystems. The engineering and payload data can be in the same or separate data
streams. The payload data are usually a much higher data rate than the engineering
or command links.
When a ground station is only receiving the downlink data from a spacecraft, the
communication is called one-way. When the ground system is receiving downlink
data and the spacecraft is receiving uplink data, the link is called two-way.
The communication links are also used for tracking the spacecraft by measuring
the angular position of the downlink signal, by Doppler measurements and by
ranging, or two-way Doppler.
In the first section of this chapter, the basic physics of radio communication
will be discussed. In Sections 9.2 and 9.3 the communication link is described
along with link calculations. In Section 9.4 the use of the communication link for
navigation and tracking is reviewed, Section 9.5 describes some of the aspects of
system design and performance estimation, and finally Section 9.6 describes the
ground stations that support the spacecraft.
9.1.1 Electromagnetic Waves
Radio-frequency signals are electromagnetic waves, as are x rays, gamma rays,
and light. All electromagnetic waves are generated when electric charges are ac-
celerated, that is, when an electric current is changed. Although a constant current
produces an electric field, electromagnetic radiation only occurs when current is
changed, increased, or decreased. A current that oscillates in simple harmonic mo-
tion with frequency/radiates an electromagnetic wave of the same frequency. As
the name implies, all electric fields are paired with a matching magnetic field. The

electric and magnetic field vectors are in phase and perpendicular to each other,1
as shown in Fig. 9.2.
A radio transmitter generates an oscillating current, which in turn generates
an electromagnetic wave. Conversely, the presence of electromagnetic radiation
generates an alternating current in a conductor at the radio receiver. The alternating
current in a house oscillates at 60 Hz. It is a simple matter to detect induced 60-Hz
current in any isolated conductor in the house. The attendant 60-Hz electromagnetic
radiation can also be readily detected as an audible hum on an AM radio.
A complete description of the interrelation of electric current, magnetic fields,
and electromagnetic waves is provided by Maxwell's equations2: a set of four
differential equations that form a unified theory of electromagnetic motion. The
beauty and power of Maxwell's work, the first unified theory, created a sensa-
tion that persists to today. These four equations incorporated all that was known
at the time, 1857, about electricity and magnetism. They simplify to Ampere's
theorem, Coulomb's law, Biot-Servart law, and Gauss's law. In addition, the exis-
tence of electromagnetic radiation was predicted; the existence of which was later

demonstrated by Heinrich Hertz. The theory also predicted that electromagnetic
radiation should travel at the speed of light, also later demonstrated. (It is interest-
ing that Maxwell's work has also been shown to be perfectly consistent with the
special theory of relativity, introduced by Einstein many years later.) Guglielmo
Marconi, in 1901, extended Hertz's work into a system that transmitted a message
across the Atlantic from Cornwall to Newfoundland—all from four differential
equations.
For all of the importance of Maxwell's equations, solutions to them do not come
easily. For our purpose it is sufficient to 1) consider only the electrical component
of the wave pair, 2) to assume steady-state sinusoidal variation, and 3) assume
vacuum conditions. The resulting wave motion is shown in Fig. 9.3.
In Fig. 9.3 the waveform is the projection of vector E rotating around a central
point at a phase angle 0. The fundamental relationships describing the wave motion
are

It has been shown by numerous methods that electromagnetic waves travel at
the speed of light, c, in a good dielectric such as a vacuum or dry air. In a good
conductor the propagation speed is much less; for copper it is about 400 m/s at a
frequency of 106 Hz (Ref. 3).
The electromagnetic spectrum, shown in Fig. 9.4, is astonishingly broad. Wave-
lengths can be as long as the diameter of the Earth or as short as 10~12 cm. The
spectrum is continuous; however, various frequency and wavelength ranges have
been named as shown in Fig. 9.4. Of the entire spectrum only the very narrow
wavelength range between 0.000016 to 0.000028 in. is visible to the human eye.
The radio spectrum extends from 10 kHz to 300 GHz by international agreement.
In an Atlantic City Conference in 1947, the oldest subdivision scheme, shown
in Table 9.1, was established.4
Spacecraft communication takes place in several frequency bands, which are
designated by letter as shown in Table 9.2. The letter designations date from WWII
during which they were used to conceal classified radar frequencies.
The most commonly used bands for planetary spacecraft are S and X band. Earth
orbiters, notably TDRSS, also use K and Ku bands (Ka and Ku are subset of K
band). S and X bands are divided into channels. A given spacecraft will be assigned
one or more of these channels by NASA or the U.S. Air Force.

The phase angle of an electromagnetic wave is the angle of rotation of the E
vector (see Fig. 9.3). Two waves can be described in part by the phase difference.

phases. Phase difference can be expressed in terms of time, angle, or distance,

frequency and vice versa. This frequency change is called the Doppler effect or
Doppler shift (see Fig. 9.6).
The Doppler effect is extensively used to measure spacecraft velocity relative to
the receiver. The wavelength received is altered by the relative velocity as follows:
*, = 4 + 4 (9-9)

where A,,- = the wavelength received, ft = the frequency transmitted, fr = the
frequency received, and v = relative velocity between the transmitter and receiver.

receiver is increasing and is positive when the distance is decreasing.

Doppler measurements of spacecraft signals yield spacecraft radial velocity
from the ground station and the integral gives range. These measurements are best
made with an unmodulated carrier (a simple sine wave).
9.1.4 Polarization
Polarization is a property of electromagnetic radiation describing the spatial
orientation of the field vectors. An electromagnetic wave is linearly polarized
when the electric field lies in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Fig. 9.7 Circular polarized wave.
The wave shown in Fig. 9.3 is linearly polarized in the x—y plane. The general
expression for linearly polarized wave motion is
sm(kx — cot) (9.13)
There are other types of polarization. If the end of a string is moved in a circle at
a constant speed, a wave propagates along the string such that each element in the
string moves in a circle. Such a wave is circularly polarized. Circular polarization
is shown in Fig. 9.7.
It takes two equations to describe circularly polarized motion, the first being

difference is zero, the wave is linearly polarized. If the phase difference is jr/2,
we can write

This is the equation of an ellipse; it describes elliptical polarization, of which
circular polarization is a special case. Waves can have right- or left-handed circular
or elliptical polarization. Figure 9.7 shows right circular polarization.
The transfer of power between two antennas is dependent on the polarization of
the antennas; when the polarization of the two antennas is not perfectly matched,
there are polarization losses in the transfer of radiated power.

9.1.5 Decibels
The language of communications engineers is "dB-ese." Decibels (dB) are power
ratios that work like this:
P rP \ P(dB)\— = ioL lo J
*• ref
The power reference is 1 W or 1 mW, hence, dBw and dBm.
P (dBw) = lOlog = lOlog + 30 (9.17)
The dB notation is 10 times the log to the base 10 of a ratio of two power measures.
Some examples are shown here:
, = 30 dBm
10 W= lOdB^ =40dBm
1000 W = 1 kW = 30dBw = 60dBm
Table 9.3 shows some power ratios and equivalent dBs to give you a feel for
how they work.
The use of dBs dates back to the time when link calculations were made with
logarithms or mechanical desk calculators. In that era, accurate multiplication was
substantially more difficult than addition or subtraction. By using dBs, multipli-
cation becomes addition of the equivalent dBs. This advantage disappeared when
hand-held computers arrived, but the use of dBs is an entrenched custom.

9.1.6 Modulation
Modulation is a process by which a signal is used to vary a characteristic of the
carrier wave. The signal contains the data to be transmitted; it is usually a relatively
low frequency or digital. Consider the carrier as a pure tone of say, 3 GHz, for
example. If you were to quickly turn this off and on at a rate of a thousand times
a second, we would say the carrier is being modulated with a frequency of 1 kHz.
Turning the carrier off and on would be disastrous to a spacecraft, but changing, or
modulating, the amplitude or phase would be acceptable. Spacecraft carrier signals
are modulated by shifting the carrier phase slightly at a given rate. One scheme is
to modulate the carrier with a frequency, for example, near 1 MHz. This 1-MHz
modulation is called a subcarrier. The subcarrier is in turn modulated to carry
individual phase shifts that are designated to represent groups of binary ones and
zeros — the spacecraft's telemetry or command data. The amount of phase shift
used in modulating data onto the subcarrier is referred to as the modulation index
and is measured in degrees.
Demodulation is the process of detecting the subcarrier and processing it sepa-
rately from the carrier, detecting the individual binary phase shifts, and decoding
them into digital data for further processing. The same processes of modulation
and demodulation are used commonly with Earth-based computer systems and fax
machines transmitting data back and forth over a telephone line. The device used

for this is called a modem, short for modulator-demodulator. Modems use an audio
frequency carrier that the telephone system can readily handle.
The carrier frequency is a sinusoidal wave of a frequency selected for good
transmission. For example, an FM radio transmitter would use a carrier frequency
of about 100 MHz, and it would transmit signals in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz
(music). The 100-MHz signal is modulated at 20 to 20,000 Hz. Why modulate?
The aperture of an effective antenna should be at least as large as the wavelength
of the signal. The wave length is A = c/f, where c is the speed of light or about
3 x 108 m/s. An antenna to receive 20 Hz would be 15,000,000 m, or 9000 miles,
in diameter; for 20,000 Hz the diameter would be 15,000 m or 9 miles! In other
words, out of the question. If you modulate a 100-MHz carrier, the antenna size
comes down to the 3-m diameter.
The sinusoidal carrier wave C is characterized by amplitude, phase, and fre-
quency as follows:
C = A cos(/f + 0) (9.22)
where A is the amplitude, / is the frequency, t is time, and 0 is the phase. Frequency,
phase, and amplitude can be varied as a function of time in proportion to amplitude
of the signal.
9.1.6.1 Analog data. Figure 9.8 shows the two most common methods of
modulating an analog chanel. In amplitude modulation (AM) the amplitude of the
carrier wave is proportional to the amplitude of the signal. In frequency or phase
modulation (FM or PM) the frequency or phase of the carrier is proportional to
the amplitude of the signal. Spacecraft use FM or PM because the transmitter
can be operated at maximum power and highest power efficiency. FM and PM
systems can also operate at a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than AM systems;
however, these systems have a nonlinear response to weak signals.5 Performance
is relatively independent of signal strength until a threshold value is reached below
which performance drops rapidly. This effect can be observed as you drive away
from an FM station; radio performance is reasonably independent of distance until
the link is suddenly lost altogether. AM systems do not exhibit this behavior; they
require a greater SNR and degrade gracefully as SNR is reduced.

9.1.6.2 Digital data. Amplitude, frequency, and phase modulation tech-
niques can also be used to transmit digital data. Since about 1970, spacecraft have
used digital modulation or pulse code modulation (PCM) exclusively. A major
advantage of digital data and digital modulation is that the bit error rate can be
substantially reduced by coding techniques. The use of digital computers for data
management makes digitizing the data essential in any case. Figure 9.9 shows the
most common digital modulation methods.
Binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is done by setting the carrier phase to 0 deg
to transmit a binary zero and shifting the phase to 180 deg to transmit a binary one
as shown in Fig. 9.9.
Binary frequency shift keying (BFSK) switches between two frequencies distinct
from the carrier frequency.

<<<PAGE 471>>>

TELECOMMUNICATION 459
Binary amplitude shift keying (BASK) shifts between two amplitudes; however,
it is seldom used in spacecraft digital communication. It is interesting to note that
Morse code is a form of BASK.
The most common method of modulating a spacecraft communication carrier
frequency is phase-shift keying. Shifting between two phases, 0 and 180 deg, is
shown in Fig. 9.9; however, phase can be shifted in any number of steps (M-ary
PSK). With quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) there are four phase states
to which the carrier can be set, representing the symbols 11, 10, 01, and 00.
The advantage of QPSK over BPSK is that, for a given bit error rate it requires
only half the bandwidth. Higher orders of shift keying such as 8PSK are also
used infrequently. The required bandwidth of 8PSK is only one-half of that for
QPSK; however, the phase states are closer together and harder for the receiver to
distinguish, resulting in a higher bit error rate for a given power level.
9.2 Communication Links
A communication link consists of a set of transmitting equipment, receiving
equipment, and the rf link between them. In this section we will discuss the
elements of a link starting with the spacecraft transmitter, which first modulates
the subcarrier then modulates the carrier. Then we will discuss the elements of the
ground station receiver.
9.2.1 Transmitter Subcarrier Modulation
The first stage of the transmitter uses the binary data bits to modulate the subcar-
rier; Fig. 9.10 shows the steps in this process. As shown in Fig. 9.10, the input to the
subcarrier modulator is a digital bit stream, and the output is a modulated subcar-
rier, which, in the frequency domain, has a spectrum of the sin x/x type. Data are
gathered from all over the spacecraft, from payload sensors and from engineering

generated by the signal generator and modulated in response to the signal stream.
Encoded data symbols are used to modulate the subcarrier. The subcarrier fre-
quency and wave form are set by the subcarrier signal generator. The subcarrier
frequency is controlled by any of several types of oscillator. The wave form can
be either square wave or sinusoidal.
9.2.2 Transmitter Carrier Modulation
The second stage of the transmitter uses a subcarrier to modulate the carrier;
Fig. 9.11 shows the steps in this process.
9.2.2.1 Carrier signal generation. The carrier is a pure sine wave gener-
ated at a precise frequency. Most spacecraft and all planetary spacecraft generate
this frequency in two ways: 1) by reference to the spacecraft oscillator or 2) by
generating a downlink that is phase coherent with an uplink signal being received.
Phase coherence means that the downlink carrier phase is synchronous with the re-
ceived phase of the uplink carrier. This process is called two-way coherent mode.
In this mode the downlink frequency is controlled at a fixed ratio to the uplink
frequency being received. The equipment that does this is called a transponder.
Some of the transponder turnaround ratios required to communicate with three
major ground station networks are shown in Table 9.4.
The two-way coherent mode allows the ground station to measure two-way
Doppler and to track the spacecraft frequency more precisely. The ground station
may insert a pseudorandom PN code or tones or both into the uplink for ranging.
From the turnaround time of the ranging code, the MOS team can determine
spacecraft range very accurately.

The output power spectrum of a carrier phase modulator is shown in Fig. 9.1 1.
The center frequency is the carrier frequency; it is a pure sine wave, which produces
a spectral line. The phase modulation process has produced two sinx/x spectra
spaced at ±fs , about the carrier frequency, where fs is the subcarrier frequency. The
amount of energy in the carrier spectral line can be controlled by the transmitter.
It is desirable to retain transmitted energy in the carrier in order to facilitate signal
acquisition and Doppler measurements.
9.2.2.2 Power amplifier. The signal from the carrier phase modulator is too
weak for transmission; after the wave is shaped, power amplification is required.
There are two basic types of power amplifiers: solid-state and traveling-wave tube
amplifiers (TWTA). TWTAs have been in use longer and have less technology risk;
however, their design and construction is still somewhat empirical. In addition, they
produce more rf power output at higher efficiency. Solid-state amplifiers tend to
be smaller, lighter, and require less power.
The output of the power amplifier is filtered to remove frequencies outside the
bandwidth of interest and passed to the antenna for transmission.
9.2.2.3 Antennas. Antennas are generally categorized as omnidirectional
("omni") or directional. Directional antennas focus the radiated power into a
beamwidth of a few tenths of a degree to several tens of degrees and come in
a variety of types. The beamwidth 0 is the angle between the half power points
(3 dB down) relative to the boresight power. Antenna pattern measurement param-
eters are shown in Fig. 9.12.
An ideal isotropic antenna would distribute radiated energy evenly over
the surface of a sphere of 4jr steradians (square radians) or 41,253 square
degrees. The product of gain and field of view for a perfect antenna is always
41,253:
G0= 41,253 (9.23)
Real antennas are not this efficient; a good rule of thumb for broad-beam antennas
is
G = (9.24)(90

where 0 and 0 are the height and width of the beam in degrees. Expressing Eq. (24)
in decibels yields

where A = area of antenna aperture and 77 = antenna efficiency.
Antenna efficiency is a function of feed blockage, spill-over loss, aperture illu-
mination, and transmission line loss. The product rjA is called the effective area
Ae. For a parabolic antenna with an efficiency of 55%, Eq. (26) can be reduced to
a more convenient dB form:

Parabolic antennas are the best selection when a narrow beam is required. The
usual feed arrangement is a wave guide running through or around the reflec-
tor to the focus of the parabola. In a Cassegrain feed design a horn feeds the
subreflector, which is shaped to spread the beam over the face of the parabolic
reflector with the resulting high gain on the boresight. The subreflector and sup-
port truss block some of the beam and scatter power into the side lobes; this
loss is on the order of 1.5 dB (Ref. 7). This loss can be avoided by an offset
feed.
Horn antennas can provide full Earth coverage for frequencies above C-band.
In its simplest form this system is fed by a waveguide, which is flared at the end
to supply the desired aperture.
Helical antennas or end-fire antennas are preferred for S-band medium-gain
antennas. For example, NAVSTAR uses helix antennas at 1.5 GHz to provide full
Earth coverage from an altitude of 16,000 km.8 They are used for rather wide
beams and gains about 14 dB or less. Antenna output must be circular polarized.
If the polarization of the transmitter and receiver do not match exactly, there will
be a polarization loss; Table 9.6 shows polarization losses associated with a polar-
ization mismatch.
Phased arrays provide gain by exciting many separate radiating elements,
each of which has no directive properties. The combination can, however, have
a very narrow beam when the elemental beams interact constructively and de-
structively. The beam can be steered by controlling the phase of each element.
The advantages of this arrangement are that one array can produce a large
number of beams simultaneously, and these can be steered electronically over
wide angles without mechanical equipment. In addition the array can be mounted
rigidly to structure. The major disadvantage is the complexity and number of
amplifier units. The number of elements to be controlled can be several
hundred.8
Polarization antenna output can be polarized. Most space applications use cir-
cular polarization. If polarization of transmitter and receiver do not match exactly,
there will be a polarization loss, which can be large (see Table 9.6).
Antennas with like polarization have a small polarization loss, about 0.05 dB, as
a result of imperfect matching. It is desirable to maintain antenna figure control,
the figure departure from ideal, to within 1 /20th of a wavelength. For large antennas
and high frequencies this requirement can be very demanding.

9.2.3 Ground Receiver
The ground station receiver is not particularly constrained by power and weight
considerations. As a result, the ground stations can be depended upon to provide
most of the gain in a link as we will discuss later. Figure 9.14 shows the block
diagram of a ground station; it is based on a Deep Space Network (DSN) station,
but the functions are generally applicable.
9.2.3.1 Phase lock. A receiver, either spacecraft or ground, locks onto a
signal using a phase lock loop circuit, which combines a voltage oscillator and a
phase comparator designed so that the oscillator tracks the phase of the incoming
signal. When this is achieved, it is common to refer to the receiver as "locked"
or "in lock." When a receiver is in lock, the communication link is complete, and
data can be transferred. When lock is lost, the data flow is interrupted, and bits are
lost. The lost bits are not normally recoverable.
9.2.3.2 Maser. The rf wave is brought from the antenna, over as short
a span as possible, to the low noise maser. The maser has the lowest noise
figure of any type of preamplifier. (Maser stands for microwave amplification
by stimulated emission radiation.) Its operation is similar to that of a laser except
it operates at microwave frequencies. The maser is maintained at liquid helium
(or liquid nitrogen) temperatures. The output energy comes from unstable electrons
at high energy level stimulated by the signal to release energy in transit to a stable
level.
9.2.3.3 Oscillators. The carrier frequency is provided by an oscillator.
Spacecraft timing standard is typically a crystal oscillator, which consists of a

quartz crystal coupled to an active amplifier. The vibrating crystal is coupled to
the circuit by the piezoelectric effect, whereby stress in a crystal creates charges
on its faces. The Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, Laurel,
Maryland, has developed a spacecraft ultra-stable oscillator (USO) with an output
frequency of 19.14 MHz, which can be multiplied up to the frequencies the space-
craft requires. The frequency stability is better than 2 x 10~13 for integration times
in the range of 1000 s. After a 25-day temperature stabilizing period the USO is
expected to have a daily aging rate of 2 x 10~10 and a long-term frequency change
of less than 1 x 10~6 over five years.
The ground station reference is typically a hydrogen maser standard with bet-
ter stability than the USO. At the DSN stations this frequency is provided by a
temperature-controlled hydrogen-maser-based frequency standard. The stability
of the DSN hydrogen masers is ±1 s in 30 million years. The masers also control
the DSN master clocks, which distribute universal time.
9.3 Link Design
The object of a link design is to determine if the transmitted power of a given
design is adequate to successfully transfer the desired data rate. The link is evalu-
ated by systematic tabulation of gains and losses to arrive at the transmitted power
for a given symbol rate, range, and losses. The steps in this process are as follows:
1) estimate the data rate, 2) select the maximum bit error rate (usually specified
by customer), 3) select frequency (usually specified by customer), 4) select mod-
ulation and coding (usually specified by customer), 5) estimate the symbol rate,
6) set transmitter power, 7) set antenna gains, 8) estimate system gains and losses,
9) calculate receiver noise, and 10) prepare a link table for each link. In this section
each of these steps will be discussed along with examples.

transmitter power. The receiver responds to power density and is indifferent to how
it is achieved. The product is called effective isotopic radiated power (EIRP):
EIRP=P,G, (9.29)
Example 9.1 EIRP Optimization
The purpose of this example is to illustrate the trade between antenna size and
power required, based on weight. Other factors, such as attitude control interac-
tions, are ignored for the present purposes.
Consider a spacecraft transmitting system operating at a frequency of 8.4 GHz.
The antenna system and the part of the power supply related to the telecommuni-
cation system is allocated a total weight of 150 Ib.
It is desired to achieve a maximum EIRP within this weight limit. The spacecraft
antenna is a parabolic reflector. An analysis of the weight Wa of this type of antenna
yields the following relation:
Wa = Ca + 2D2
where Ca is a constant, D is the diameter of the antenna in feet, and Wa is the antenna
weight in pounds. Similarly, the power supply weight Wp can be approximated as
where Cp is a constant and Pt is transmitted power in watts. The sum of Ca and
Cp is 40 Ib, and the efficiency of the antenna is 65%. (In practice, simple analytic
expressions for weight can be inadequate. Indeed the design may require choices
among existing components, leading to discontinuous relationships.)
Find the maximum EIRP and the corresponding antenna diameter and transmit-
ted power.
The design constraint is
Wa + Wp = Ca + 2D2 + Cp + 0.5Pt = 150 Ib
2D2 + 0.5Pt = HOlb
Pt = 220 - 4D2
The problem is to maximize EIRP under this constraint. From Eq. (9.24) the
antenna gain is
Gt = rj(
X = c/f = 3 x 108/(8.4 x 109) = 0.0357m = 0.117ft
EIRP = PtGt = (0.65) (220 - 4£>2) (jr£>/0.117)2
Setting the derivative of EIRP with respect to D equal to zero, the value of D for
maximum EIRP is
D = 5.244 ft
The corresponding value of transmitted power is found to be
Pt = 22Q-4D2 = HOW

and the maximum EIRP is
EIRPmax = 110(0.65)(5.2447r/0.117) = 1.42 x 106W
or
10 log(1.42 x 106) + 30 = 91.52dBm
9.3.2 Free Space Path Loss
The power at a receiver is

where Pr = received power at the antenna terminals, W; Ar = effective area of
the receiving antenna, commonly called the capture area, m2; and Gr — gain of
the receiving antenna, and
p f (~* i ^
(9.32)
The power loss reflected in Eq. (9.32) is caused entirely by the distance between
the two antennas. This loss is called the free space path loss or just path loss. It
is not caused by absorption; it is caused by increasing spherical surface area as
radius increases. Path loss Lp is
Lp = (4n^2R (9.33)
And because A = c//, then
(4n)2R2f2Lp = ^2 J (9.34)
Path loss is more conveniently expressed in decibels:
LP = 201og(4;r) + 201og(103) + 201og(fl) + 201og(109)
+ 20 log(/) - 20 log(3 x 108) (9.35)
Lp = 92.44 + 20 log(fl) + 20 log(/) (9.36)
where Lp = path loss, dB; R = radius or range, km; and / = frequency, GHz; or
Lp = 36.6 + 20 log (/) + 20 log(fl) (9.37)
where R = range, statute miles and / = frequency, MHz. Path loss is clearly a
major driver in a planetary link design and is significant in geosynchronous link
design. Note the units you must use with Eq. (9.36) and (9.37). Power received is

9.3.3 Noise
Signal power is always received along with unwanted noise. Noise degrades the
ability to correctly interpret the signal. The smaller the SNR, the more difficult
it is to segregate the signal. Thus the SNR is the key measure of the quality of a
communication link.
The principle sources of noise are 1) cosmic noise, which comes from all of
the bodies in the universe; 2) atmospheric noise from rain, fog, and lightening;
3) man-made noise of all kinds from electric motors, spark plugs, neon lights, and
the like; and 4) thermal noise in all electronic devices, called Johnson noise.
9.3.3.1 Effective noise temperature. Most noise is generated by the ther-
mal state of matter; all bodies at a temperature higher than 0 K emit thermal noise
for which the noise power is given by
Pn = (9.39)
where
Pn = noise power, W
k = Boltzman constant, 1.38 x 10~23 W-s/K
B = noise bandwidth interval, Hz
Te = effective noise temperature, deg K
[Note that Eq. (9.39) cannot be used to calculate noise power in optical links;
thermal noise is secondary in optical systems.]
If the noise source is thermal, the effective temperature will be the thermody-
namic temperature of the body. However, regardless of the noise source, it can be
treated as thermally induced by calculation of an effective noise temperature. If
thermal noise produced in different devices is uncorrelated, it can be summed on a
power basis. For example, the effective thermal noise of an antenna can be added
directly to the effective noise of a receiver. A noisy amplifier can be represented by
an ideal noiseless amplifier and an effective noise temperature input (see Fig. 9.15).
If the device is purely passive, such as a transmission line, the effective input
temperature rei will be a function of the thermodynamic temperature Tt of the
device and the loss in the device L. Assuming the thermodynamic temperature of
the device is 290 K, a common assumption,
where TQ} is measured at the input of the device. The equivalent temperature of the
device measured at the output Teo is

9.3.3.2 Noise figure. The noise figure is used to measure the noise induced
by a real electronic device compared with an ideal device. For a linear electronic
device (a two-port device), the noise figure F is defined as
F =(SNR)in
(SNR)out(9.42)
For an ideal noiseless device the SNR will be unchanged by the device. Any noise
present at the input would be amplified by the gain, G, as would the signal, and
the ratio would not change. The noise figure for an ideal device is 1. Remembering
that Pni = kTB and that S0/Si = G, Eq. (9.42) can be rewritten as

The effective cable temperature includes the contribution of any passive compo-
nents between the antenna and the receiver amplifier, typically transmission cable,
and a bandpass filter. The effective cable temperature is computed as a simple
resistor.
The effective antenna temperature includes contributions of cosmic noise,
weather noise, Earth noise if the Earth is in view, man-made noise, and warm-
body emission. In short, the antenna noise includes all external effects plus thermal
noise internal to the antenna. Figure 9.17 shows antenna temperatures for ground
antennas pointed upward at various angles.

The receiver effective temperature is computed from its noise figure, measured
at the input,
re = 7b(F-l) (9.47)

the receiver input yields the receiver system noise temperature:

Ts — effective system temperature, K

System noise temperatures are often referenced to the antenna terminals; dif-
ferent reference points lead to equivalent but numerically different effective
temperatures.

What is the system noise temperature of a spacecraft receiver with the following
characteristics:
Antenna temperature Ta = 90 K

The probability of a bit error is a function of the efficiency of coding. This subject
is covered in Chapter 8, in the coding section.
9.3.7 Modulation Index
After modulation some of the transmitted power is present in the carrier and
some in the data; the power distribution is shown in Fig. 9.18 in the frequency
domain.
The carrier is transmitted as a single frequency /c, the center frequency in
Fig. 9.18. The data are transmitted in two spectra, or lobes, centered about the
carrier frequency. The center of the data spectra is at the carrier frequency ±
the subcarrier frequency fs. The power distribution between the carrier and the

The modulation index is the parameter by which this distribution is described. The
carrier represents a power loss to the data channel and vice versa. For a channel

The solution to these equations is plotted in terms of modulation loss in Fig. 9.19,
for sinusoidal and square- wave subcarriers.
The power in the carrier assists the receiving station in locking onto the channel.
Lock-up is particularly demanding for a planetary link because of the distance and
relative velocities involved. In a link analysis it is necessary to provide adequate
data channel margin and adequate carrier margin.

9.3.9 Atmospheric Attenuation
Figure 9.20 shows the one-way vertical attenuation of the atmosphere without
the effect of rain or fog.
Atmospheric attenuation is essentially zero from 0.5 to 5 GHz, which explains
the popularity of this frequency range (S-band). Figure 9.20 is for vertical transmis-
sion. The losses increase at lower angles as a result of the increase in atmosphere
traversed; the atmospheric losses at 10 deg are about 3 dB higher than zenith.
At frequencies above 3 GHz, the presence of rain can substantially increase
atmospheric attenuation.

Rain, sufficiently heavy, can overwhelm any communication link above about
5 GHz (see Gordon,10 p. 179). One approach is to design the link with adequate
margin, without rain, and to accept data loss if the atmospheric water exceeds the
available margin.
9.3.10 Link Tables
A link table is a systematic method of recording the gain, loss, and tolerance
data for a link. To build a link table, it is convenient to convert the link equation
to decibels:
228.6 - 10 log(7;) - 101og(/?5) (9.62)
where 228.6 dB is the Boltzmann constant and Ts = system noise temperature, K,
and Rs = symbol rate, sps.

Example 9.3 Link Table
In the following example we will construct the high-rate downlink table for the
Magellan spacecraft. This is one of 13 telecommunication links that Magellan used.
More data were transmitted over this link than the data from all prior planetary
programs combined. The link connects the Magellan high-gain antenna and any
one of the DSN 70-m ground antennas. The link parameters are shown in Table 9.7.
The detailed steps in creating a link table follow the link from the transmitter
through each gain and each loss down the link through the receiver. We will take
each of these steps for the Magellan-high rate telemetry link.

6) Calculate cable loss, transmitter to antenna (measured): —0.06 dB
(Magellan cable loss is unusually low because the transmitter is only a few
inches from the feed.)
7) Calculate the transmitting antenna gain [diameter = 3.658 m (given), and
peak gain using Eq. (9.27)]:
Gt = 17.8 + 201og(3.658) + 201og(8.425) = 47.57 dB
(Actual measured gain was 48.8 dB): +48.8 dB
8) Calculate EIRP = 5 + 6 + 7: 62.06 dB

The preceding link table is for nominal conditions. In practice there would be a
worst-case and a best-case table for each link.
Link tables are ideal subjects for computer spreadsheets. The Magellan link table
for one of the S-band uplinks is shown in Table 9.8.
9.3.11 Conjunctions
Planetary conjunctions cause a unique communication hazard. A conjunction
occurs when the Earth, sun, and a planet are aligned as shown in Fig. 9.21.
At superior conjunction the Earth and planet are diametrically opposed; the
maximum communication distance occurs at superior conjunction. At inferior
conjunction the planets are at their minimum range. Communication is impossible
within about 3 deg of alignment for a superior conjunction with an outer planet or
any conjunction with an inner planet. The link margin for Magellan at the superior
conjunction of 1990 is shown in Fig. 9.22.
A planetary spacecraft must be entirely self-sufficient during a conjunction.
Communication of any kind is impossible. Engineering data are stored at a low
rate during the period and played back after the conjunction.
9.3.12 Optical Systems
Optical transmission powered by narrow-beamed lasers has major potential for
communications. The amount of data that can be modulated onto a carrier is directly
proportional to carrier frequency. Because of the extremely high frequencies gen-
erated by lasers, they have enormous potential capacity to carry information. They
have not been used for spacecraft communication because of high absorption by
water vapor in the atmosphere. Recent advances in satellite constellations (Iridium
et al.) have introduced a need for intersatellite links (ISLs).16 For ISLs operating
at symbol rates greater than 100 msps, laser links are lighter than conventional

ditional advantage that frequencies are not yet controlled and allocated. A laser
communication link is shown schematically in Fig. 9.23.
The first civil high-data-rate optical communications system developed by ESA
was launched in 1998 on the SPOT-4 Earth resources satellite. This system, called
SILEX (Semiconductor Intersatellite Link Experiment), will transmit image data
from Spot-4 to the French ARTEMIS geosynchronous satellite (launch 2002) then
down to a ground-based data-processing center near Toulouse. The advantage of
this double hop is that ARTEMIS, in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), is in view of
the SPOT-4, in low Earth orbit (LEO), for a much longer period than any Earth
station. In turn ARTEMIS is always in view of Toulouse. The result is an almost
continuous data stream from a spacecraft in LEO to a single ground station. SILEX
will also be used for experiments with the Japanese OICETS satellite.

482 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
The SILEX transmits 50 Mbps at a wavelength of 800 to 860 nm. The light
source is a solid-state GaAlAs laser diode operated typically at 60 mW optical
power. The modulation scheme is on/off switching. The optical data detector is a
photodiode. To concentrate the optical beam in the direction of the partner satellite,
the light is transmitted via a 25-cm aperture telescope providing a beamwidth of
only 10 microrad (0.000057 deg). In the SPOT-4 configuration where the partner
spacecraft is the order of 40,000 km away, the light travel time is about 0.17 s.
During this period, the partner moves about 1000 m, whereas the beamwidth is
only about 300 m; consequently, extremely tight beam pointing is required.16
9.4 Communication System Design
9.4.1 Magellan Communication System Example
The Magellan communication system is unusual in two ways: 1) the system
operates at S-band and X-band, and 2) the high-gain antenna is time shared with
the radar system. During a portion of each mapping orbit, the antenna is pointed
downward and is used for radar data taking. During most of the remainder of the
orbit, the antenna is pointed at Earth for data downlink. Two frequency bands were
required to accommodate the S-band radar and a high data rate on X-band. The
spacecraft has three major communication modes: cruise mode, mapping mode,
and emergency mode. The links and data rates are shown in Fig. 9.24 and Table 9.9.
The science data, with engineering data interleaved, can be transmitted 268.2
kbps over the high-gain antenna (HGA) to the 70-m DSN stations. At this data rate
an entire mapping pass is transmitted to ground every orbit. Normal commanding
was done at S-band via the medium-gain antenna. In an emergency situation where

attitude control is lost, commands can be uplinked to Magellan via the low-gain
antenna at rates as low as 7.8 bps. Emergency engineering is downlinked over the
MGA at 40 bps. Commands are normally uplinked at 62.5 bps, over X- or S-band.
If commands are received at X-band, they are downconverted to S-band before
they are forwarded to the command and data system The medium-gain antenna
(MGA) is a conical body fixed horn, which transmits engineering data and receives
commands at S-band. Spacecraft maneuvering is not required to point the antenna
during the primary mission.
The Magellan communications system block diagram is shown in Fig. 9.25. The
system is completely redundant and cross strapped. It can receive modulated or
unmodulated uplink carrier over the S/X band high gain antenna.
The NASA standard deep-space transponders can use S-band uplink carrier to
coherently excite the downlink at either S- or X-band. The transmit/receive ratios
are 240/221 and 880/221 (two-way tracking). The X-band uplink can be coherently
down converted to downlink at S- or X-band; the transmit/receive ratios for this
mode are 240/749 and 880/749 (two-way coherent). With no uplink, the downlink
frequency is derived from the spacecraft oscillator. The transponder uses redundant
22 w TWTAs in X-band and 5-W solid-state amplifiers at S-band.
The transmitter downlink path is as follows. Working from point A in Fig. 9.25,
two digital bit streams enter the control unit and are forwarded to the transponder.
One enters from data storage or real time from the payload. The other stream comes
from the command and data handling system with telemetry on engineering status.
The data streams are modulated onto subcarriers, which are in turn modulated onto
the carrier output. If the transponder is in the two-way coherent mode, the downlink
carrier frequency is controlled at a fixed ratio to the frequency of the uplink carrier

being received. In noncoherent mode the downlink frequency is controlled by
reference to the spacecraft oscillator. The composite signal is then routed out of
the transponder through a transmit select switch. If transmission is to occur over
X-band, the signal is sent to the TWTA for amplification; if the transmission is
to occur over S-band, it is sent a solid-state amplifier. The signal is then filtered
to reduce second- and higher-order harmonics from the signal. From the filter the
composite signal travels through a diplexer and finally to the selected antenna
where it radiates to a ground station. The diplexer allows a transmitter and receiver
to share the same antenna. It also isolates the transmitter from the receiver port at

the receiver's frequency so that the transmitter does not lock, jam, or damage the
receiver.
The receiver's uplink path is as follows. The ground station modulates a digital
command onto a subcarrier and further modulates the subcarrier onto the uplink
carrier frequency to form a composite uplink signal. The composite signal enters
the subsystem through the antenna to the receiver select switch, which then se-
lects transponder A or B. The composite signal travels through the transponders
low-pass filter, which rejects unwanted transmitter harmonics and frequency spurs
that might exist above the diplexer's stop band. The signal then moves into the
transponder's receiver, which demodulates it and forwards the data plus a receiver-
in-lock indication to the command, and data subsystem, which validates and pro-
cesses the command. There was no physical way to turn off the command receiver.
In two-way coherent mode, ranging tones, or code, are demodulated in the re-
ceiver and sent to the transmitter for turnaround and modulation into the downlink
signal.
The system accepts recorded data from CDS at 268.8 or 115.2 bps. The data is
K = 6, rate ^, convolutionally coded, and biphase modulated onto the subcarrier.
The subcarrier signal phase modulates either X- or S-band carrier. The maximum
bit error rate is 1 x 10~3 for downlink and 1 x 10~5 for command uplink.
9.4.2 Subsystem Interfaces
The communications system interfaces with every subsystem on the space-
craft except propulsion. The power system interface is influenced by the trade
studies made between transmitter power and antenna gain. The attitude control
system will limit the stability the HGA can expect. If greater accuracy is required,
closed-loop tracking can be incorporated in the communication system. There are
two kinds in use: monopulse and conical scan tracking. With either selection an-
tenna alignment is improved at the expense of a more complicated communication
system. The power system will be the recipient of requirements for power and
special power conditioning. The rf power selected will be a significant impact to
the power system. The structural arrangement will need to provide unobstructed
field of view and accurate alignment. The CDS system interacts with data rate, data
storage, and coding options. CDS and communications systems are so tightly re-
lated that for the first 20 years of the space program they were considered to be one
system.
9.4.3 Traveling-Wave Tube Amplifiers
One of the difficult areas in a communication system design is rf power amplifi-
cation. The older method is the use of a TWTA (see Fig. 9.26). In a traveling wave
tube an electron beam interacts continually with an RF wave circulating around
the beam for a distance long in comparison to wavelength. The interaction is such
that rf power is increased substantially at the expense of electron beam energy.
Radio frequency output can increase 20 to 60 dB.
TWTAs require voltages that are not available from the spacecraft power system,
— 1000 V, +5000 V, etc. As a result, each TWTA comes with a power supply
designed to match what the TWTA needs. (TWTA normally means the tube and

power supply; TWT normally means the tube only.) The overall rf to dc power
efficiency of a TWTA (including power supply) is usually between 25 and 35%; it
is less for solid-state devices. The overall power efficiency of the Magellan TWTA
was 33%. Figure 9.27 shows TWTA input power and mass as a function of output
power based on nine spacecraft TWTAs. The mass includes the amplifier as well
as the traveling-wave tube.

9.4.4 Solid-State Power Amplifiers
A newer, potentially more reliable and lighter method of rf amplification is
emerging in the solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), which accomplishes the same
rf amplification as a TWTA. Solid-state power amplifiers have fewer failure modes,
lower weight, and high voltage is not required; thus, the high voltage power supply
is eliminated.
SSPAs have been developed from L-band through K-band. The performance of
some SSPAs is shown in Table 9.10.
9.4.5 Transponders
A transponder is a form of repeater that generates a downlink carrier, which
is 1) in phase with an uplink signal and 2) at a frequency, which is an exact
multiplier of the uplink signal. For example, the Magellan transponder can use
S-band uplink carrier to excite the downlink coherently at either S- or X-band.
The transmit/receive ratios are 240/221 and 880/221 (two-way tracking). The X-
band uplink can be coherently downconverted to downlink at S- or X-band; the
transmit/receive ratios for this mode are 240/749 and 880/749 (two-way coherent).
With no uplink the downlink frequency is derived from the spacecraft oscillator.
The transponder used redundant 22-W TWTAs in X-band and 5-W solid-state
amplifiers at S-band.
The newer Small Deep Space Transponder,13 which flew on Deep Space-1, is an
all digital unit that provides Ka-band or X-band downlink from an X-band uplink.
It also incorporates the command detection unit and telemetry modulation unit
into the transponder package. The transponder weighs 3 kg and consumes 12.9 W
power.
9.4.6 Antennas

wish to select other types of antennas that are lighter. Helix and horn antennas
are good choices for medium-gain applications. A low-gain (hence wide beam)
antenna is required for conditions where the vector to the ground station is not
predictable, for example, emergency conditions, maneuvers, or launch. A biconical
horn is a good choice for low-gain antenna; it produces a toroidal beam with a
beamwidth 40 x 360 deg. Figure 9.28 shows the Magellan antenna system.
The Magellan high-gain antenna was used for high-data-rate telemetry (268.6
ksps) at X-band and as the synthetic aperture radar antenna for surface images
made at S-band. The medium-gain horn was used for routine command reception
and low-rate-data transmission. The low-gain turnstile, mounted on the high-gain
feed, was used for emergency command reception.
Figure 9.29 shows mass as a function of diameter for rigid parabolic antennas.
The best fit for the antenna data in Fig. 9.29 is
Wa = 2.89 - 2.59 (9.63)
where Wa = mass of parabolic antenna and feed, kg, and D = diameter of an-
tenna, m. Figure 9.29 is for rigid antennas. There is a new class of furlable mesh
parabolic antennas that provide lower mass and allow diameters greater than launch
vehicle shrouds. These antennas are more expensive and require an unfurling
mechanism.
Table 9.11, which shows the mass of a variety of medium- and low-gain anten-
nas, can be used for mass estimation by analogy. The Magellan communication
system weight statement and power summary, shown in Table 9.12, is useful for
estimating X- or S-band communication system mass and power by analogy.

490 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
9.5 Ground Stations
Tracking stations have three functions: 1) receiving downlink data and trans-
mitting it to the operations team; 2) unlinking spacecraft commands; and 3) deter-
mining range, range rate, azimuth and elevation of the spacecraft. The processing
of downlink data is not normally done at the ground station nor is the opera-
tions team located at the station. The U.S. Government operates seven different
spacecraft communication networks5; these four are the most commonly used:
1) Space Tracking and Data Network (STDN) managed by NASA Goddard, Space
Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland; 2) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System
(TDRSS) managed by NASA Goddard; 3) Space Ground Link System (SGLA)
managed by the U.S. Air Force, and 4) Deep Space Network (DSN) managed by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, for NASA.
9.5.1 Space Tracking and Data Net
STDN is the oldest and original NASA satellite communication and tracking
system. The system is controlled and maintained by NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center. It is composed of the ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico, and
ground stations around the world, as shown in Table 9.13.
Included in the STDN network are telephone, microwave, radio, submarine ca-
bles are various computer systems. The major switching centers are at Goddard
Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Cape Canaveral. The com-
puter system controls tracking antennas, and commands and processes data for
transmission to Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Goddard Space Flight Center
(GSFC) control centers. Shuttle data from all tracking stations are funneled into
the main switching computers at GSFC and rerouted to JSC, without delay, through
domestic communication satellites.
The tracking station at Ponce de Leon Inlet, Florida, near New Smyrna Beach,
is used during launch to provide a data link that is free of solid motor exhaust
interference. This is primarily a shuttle service. Also supporting STDN are several
instrumented U.S. Air Force aircraft that are situated, upon request, at almost any
location in the world. This service is primarily to support the space Shuttle. The
global coverage of the STDN stations is shown in Fig. 9.30.

Note that STDN requires numerous handoffs and has unavoidable gaps in cov-
erage. Gaps are much worse for orbits with inclinations above 30 deg. The STDN
system is being phased out in favor of TDRSS.
9.5.2 Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
TDRSS, shown in Fig. 9.31, uses a constellation of (currently eight) spacecraft
in geosynchronous orbit. The system serves as a radio relay carrying voice, analog,
TV, or digital data. The constellation can provide continuous communication with

any Earth-orbiting spacecraft at latitudes of less than about 80 deg. In downlink,
a spacecraft communicates with the closest TDRSS; the data are relayed to the
ground station at White Sands, New Mexico, or Guam, where they can be relayed
to the appropriate spacecraft operations center by ground line or radio link. In
uplink, commands are sent to White Sands and uplinked to the spacecraft via one
or more of the TDRSS spacecraft.
The system offers S-band, C-band, and high-capacity Ku- and Ka-band with
single- or multiple-access channels. The C-band transponders work at 12 to 14
GHz, the Ku-band at 14 GHz. Both single-access and multiple-access channels
are offered.
The spacecraft in the constellation are in three states of readiness: 1) operational;
2) stored spare, available for immediate callup; and 3) powered-down standby,
which requires about a week to bring to operational state.
The original seven TDRSS spacecraft were designed and built by TRW's De-
fense and Space Systems Group. When launched in 1982, TDRS 1, at 2300 kg,
was one of the largest of the communication satellites. The three-axis-stabilized,
nadir-pointing spacecraft is designed with three distinct and separable modules:
the equipment module, the communication payload module, and the antenna
module.
The new generation TDRS H, I, and J competition was won by Boeing Satellite
Systems, formerly Hughes Space. TDRS H, I, and J are scheduled to be launched
by 2002. TDRS H, I, and J replicate the services of TDRS 1 through 7, and in
addition, Ka band service, enhanced multiple access, forward data rates of 25
Mbps and return data rates of 800 Mbps are provided. The services supplied by
spacecraft 1 through 7 and the new H, I, and J are summarized in Table 9.14.
Operational control of the TDRSS spacecraft is from the White Sands complex
near Las Cruces, New Mexico. The TDRSS project is directed by Goddard Space
Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.
9.5.3 Deep Space Net
Planetary spacecraft, deep space probes (for example, NEAR), and Earth-
orbiting spacecraft above about 5000 km use the Deep Space Network (DSN),
which is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.

Fig. 9.32 A day in communication with the DSN.
The DSN consists of three ground stations spaced around the globe such that
a planetary spacecraft in, or near, the ecliptic plane always has at least one in
view. There are stations at Goldstone, California; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid,
Spain; the daily activities of a planetary spacecraft involve all three stations (see
Fig. 9.32). There is a DSN support and test station at Kennedy Space Center
(KSC) on Merritt Island, Florida (MILA). MILA is very likely the first DSN sta-
tion a planetary spacecraft will link to; this will occur during prelaunch testing at
KSC.
9.5.3.1 70-m subnet. The antenna systems of a given size at each station
are called a subnet. For example, the 70-m subnet includes a 70-m-diam parabolic
antenna at Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra. The 70-m antennas were originally
built as 64-m antennas in 1964 in support of the Mariner 4 mission to Mars. All
three were expanded to 70-m diam in 1982-1988 to support Voyager 2's Neptune
encounter. These big antennas are the backbone of planetary communication; the
Goldstone 70-m system is also used for radio astronomy.
9.5.3.2 34-m high-efficiency (HEF) subnet. This subnet was installed to
replace the older 34-m standard subnet, which had a polar axis design and was
originally built with 26-m reflectors. The latter upgraded to 34 m required repo-
sitioning and lifting the entire system onto concrete footings so that the reflector
would not strike the ground at low pointing angles. The 34-m STD subnet has
been dismantled at Madrid and Canberra. The 34-m STD at Goldstone was con-
verted to an educational resource and renamed the Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio
Telescope.
The modern 34-m HEF was designed with more efficient azimuth-elevation
mounting and a 34-m precision reflector from the start. The subnet is used primarily
for deep space missions, but may occasionally support a mission in high Earth orbit.
The subnet can support X-band uplink and downlink and S-band downlink.
9.5.3.3 34-m beam-wave-guide (BWG) subnet. These, newest of the
subnets, can be recognized by a hole in the center of the reflector where the feed
horn cone full of microwave equipment would normally be. The BWG design does

not require sensitive equipment mounted in the space around the feed horn where
it is difficult to access and maintain. Instead, the beam wave guide directs the
microwave beam through waveguides and by precision microwave mirrors down
into the basement where equipment can be stably and precisely mounted and where
access for maintenance is not a problem. This subnet generally supports X-band
and S-band uplink and downlink. At Goldstone, Ka-band uplink and downlink is
also supported.
9.5.3.4 26-m subnet. This subnet is used for rapid tracking of Earth-
orbiting spacecraft usually in high Earth orbits. It was originally built in support
of the Apollo mission in 1967-1972.
DSN time is a precious commodity because it is shared by all planetary programs
including the few that are done by ESA. The 70-m antennas are particularly scarce
because there are fewer of them, and all key events (encounter, orbit insertion, etc.)
use the big antennas. Designs that minimize DSN time, particularly 70-m antenna
time, should be recognized in your trade studies. The DSN station characteristics
are listed in Table 9.15.
9.5.4 Acquisition of Signal
All ground stations require handoffs and frequent acquisition of signal (AOS) as
the spacecraft passes from station to station. Acquisition of signal by the receiving
station is a multidimensional problem. First, the ground antenna must be pointed
at the location of the a spacecraft in direction and azimuth angle. (This can be done
by the DSN to a few thousandths of a degree.) Next, the carrier must be located by
a search over a narrowband of the frequency spectrum. Next, a phase acquisition
is performed; the phase is then locked on by a phase-locked loop, which is an
electronic servocontrol loop. Symbol synchronization, which is similar to phase
synchronization, is next. The receiver must be able to produce a square wave that
passes through zero at the same time as the received signal; this is called symbol
lock. The final step is frame synchronization. Frame synchronization is required
when the data are organized in blocks, frames, or packets. When direction, azimuth,

the system is said to be in lock.
9.6 Space Navigation and Tracking*
Spacecraft navigation is intimately associated with the communication system,
particularly on a deep-space mission. Navigating a spacecraft using a radio link
requires the following information with respect to a receiving station: 1) radial
distance to spacecraft, 2) radial velocity of spacecraft, 3) velocity of spacecraft in
the plane of the sky, and 4) angular direction to spacecraft.
All of these data are with respect to an antenna mounted on Earth, which rotates
on its axis and rotates about the sun. In addition, a planetary spacecraft is rotat-
ing about the sun or rotating about a planet, which rotates about the sun. These
planetary motions are well understood and can be combined with the preceding
four sets of spacecraft/antenna relative data to produce a three-dimensional model
of spacecraft motion in inertial coordinates. The model then can reproduce the
history of spacecraft position and predict the future spacecraft positions.
Future position predictions (called "predicts") are used to determine if trajectory
correction maneuvers (TCMs) are required. The history of spacecraft positions is
an essential part of the reconstruction of its observations and images of the planet it
is studying. The Magellan primary data were a collection of digital data sets, each
representing a strip of Venus surface approximately 25 km wide and 16,000 km
long. Minutely accurate position history was necessary to convert the strips into a
map.
The following paragraphs will describe how spacecraft position and velocity
data are obtained.
9.6.1 Velocity Measurement
Doppler measurements of the spacecraft downlink carrier frequency are the
primary measurement of spacecraft velocity perpendicular to the plane of the
sky. For this purpose, an extremely stable downlink frequency is required. It is
necessary to measure Doppler shifts on the order of 1 Hz in a carrier frequency of
many gigahertz. It is currently impossible to maintain such stability with spacecraft
onboard equipment. The ingenious solution is to have the spacecraft generate a
downlink carrier frequency, which is phase coherent to the extremely accurate
uplink frequency it receives.
9.6.1.1 Two-way coherent mode. In coherent mode the ground station
controls the frequency of the downlink. This is done by transmitting an uplink
with a very accurate and stable frequency. At the DSN stations this frequency is
provided by a temperature-controlled hydrogen-maser-based frequency standard.
The stability of the DSN hydrogen masers is ±1 s in 30 million years. The masers
also control the DSN master clocks, which distribute universal time.

of Spaceflight,"17 an educational document also available online at www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics.

<<<PAGE 508>>>

496 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
On the spacecraft the uplink frequency is multiplied by a preset factor, for exam-
ple 240/210, to provide the same extraordinary accuracy on a downlink frequency.
(The uplink and downlink frequencies must differ, of course, to prevent direct sig-
nal interference.) The DSN calls the coherent mode of communication two-way
coherent or just two way.
The two-way coherent mode permits the measurement of velocity-induced
Doppler shift to within 1 Hz. The resulting Doppler shift is directly proportional
to the radial component of the spacecraft's velocity, relative to the DSN antenna.
This relative velocity can be corrected for the rates of movement of the Earth in its
revolution about the sun and its axial rotation, to produce the spacecraft velocity
perpendicular to the plane of the sky, in inertial coordinates.
9.6.1.2 Transmission modes. Most spacecraft can also invoke a noncoher-
ent mode that does not use the uplink frequency as a downlink reference. Instead,
the spacecraft uses its onboard oscillator as a reference for generating its down-
link frequency. This mode is known as two-way noncoherent (the mode is called
"twink" by the DSN). When a spacecraft is receiving an uplink from one station
and its coherent downlink is being received by two stations, the downlink is said
to be three-way coherent.
9.6.1.3 Data loss in mode change. A data loss can occur when the com-
munication mode is switched. Consider a ground station in lock, on a noncoherent
downlink from a spacecraft. (The DSN calls this situation one-way transmission.)
When the ground station sends uplink to the spacecraft, it will lock on to the up-
link and switch to coherent mode using the uplink frequency. The new downlink
frequency will be different, more stable but different. The ground station will see a
loss of signal on the old frequency and lose lock. The ground station can anticipate
this event; the timing is precisely known and can react rapidly, but a small loss of
data is common. It is wise not to plan critical data transfer during a mode change
or a ground station handoff.
9.6.2 Range Measurement (Ranging)
A uniquely coded ranging pulse is added to the uplink to a spacecraft, and its
transmission time is recorded. When the spacecraft receives the ranging pulse, it
returns the pulse on its downlink. The time it takes the spacecraft to turn the pulse
around within its electronics is known from prelaunch testing. When the pulse is
received at the DSN, its true elapsed time is determined, and the spacecraft's dis-
tance can then computed to centimeter accuracy. Distance can also be determined,
as well as its angular position, using VLBI as described in Section 9.6.3.1.
9.6.3 Angular Measurement
The angles at which the DSN antennas point are recorded with high accuracy
(0.001 deg), but even more precise angular measurements, can be provided by
VLBI and by differenced Doppler.
9.6.3.1 VLBI. A VLBI observation of a spacecraft begins when two DSN
stations on separate continents, separated by a very long baseline, track a single

spacecraft simultaneously as shown in Fig. 9.33. High-rate recordings are made
of the downlink's wave fronts by each station, together with precise timing data.
DSN antenna pointing angles are also recorded.
After a few minutes, and while still recording, both DSN antennas slew directly
to the position of a quasar, which is an extragalactic object whose position is known
with high accuracy. Then they slew back to the spacecraft and end recording
a few minutes later. Correlation and analysis of the recorded data yield a very
precise triangulation from which both angular position and radial distance can
be determined. This process requires knowledge of each station's location with
respect to the location of Earth's axis with very high precision. Currently, these
locations are known to within 3 cm. Their locations must be determined repeatedly
because the location of the Earth's rotational axis varies several meters over a
period of a decade and continental plate motion on the order of centimeters also
occurs.
9.6.3.2 Differenced Doppler. Differenced Doppler can provide a measure
of a spacecraft's changing three-dimensional position. To visualize this, consider
a spacecraft orbiting a planet. If the orbit is in a vertical plane edge on to you, as
shown in Fig. 9.34, you would observe the downlink to take a higher frequency
as it travels toward you. As it recedes away from you, and behind the planet, you

498 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
notice a lower frequency. Now, imagine a second observer halfway across the
Earth. Because the orbit plane is not exactly edge-on as that observer sees it,
the other observer will record a slightly different Doppler signature. If you and
the other observer compare notes and difference your data sets, you would have
enough information to determine both the spacecraft's changing velocity and
position in three-dimensional space. Two DSNs separated by a large baseline
do exactly this. One DSN provides an uplink to the spacecraft so it can generate
a stable downlink, which is received by both stations. The differenced data sets,
high-precision knowledge of DSN station positions, as well as a precise character-
ization of atmospheric refraction, make it possible for DSN to measure spacecraft
velocities accurate to within hundredths of a millimeter per second, and angular
position to within 9 nanoradians.
9.6.4 Optical Navigation
Spacecraft that are equipped with imaging instruments can use them to observe
the spacecraft's destination planet against a known background star field. These
images are called OPNAV images. Interpretation of them provides a very precise
data set useful for refining knowledge of a spacecraft's trajectory.
9.6.5 Orbit Determination
Orbit determination computer solutions use the laws orbital mechanics, along
with the navigation data just described, and the mass of the sun and planets, their
ephemeris and barycentric movement. The effects of the solar wind, a detailed
planetary gravity field model, attitude management thruster firings, and atmo-
spheric friction are also used in the computations. Orbit determination is an iterative
process, building upon the results of earlier solutions.
A fascinating quote from "Basics of Space Flight" available online at http://
www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics shows how far this science has come:
The highly automated and refined process of orbit determination is taken for
granted today. During the effort to launch America's first satellites, the JPL
Explorer 1 and 2, a room-sized IBM computer was employed to compute the
satellite's trajectory using Doppler data from Cape Canaveral and a few other
tracking sites. The late Caltech physics professor Richard Feynman was asked to
come to the Lab and assist with difficulties encountered in processing the data.
He accomplished all of the calculations by hand, revealing the fact that Explorer
2 had failed to achieve orbit, and had come down in the Atlantic Ocean. The JPL
mainframe was eventually coaxed to reach the same result, hours after Professor
Feynman had departed for the weekend.
Once a planetary spacecraft's solar orbital parameters are known, they are com-
pared to those desired. To correct any discrepancy, a TCM may be planned and
executed. This involves computing the direction and magnitude of the vector
required to correct to the desired trajectory. Usually TCM maneuvers are per-
formed just after insertion before launch errors build and again near the target
planet to refine arrival targeting. The design of these maneuvers was discussed in
Chapter 4.

9.3 A digital spacecraft to Earth communication system operating at 2.256 GHz
and using a 32:6 biorthoganal block code is designed to operate at a bit error rate
(BER) of 10~3 when the receiving antenna is pointed at the spacecraft near the
horizon. The cable loss is 0.5 dB, and the receiver noise figure is 1.5 dB. The
antenna noise temperature is 90 K near the horizon and 1.5 K near zenith. During
operation, as the spacecraft moves and the receiving antenna is pointed near the
zenith, what BER can be achieved?
Solution: BER = 2.2 E-5.
9.4 A spacecraft is in orbit around Venus and transmits an acquisition carrier
signal to the DSN. The radial velocity between spacecraft and DSN station varies
as a result of the axial rotation of the planets and the orbital motion of the spacecraft
about Venus. The radial velocity of the spacecraft with respect to Earth ranges
between +3.6576 km/s to —3.6576 km/s. Concurrently and in an uncorrelated
manner, the radial velocity of the DSN station ranges from 9. 144 km/s to 6.096 km/s.
If the spacecraft transmitter frequency is 8.5 GHz, what are the maximum and
minimum recieved frequencies that the DSN must accomodate?
9.5 The required EIRP of a spacecraft transmitting system is 70 dBm at a fre-
quency of 2.3 GHz. It is desired to achieve the EIRP with minimum weight. An
analysis of the weight of parabolic antennas in this size range yields the following
approximation:
W — C -\- 2D2Vva — ^a ^ ^LJ
where Ca is a constant, the antenna diameter D is in feet and weight, and Wa is in
pounds. Similarly, the power supply weight Wp is
where Cp is a constant, Pt is power in watts, and Wp is in pounds.
Find the antenna diameter and the transmitted power for a minimum sum of the
antenna and power supply weights.
Solution: D = 0.965ft and P = 45.46 dBm.
9.6 The system noise temperature Ts is calculated at the input to the receiver
of a ground station. It has contributions from the antenna rant, from the cabling
losses from antenna to receiver TC9 and from the receiver itself Tr. The frequency
received at the ground antenna pointed at the horizon is 2297 MHz. The antenna
noise temperature Ta is 90 K. The cable losses are 1 dB . The receiver noise figure
F is 3 dB. The reference temperature TO is 290 K. Determine the percentages of
system noise temperature contributed by rant, Tc, and Tr.
9.7 The DSN station 70-m parabolic reflector antenna system is used to receive
spacecraft S-band carrier at 2298 MHz. For acquisition at a range of 1 00 million km,
it is desired to have a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB in a 10-Hz noise bandwidth.

Structures*

10.1 Introduction
Structure is the stuff that holds things together. It provides support for all load
environments from prelaunch through launch and includes on-orbit loads. In this
chapter we include mechanisms with structure to encompass all spacecraft me-
chanical support systems.
Structure is often what you see when you look at a spacecraft, but a spacecraft
designer's goal is to minimize structure as much as possible. Just think, if you could
save structural mass you could add more fuel to extend life, or more transponders to
generate income on a communication satellite, or more instruments on a scientific
investigation. As long as it meets the functional requirements of the rest of the
mission system, structure is best when minimized. Section 10.2 will show how
this is done.
To be successful, the structure must survive all environments without detrimen-
tal deformation. Environments are loads on the structure. Loads are converted to
stresses, then stresses are converted to strains, and then strains are converted to de-
formation. In this way environments cause deformation and potentially failure; the
job of the structures designer is to prevent this failure, as described in Section 10.3.
Section 10.2 explains why mechanisms are required—to stow structures in pay-
load fairings and to operate equipment in flight. Section 10.4 describes some of
the key rules in designing and analyzing mechanisms.
Sections 10.5 and 10.6 detail some of the analyses and tests required to verify
the functionality and performance of mechanical equipment. Because there are an
infinite number of options for how to verify hardware, these chapters just explain
what the analyses and tests are and why they are used.
10.1.1 Structures Development Planning
When you are planning the development of a spacecraft structure, you need to
know what the tasks are, what is required to perform these tasks in the form of
resources, and how long they will take. That philosophy is great for building the
100,000th car, but most spacecraft are unique in design. Why does that matter?
The first time you do anything complex like building a spacecraft things always go
wrong. Yes, it helps to detail out the planning steps, but things always go wrong.
A vendor will ship bolts that are different than those ordered; delivered materials
properties are not as expected; someone dropped a wrench on the brittle material;
a mistake was made in calculation of strength, and the hardware broke in test; parts

do not fit, either as a result of tolerances or machining errors; loads are determined
to increase six months before flight. It is a scary world out there.
Fortunately, many organizations have developed plans either to avoid these
problems or to be able to recover from them. First, an overall program flow of
tasks is developed for the structure, such as that shown in Fig. 10.1. This flow is
repetitive in nature; as programs mature and problems occur, developers need to
build in a chance to get things right before it is too late. Therefore, most programs
will perform a complete load and stress analysis of the spacecraft design in the
first few months of a program, prior to PDR. Obviously, this approach will not
have the confidence to be ready to launch, but all of the "big picture" problems
are uncovered at this level. Next a more detailed design and analysis is performed,
where an attempt is made to uncover all potential problems, and plans are made
to avoid them, prior to CDR. This is where material is ordered and fabrication
started, and some problems, which will require workarounds, are discovered. The
third column concentrates on fabrication, assembly, and testing. This is where the
program wants to uncover problems—no surprises after launch! These problems
will require workarounds, which cause shedding of blood, sweat, and sometimes
tears. But all of that will be well worth it when the final verification analysis report
is complete prior to launch, which documents all of the work done, how all of the
problems were resolved, and how the spacecraft is ready for launch.
A summary of the typical structural design and verification approach contained
in this chapter is presented in Fig. 10.1. The general flowchart of Fig. 10.1 is
subdivided into detailed task plans for the structures subsystem, as some complex
projects can have hundreds and even thousands of task entries. Although this might
seem difficult to manage, greater detail usually means more problems are avoided.
10.1.2 Coordinate Systems, Sign Conventions, and the Metric
System
Coordinate systems generally use one of three options: airplane, rocket, or space-
craft. Airplanes use a coordinate system with x originating at the nose and increas-
ing to the rear. Rotation about this axis is roll. The axis out the wings is y, with
rotation pitch, and the z axis is yaw. Launch vehicles use a similar coordinate sys-
tem, but the x axis originates at ground level in the liftoff configuration, y is still
out the sides and perpendicular to the plane of trajectory curvature. Note, however,
that sign convention requires the use of the right-hand rule (if your right-hand
fingers are pointed in the x direction then rotated towards y, your thumb points in
the z direction). Therefore, if y is starboard on an airplane, either y or z has to be
flipped 180 deg on a rocket.
Spacecraft occasionally use airplane or rocket sign convention. Usually it is
important to align the spacecraft with the launch vehicle coordinate system to
avoid errors. Once in orbit, the spacecraft often takes on a different coordinate
system. For instance, instruments might want to point nadir (towards a planet)
all of the time; the side of the spacecraft on which the instruments are mounted
might be identified as nadir, and the opposite as antinadir or zenith. Sometimes
the velocity vector is important, because of reentry fluxes in the atmosphere as
with a reentry capsule, and velocity and antivelocity are used. And sometimes the
solar flux on a spacecraft is the most important factor in design and operation of a

spacecraft that maintains a constant attitude to the sun, and solar/antisolar is used.
Figure 10.2 shows the most common spacecraft axis system.
Design and analysis uses U.S. customary or the International System of Units
(SI). Typically, customers request that the metric system be used to avoid poten-
tially catastrophic problems as with NASA's Mars '98 Orbiter. But much hardware
in the United States is unavailable in metric sizes. Can you imagine going to a hard-
ware store and buying lumber with dimensions 2 cm by 4 cm by 2 m? It will be
a while. Similarly, hardware available to spacecraft is mostly in nonmetric units.
Designers simply need to work with this, usually by indicating on drawings a pri-
mary dimension (metric) and a reference dimension (U.S.) in parentheses. Other
metric units are easier to implement. For instance, kilograms are actually easier
to use than slugs, and pounds are a unit of force, not mass. Until procured raw
materials can be dimensioned in metric units, including tolerances, full adoption
of metric-only dimensions is not realistic.
10.2 Spacecraft Configuration Design
Initial sketch drawings of the configuration are one of the first steps in a space-
craft design. An initial attempt is made to incorporate all known requirements and
constraints into a reasonable general arrangement. Two general arrangements are
normally required: 1) a launch configuration that will fit within the launch vehicle
shroud and 2) a mission configuration with antennas, booms, and science platforms
deployed. The spacecraft mechanisms list starts with the mechanisms required for
these deployments.
The general arrangement is an iterative process, as are all of the subsystem
designs. As soon as an arrangement is finished, a list of potential problems and
potential improvements is developed from which trade studies are conducted and

STRUCTURES 507
another configuration developed. As the design progresses, the changes in the
configuration become less global, and the general arrangement has been fixed.
Changes continue at a lower level.
The structural support concept, the general thermal design, the electronics lay-
outs, the attitude control layout, the propulsion layout, and the mechanisms list all
flow from the general arrangement.
10.2.1 Constraints
Unlike an airplane, the form of a spacecraft has no function; any shape will do.
However, there are numerous constraints on the arrangement. General arrangement
is a compromise between the requirements for 1) field of view for instruments,
antennas, radiators, solar panels, rocket motors; 2) thermal control requirements;
3) center of mass; 4) ratio of moments of inertia (for spinners); 5) propulsion lever
arm; 6) constraints of launch vehicle shroud; and 7) constraints on sun vector and
Earth vector.
10.2. 1 . 1 Field of view. Much of the equipment onboard a spacecraft re-
quires a certain field of view. Most scientific instruments — all antennas, all rocket
motors, all solar panels, and most electronics, and all radiators — require a view
of space. Voyager, shown in Fig. 10.3, is a classic Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(JPL) spacecraft arrangement and illustrates a design complying with field-of-view
constraints.
The Voyager mission was a multiplanet flyby. The science instruments, all but
one, required an unobstructed view of each target planet with the planet at any

position with respect to the spacecraft. This stiff requirement was met with an
articulated instrument platform shown at the right of Fig. 10.3.
The high-gain antenna was fixed to the top of the bus and pointed at Earth
by maneuvering the spacecraft. Direct mounting to the bus provided maximum
pointing stability for the antenna. An antenna requires a clear field of view in the
entire hemisphere above the aperture plane. Magellan, Galileo, TELESTAR, and
numerous spacecraft dedicate an entire hemisphere to a high-gain antenna.
The radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), lower left in Fig. 10.4, re-
quire a maximum view of space to reject excess heat. Placing them on a deploy able
platform met this requirement. Although there are axial obstructions to the field
of view, the cylindrical slice of sky centered on the long axis of the RTGs is the
most important and is completely clear. The RTGs also emit radiation harmful

to electronics. The deployment structure also provides some separation distance,
which moderates this problem.
The 10-sided bus body is an excellent arrangement from a number of viewpoints.
The electronics is installed in each of the 10 boxes. One side of each has a clear
view of space for heat rejection, which is controlled by louvers. More about this
polygon configuration type, which was first devised by JPL, is given later in this
chapter.
10.2.1.2 Nadir pointing. Nadir pointing is a special, and common, field-of-
view requirement, which dictates that the spacecraft z axis be pointed at the planet
center at all times. LANDSAT C, Fig. 10.4, is a typical nadir-pointing spacecraft.
The entire nadir face was dedicated to the mounting of Earth-sensing instruments.
The spacecraft bus equipment was mounted above the instrument ring and between
two rotating solar panels. The panels were folded back like elephant ears, to fit
within the launch vehicle shroud.
10.2.1.3 Moments of inertia. Spinners must constrain the moments of
inertia around the spacecraft axes for stability. A spinner must have its mass dis-
tributed like a fly wheel with the spin axis coincident with the axis of maximum
moment of inertia. For dynamic stability the moment of inertia about the spin axis
must be greater than the moment of inertia about any other axis (see Fig. 10.5).
If this criterion is not met, the spacecraft will change spin axis with time to arrive
at a stable spin around the axis of greatest moment of inertia. Explorer I, the first
U.S. spacecraft, demonstrated this principle in flight. This spacecraft was shaped
like a bullet and was launched spinning around the long axis, the axis of least
moment of inertia. After a few days the MOS team detected that the rotation had
switched to the axis of maximum moment of inertia. A rigid spacecraft, without
damping, is statically and stably spinning around the axis of minimum moment of
inertia; however, this is not practical in the real world of damped, slightly flexible
structures.

Launch Configuration Mapping Configuration

Martin; Ref. 14.)
10.2.1.4 Launch vehicle. The launch vehicle shroud limits the spacecraft
to a dynamic envelope diameter about the z axis and to a length in the z direction.
The diameter is usually the most severe restriction. Shroud diameters are typically
8, 10, 12, and 15 ft; the shuttle bay envelope is 15 ft. For a given launch vehicle,
larger shroud diameters mean heavier shrouds and lower allowable spacecraft
mass. For almost all spacecraft the shroud size causes a launch configuration that is
different from the deployed configuration with attendant deployment mechanisms.
The Mars Observer stowed and deployed configuration is shown in Fig. 10.6.
The launch vehicle adapter makes the mechanical transition from the launch
vehicle interface to the spacecraft structure; the adapter is the responsibility of
the spacecraft team, and the adapter mass is charged to the spacecraft. The Inter-
national Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems1 contains data on launch ve-
hicle shrouds and mechanical interfaces for all active launch vehicles.
10.2.1.5 Propulsion system. The propulsion system requires the longest
lever arm obtainable, which is normally limited by the shroud diameter. All rocket
motors require a clear field of view aft of the nozzle exit plane. If a clear field
is not provided, the exhaust gases will be deflected as will the thrust vector; the
net result is a greater than anticipated fuel consumption and reduced mission
life. Problems with plume impingement are not easy to find on the ground but
are immediately obvious in flight. It is also important to consider the possibility
of propulsion exhaust contaminating thermal surfaces and optics. If solid rocket
motors are used, the thrust line must pass through the center of mass. The most
common way to achieve this alignment is to center the solid motor on the — z axis.
Propellant tanks are heavy components and are normally centered on the
z axis of three-axis-stabilized spacecraft. Spinner designs normally employ two or
four tanks mounted on the outer perimeter equidistant from the spin axis for high
moment of inertia.

STRUCTURES 511
10.2.1.6 Sun vector. The solar panel axis must be perpendicular to the
sun vector if two-degree-of-freedom articulation is to be avoided. The sun vector
is strictly prohibited from the field of view of light-sensitive instruments such as
cameras, star scanners, horizon sensors, and spectrometers. The instruments can be
designed to protect against sunlight (with cover mechanisms for example), or the
attitude control system (ACS) computer can protect the instruments via software.
The preferred approach is to designate sun-free faces and mount the instruments
accordingly; even in this case backup protection should be considered.
It is highly desirable to keep the sun off of louvers and other heat-rejection
faces. The typical heat-rejection faces are the electronics mount plates and the
shunt radiator for the power system. In addition, some instruments have cooling
radiators. It is possible to design the thermal control system to withstand sun on
the heat rejection faces as Magellan did, but it is desirable to avoid this situation
if possible.
10.2.1.7 Togetherness. There are several equipment items that need to be
mounted together:
1) It is desirable for the telecommunications system to be installed as close to
the antennas as possible to minimize cable losses.
2) Batteries are another heavy component. It would be tempting to place batteries
across from each other, equidistant from the center of mass for balance reasons;
however, multiple batteries must be installed side by side and with the power
control equipment in order to save cable mass and complexity.
3) The attitude control sensors and gyros need to be attached to a common, very
rigid structure. On Magellan a beryllium optical bench was used to mount the gyros
and star scanner. The attitude control optical bench, as well as telecommunications
mounting, is shown in Fig. 10.7.
4) It is desirable to mount liquid propulsion equipment on or near the tanks and
to configure the system as a separable module so that hazardous operations can
be accomplished remotely. The Magellan modular propulsion system is shown
in Fig. 10.8. Solid motors are inherently modular; however, special mounting
arrangements are required to bring loads into solid rocket motor (SRM) cases,
especially point loads.
5) If the command and data handling (C&DH) system and the ACS share a central
computer, it is important that they be located together. Short communication lines
to a computer are important.
10.2.1.8 Staging planes. It is usually better to leave the launch vehicle
adapter on the spent launch vehicle, thus minimizing spacecraft mass. With this
arrangement the staging plane is at the upper face of the adapter, and the launch
vehicle interface is at the lower face of the adapter.
If the spacecraft carries a solid rocket motor, it is desirable to stage the spent
motor and support structure, thereby reducing the mass load on the attitude control
system. With this arrangement the spacecraft will have two staging planes.
10.2.1.9 Pyrotechnic Shock. Electronic equipment is particularly suscep-
tible to damage from pyrotechnic shock. It is highly desirable to separate elec-
tronics from ordnance devices. Because the shock energy is transmitted through

the structure, separation in this case means a long structural path from the shock
source to the electronics. The propulsion system, staging planes, and deployment
devices are the usual ordnance sources. Mechanical joints attenuate shock well.
Low shock ordnance, which is designed to minimize shock energy, is also avail-
able. It is particularly important to consider pyrotechnic shock in early layouts
because testing cannot occur until late in a program when high-fidelity struc-
ture and ordnance are available. By this time design options are limited and
expensive.
10.2.2 General Arrangement Types
10.2.2.1 JPL polygon. The JPL polygon (Fig. 10.9) was first used on
Mariner 1 and 2 in 1962 and was the dominant design for three-axis-stabilized plan-
etary spacecraft for 40 years, being used on all Mariners, Viking Orbiter, Voyager,
Magellan, Galileo, and some non-JPL spacecraft, for example, FLTSATCOM,
HEO.
As shown in Fig. 10.10, the electronic boards are mounted directly to the front
shear plate, and a louver is installed on the opposite side. Cables are connected
to a ring harness that runs around the inside of the bus. There are no electronics
boxes. The electronics are physically protected by the load-bearing bus structure.
All electronics box weight is saved. The negative side of the integral electronics
design is that the electronics must be packaged on custom boards that fit the bus.
Also, special fixtures are required to remove boards when the structure is carrying
loads. Note that the open center of the bus is an excellent location for propellant
tanks on the z axis near the e.g.

Each bay has a clear hemispherical view of space. This is an excellent arrange-
ment for instrument view and for thermal control. The number of bays can be
selected to serve the equipment needing view or good heat rejection. Eight- and
ten-bay configurations have flown. The center opening inside the polygon is an
excellent location for cables and for propulsion tanks or solid motors. Access to
the bays is obtained by removal of the inner and outer shear plates. The advantages
of polygon bay configuration are 1) very efficient use of weight and volume;
2) inherently stiff, strong structure; 3) excellent thermal control arrangement;
4) access to the electronics and cabling is good; 5) simple, direct, protected path
around the inside of the polygon, for power and data cabling; and 6) excellent
hemispherical field of view from each bay.
The disadvantages of polygon bay configuration are 1) off-the-shelf electronics
requires repackaging and 2) in heavier spacecraft bay removal might require special
tooling.
10.2.2.2 Hinged panel. FLTS ATCOM also used polygon buses, two bolted
together, as shown in Fig. 10.11. Note from Fig. 10.11 that the bay shear plates
are hinged for easy equipment access and that electronic boxes are mounted on
the shear plates rather than integral with them. This arrangement allows existing
electronics to be used in black boxes without repackaging. Magellan also used the
hinged panel arrangement to mount some equipment.
The advantages of hinged panel construction are listed here: 1) very efficient
use of weight and volume; 2) inherently stiff, strong structure; 3) excellent thermal
control arrangement; 4) excellent access to the electronics; 5) black box electronics
can be used without repackaging; 6) simple, direct, protected path for power and
data cabling (in the center of the polygon); and 7) excellent hemispherical field of
view from each bay.

10.2.2.3 Spinning cylinder/internal shelf. Figure 10.12 shows the classic
cylindrical spinner design that originally was developed by Hughes Aircraft Com-
pany (now Boeing Satellite Systems) and used for a large number of spacecraft.
The spacecraft shown is TELSTAR 3; however, the same general arrangement was
used for SBS, ANIK, PALAPA-B, WESTAR, and others. All were dual spinners.
In the launch configuration, shown on the left, the high-gain antenna is folded
down, and the aft solar panel cylinder is retracted.
The equipment shelf, on which the high-gain antenna and telecommunication
equipment is installed, is inertially fixed, and the remainder of the spacecraft
spins, including the apogee kick motor, the external cylindrical solar panels, and
an internal equipment shelf. The shelf is adjacent to a polished heat-rejection
area in the cylindrical panel cylinder. The electronics is attached to the top of
the spun shelf, and the propulsion system is attached to the bottom of the shelf.
The Landsat C (Fig. 10.2) is an example of a three-axis-stabilized, nadir-pointing
spacecraft that uses shelf-mounted equipment. The nadir-pointing instruments are
mounted on the bottom of the shelf, and the electronics is mounted on the top,
internal to the spacecraft. The Magellan spacecraft (Fig. 10.5) used shelf mounting
for some equipment.
The advantages of internal shelf mounting are 1) integrates well with a
cylindrical spinner configuration and 2) can use existing black boxes without
repackaging.
The disadvantages of internal shelf mounting are 1) access is substantially more
difficult; 2) view of space is limited to equipment near the outer walls; 3) less
efficient mass and volume usage. (For a spinner the cylinder diameter and height
is normally set by solar-panel area requirements; therefore, efficient use of the
shelf area is not an issue.)

10.2.2.4 Centerbody truss. Landsat 4, shown in, Fig. 10.13, was one
of the first spacecraft to use a centerbody truss and attach subsystem modules
to the truss. In the Landsat 4 design entire subsystems, power, attitude control,
communications, and propulsion were packaged as a single box. Each box was
attached to a triangular central truss. The design provides each subsystem excellent
access to space, and each subsystem is splendidly accessible. The design set the
trend for all future Landsats.
On the downside, subsystems must be designed to a given size and shape. Use
of similar equipment from another program is not possible without repackaging.
(This problem could be avoided by oversizing the center truss or by designing
the center truss late in the design release.) The complexity of the exterior shape
makes thermal analysis complicated and less accurate. In addition, the shape makes
thermal cavities, hot spots, possible. The advantages of centerbody mounting are
1) very efficient use of weight and volume; 2) light, simple structure; 3) excellent
hemispherical field of view from each module; 4) excellent access to the modules;
and 5) simple, direct, protected path for power and data cabling.
The disadvantages of centerbody mounting are 1) subsystems must be designed
as a module of a given shape, and 2) the complex exterior shape makes thermal
hot spots a concern.
10.2.2.5 Cubical box. Many modern spacecraft configurations are a sim-
ple, nearly cubical, box. This configuration is driven, in part, by the fact that corner
joints are heavy, so the fewer the better. This is particularly true of graphite epoxy
structure. The Mars Observer, Mars Global Surveyor, NEAR, global positioning
system (GPS), and Star Dust exemplify this trend. Figure 10.14 shows the GPS
cubical box gener arrangement.
10.2.3 Example-Preliminary General Arrangement
To make even the most preliminary equipment arrangement, you need the
following: 1) payload instruments field of view and size, 2) electronic equip-
ment mass (volume is also desirable but can be estimated), 3) solar-panel area,
4) high-gain antenna size, 5) solid rocket motor size, 6) propulsion tanks sizes,

3) The electronics system weighs 600 Ib: a) assume subsystem packing density
of 20 lb/ft3, and b) assume subsystem packaging envelope height of 10 in.
4) An 18-in.-diam cold-gas sphere is required for spacecraft attitude control.
5) A 25-in.-diam spherical SRM kick stage is to be used to obtain orbit and then
is jettisoned; weight = 500 Ib.
6) A 3-ft-diam rigid (not furlable) parabolic antenna is required to have
hemispherical field of view on the nadir (—z) side of the spacecraft; weight =
20 Ib.
7) Solar-array area = 50 ft2; weight = 20 Ib.
8) The pay load is a fixed Earth-pointing camera 12 in. in diameter, which has a
5-deg half-angle field of view; weight = 30 Ib.
9) A star scanner is used for gyro update.
10) The nadir-pointing spacecraft is to be placed in sun-synchronous Earth orbit.
Estimating the footprint of the electronics compartment,
600 = 36ft*(20)(0.83)
Arbitrarily assume a rectangular box with sides 5 ft high; using two sides for
electronics produces an equipment plate width of
(36)-12 = 43.2in.
Thus the two rectangular equipment plates would be 60 x 44 in. The rectangular
equipment box would be 60 x 44 x W, where W can be made as big as the dynamic
envelope will allow. The emerging general arrangement is shown in Fig. 10.15 in
the stowed configuration. From the requirements it is clear that the nadir face
(—z) must be occupied by the high-gain antenna and the camera. The solid rocket
motor will occupy the +z face. The solar panels can occupy the x or y faces.
The solar-panel area can be supplied by two solar panels 2.5 x 10 ft, which are
folded once into 2.5 x 5 ft packages. The gas sphere can also be installed on the
z axis. The star scanner needs a narrow, unobstructed field of view and positive
protection from seeing the sun.
Cylindrical structure was arbitrarily chosen to mount the spherical SRM and the
attitude control gas sphere. A conical launch vehicle adapter is a common choice.
Trusses could be used in these locations. Trusses can be compared to shell structure
in a later trade study. Gyros and star scanner are mounted to a common plate, and
the ACS and C&DH systems are collocated. The circular launch vehicle interface
is shown by a dotted line below the launch vehicle adapter. Two separation planes
are planned; one at the upper end of the launch vehicle adapter and another at the
SRM girth for use after the SRM burn.
The separation ordinance and propulsion ordnance is well separated from the
electronics. If ordnance is chosen for solar-panel deployment, the layout will have
to be modified to provide additional separation. Figure 10.16 shows the general
arrangement in the deployed configuration.
The solar arrays are mounted on the x axis. Because the orbit is sun synchronous,
the sun will be in the y-axis hemisphere; the spacecraft always can bring the sun
perpendicular to the solar panels by a single-axis yaw maneuver. The nadir plane

10.2.4 Preliminary Mass Estimation
Structure and mechanism mass can be estimated accurately after members are
analyzed in detail and sized. In the early phases before structural analysis has even
started, it is necessary to estimate structural mass by using relationships based on
prior programs. For early mass estimates use the initial general arrangement draw-
ing. Divide the structure into major assemblies. Use the following mass estimating
relationships to estimate the mass of each:

10.2.4.1 Primary load shell structure. Use 5 to 15 kg/m2 (4 to 11 kg/m2
for composites) depending on the type of construction, material, factor of safety,
static or dynamic loading, and difficulty of fabrication.
10.2.4.2 Lightly loaded fairing. Use 1 to 4 kg/m2 (1 to 3 kg/m2 for com-
posites) depending on material minimum gauge, vibration loading, and attachment
difficulty.
10.2.4.3 Equipment support structure. Use 15% of equipment mass.
10.2.4.4 Launch vehicle adapter. Use the relation developed in Chapter 2.
10.2.4.5 Solar-array substrate. See Chapter 6.
Total the mass of structure assemblies, and multiply by a factor of 1.2 to allow for
tolerances, joints, thermal coatings, and the like. Note that 1 lb/ft2 = 4.88 kg/m2.
The structure mass is typically 20-30% of the spacecraft dry mass.
10.2.5 Structure Types
The structural concept, and preliminary selection of structure type, flows from
the general arrangement. Different structure types may be chosen for each major
element of the spacecraft. Figure 10.17 shows some of the common types.
Skin-stringer construction is very frequently used for the central bus structure;
graphite epoxy composites are an emerging technology that offers lighter weight
for this application. Trusses are used in point load situations, typically propulsion
system mounting and launch vehicle interface structure. Honeycomb is used for
stiff, large surface area situations like solar panels and large antennas.
10.3 Structure Design
Spacecraft are subjected to various environments during their fabrication, trans-
portation and handling, testing, and service life. This section defines these vari-
ous environments and the criteria for combination of the loads induced by those
environments.
10.3.1 Environments
10.3.1.1 Preliminary loads. For conceptual and preliminary design to lo-
cate structural members and approximately size them, the applied loads to the
spacecraft must be estimated. Launch vehicles and upper stages have developed
structural capabilities for payload launch weight or "throw" weight. Knowing the
propulsive capability at different stages and knowing the vehicle weight at launch
gives a measure of the acceleration environment to which the spacecraft will be
exposed, as
Steady-state acceleration = Propulsive force/Mass (10.1)
This acceleration is most commonly expressed in g, where Ig = Earth's gravita-
tional acceleration = 32.2 ft/s2. This g loading is commonly referred to as a load

factor = -acceleration. Thus a 1,000,000-lb launch thrust acting on a 800,000-lb
launch vehicle will give a steady-state acceleration of 1.25g. At stage 3 ignition the
200,000-lb thrust will act on the remaining 100,000-lb vehicle with a steady-state
acceleration of 2g.
In addition to the steady-state components, the transient loads exciting the lower
vehicle modes will cause large spacecraft loads. Transients can also be expressed
as load factors. Transient load estimates in the early stages of design are derived
from test data and previous flight data. The third stage ignition just mentioned may
show a transient peak of 3g at the motor-to-vehicle interface. Although structural
damping could lower the acceleration response of this transient on the vehicle mass,
the transient could also excite certain vehicle modes, depending on how close the
frequency of the vehicle modes are to the frequencies of the motor and the transient
forcing function. In some cases this could result in a significant amplification as
the vehicle resonates.
These load amplifications must be calculated, and the best way to determine
this effect is to calculate the vehicle modal frequencies (eigenvalues) as well as
the shape of the vehicle as it deforms in the modes (eigenvectors). Although it is
possible to perform some analyses without computers, the availability of main-
frames to solve many simultaneous equations makes them ideal for calculating
structural responses. This is because of the advent of numerical structural analy-
sis in the form of finite elements or finite differences. Finite difference methods
work with the equilibrium equations in differential form, and finite differences are
substituted for the derivatives that appear. Finite element analysis works with an
integral form usually based on the principle of minimum potential energy. Finite
element analysis is the most common approach and the best suited for complex
shapes. Only finite element analysis will be discussed here.
Any structure can be mathematically divided into smaller pieces that lend them-
selves to straightforward solution. These pieces are called finite elements. Each
finite element consists of mass and stiffness terms that attach to grid points or
nodes. The mass and stiffness terms represent the mass and stiffness of the real
structure, which can be modeled using standard finite elements such as beams and
plates, or by more advanced terms. The equations of statics or dynamics are writ-
ten at each of these nodes in each direction; however, many springs are attached
to those nodes. Generally there are six degrees of freedom at each node, three
translation and three rotation. At some of the nodes, degrees of freedom may be
eliminated, such as when a piece of structure is attached to ground and is no longer
allowed to move. All of the equations are then assembled in a matrix and solved,
the solution giving magnitudes of deflection at each node, load or stress in each
spring, interface loads, etc.
In general, the smaller the pieces the more accurate the analysis is. The stiffness
and mass matrices can also be solved for their roots, which are the eigenvalues.

Fig. 10.18 Vibrating structure.
10.3.1.2 Vibration. All structure can be converted into the terms k, c, and
m (see Fig. 10.18). The damping term c is usually given a constant value for all
structure. This leaves only k and m as variables. If c = 0, the frequency of a
single-mass single-spring system is
2n\m0.5
(10.5)
The frequencies of many other systems can be calculated exactly, and some are
shown on the following pages. Without damping, the system would vibrate forever
under any external force input. Damping can vary widely depending on material
type and method of attachment. Normal spacecraft structures use 1-2% of critical
damping. This is viscous damping and is a function of velocity. Another type of
damping is coulomb damping, which is a function of friction.
For most structural elements the primary contribution to the critical design
load will be from steady-state and transient loads. Structure that supports other
hardware such as electronic boxes will often not have modes less than 50 Hz.
In this case random vibration is usually the highest load. The hardware can be
analyzed by driving its interface with a random vibration acceleration input, or an
equivalent analytical method can be developed using power spectral density (PSD)
as a function of response frequency. The random vibration power input to most
spacecraft peaks in the 100- to 500-Hz range, as shown in Fig. 10.19.
By using Mile's equation, an equivalent static load factor can be developed:

acoustic input. Examples are solar arrays, antennas, and large sheet metal surfaces.
Analytical methods of calculating stresses in structure caused by acoustics are less
well understood than transients, but some calculations can be made assuming the
air pressure takes the shape of the structural modes.
10.3.1.3 Load verification. As the design matures, the models also
mature. After the design is complete and most flight structure is manufactured,
the spacecraft is tested to determine the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and damping.
This is performed in a modal survey test. The structure is excited at various lo-
cations with low-level random or sine vibration input. The structural response is
measured at many locations with accelerometers. When the data are recorded,
the accelerometers will respond most when the frequency of the input vibration
reaches a structural mode (resonance frequency). The mode shapes can be deter-
mined by mapping the response of the different accelerometers. Once the modal
test is complete, the finite element model can be updated, and the loads on the
structure are verified to be safe for flight.
Transient loads are verified to be safe for flight by performing load cycle analy-
ses. For most of the structure, transients will be the biggest contributor to total load.
A description of forces with respect to time is available for all boosters. When
these forcing functions are applied to the spacecraft model (particularly when the
spacecraft model is mathematically coupled to the rest of the flight vehicle), loads
and stresses in finite elements can be obtained for each increment of time. This
analysis is called a loads analysis cycle. The final verification that these loads are
safe for flight is to perform a static-proof load test.
Random vibration testing is considered essential for all of flight hardware elec-
tronics boxes and mechanisms. Testing verifies not only that the hardware will
survive flight, but is often increased in intensity to verify workmanship of the
hardware.

528 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
Virtually all spacecraft undergo an acoustic test with all of the flight hardware
installed. Acoustic tests are controlled by computers and monitored by the loads
analyst using microphones and accelerometers. Acoustic energy is logarithmic and
doubles with each 6 dB. Acoustic tests are usually run with an overall energy level
of 142 to 148 dB.
10.3.1.4 Fabrication environment. Almost all structural parts experience
some loading conditions during the manufacturing and assembly process. Knowl-
edge of the fabrication process is required to understand if these loading conditions
are significant. The fabrication environment for flight hardware will consider the
combined effects of the fabrication process together with all other loading environ-
ments existing simultaneous with the fabrication event. Some typical fabrication
environment examples and recommended practices are listed in Table 10.1.
If stress relief is not provided, known residual stresses must be accounted for in
the analysis of subsequent loading conditions. Aerospace structures are nominally
very thin, and it is not unusual for panels, dishes, or beams to require added support
to preclude their collapse under their own weight, especially at intermediate stages
of their assembly.

10.3.1.5 Handling and transport environment. Spacecraft handling can
occur at any level of spacecraft assembly from component to pay load. Sources
of ground handling loads are hoisting and lifting, jacking, towing and moving,
braking, and ground, air or sea transport.
Handling and transport loads for flight hardware must consider all loading ex-
isting simultaneous with the handling or transport event. The specific handling
configuration must be considered as well as mass of protective covers, instrumen-
tation, and ancillary equipment. It is good practice to make certain that handling
and transport loads do not constitute the critical design condition.
10.3.1.6 Liftoff/ascent environment. The maximum predicted launch ac-
celeration is determined from the combined effects of quasi-static acceleration and
the transient response of the vehicle as a result of engine ignition, air loads, engine
burnout, and stage separation. Theses loads are unique to the ascent system and
the dynamic interaction between the ascent vehicle and the spacecraft.
Quasi-static limit loads and accelerations are specified in the payload/launch
vehicle interface agreements. These launch vehicle load factors (LLF) are typically
defined in the longitudinal (thrust axis) and lateral directions. These load factors
must be verified by coupled loads analysis.
Portions of the liftoff/ascent phase might also subject the spacecraft to a spin
environment. For components lying away from the spin axis, the radial loads from
spinning might be larger than the lateral loads.
10.3.1.7 Vibration environments. The random vibration environment is
caused by mechanically transmitted vibration from impingement of rocket en-
gine and aerodynamically generated acoustic fields on the launch vehicle as well
as mechanically transmitted structure-borne rocket engine vibrations. The maxi-
mum predicted random vibration environment is specified as an acceleration spec-
tral density (ASD; often called a power spectral density), based on a frequency
resolution of one-third octave or narrowband analysis over a frequency range of
20 to 2000 Hz.
The sine vibration environment is caused by mechanically transmitted vibration
from launch vehicle structure ringing. This environment is usually an acceleration
input at a single frequency. The maximum predicted sine vibration environment is
specified as g over the frequency range of the input.
10.3.1.8 Acoustic environment. The maximum predicted acoustic envi-
ronment is the extreme value of fluctuating pressure occurring, with varying de-
gree, on all surfaces of launch and space vehicles. This environment occurs during
liftoff, powered flight, and reentry. The maximum predicted acoustic environment
is specified as a sound pressure level (SPL) typically based on one-third octave
bands over a frequency range of 31.5 to 10,000 Hz. An example of the acoustic
level inside the fairing of a typical launch vehicle is shown in Fig. 10.20.
For structures that have significant high-frequency structural resonance and
are acoustically responsive (that is, solar arrays and large antennas), it may be
necessary to combine acoustically induced loads with structure-borne random
vibration loads to produce the total vibroacoustic loads.

10.3.1.9 Pyro shock. The pyrotechnic shock environment imposed on the
flight structure and components is caused by structural response when the space-
craft or launch vehicle electro-explosive devices are activated. Resultant structural
response accelerations resemble the form of superimposed complex decaying si-
nusoids that decay to a few percent of their maximum acceleration in 5 to 15 ms.
The maximum predicted pyrotechnic shock environment is specified as the maxi-
max absolute shock response spectrum as determined by the response of a number
of lightly damped single-degree-of-freedom systems using a dynamic amplifica-
tion factor Q of 10 at the resonant frequency. This shock response spectrum is
determined at frequency intervals of one-sixth octave band or less over a frequency
range of 100 to 10,000 Hz. A typical shock response is shown in Fig. 10.21.
10.3.1.10 Ambient temperature. In-flight temperatures are discussed in
Chapter 7. In general, ground ambient temperatures are controlled as necessary
to ensure that they do not drive the design of space hardware. Typical ground
handling temperature limits are as follows: storage, 50 to 80°F; factory, 67 to
77°F; transportation, 60 to 80°F; launch site, 25 to 100°F.
10.3.2 Materials
Based on the specific requirements for the structural element under design con-
sideration, one material type may have advantages over another. By far the most
common material used on spacecraft is aluminum. It is found in many alloys and
tempers, it is lightweight, easy to machine, weld, and handle, and offers significant
structural advantages over other materials. Alloy steels, stainless steels, nickel-
based alloys, magnesium, beryllium, titanium, reinforced plastics, and composites
are almost always found on spacecraft as structural elements.

specification, treatment, and thickness you are using. The sheet properties shown
are for the thinner gauges.
Materials are most often selected based on their physical properties with respect
to weight. In particular, the ratios E/p (stiffness) and Ftu/p (strength) are the
most common. Figure 10.22 compares common structural materials on the basis
of strength/weight and stiffness/weight.
The metals steel, titanium, aluminum, and magnesium all have approximately
the same stiffness ratio. If the structural element's stiffness is linear with thickness,
as in an axial strut member, none of the four materials provides an advantage over
the other. If the stiffness is linear with thickness squared or cubed, as in a beam
element, lighter materials, such as aluminum, offer significant weight savings.
Because of its corrosion susceptibility, magnesium is rarely used. Other materi-
als such as beryllium and composites offer E/p ratios well in excess of most other
metals, but may be eliminated because of cost or toxicity problems. The Ftu/p
ratio can vary a lot, not only from material to material, but also as a function of
alloy elements, heat treat, and cold work. Few steels are three times as strong as
aluminum, although aluminum is only one-third the density of steel. Titanium, on
the other hand, can be three times as strong as aluminum with only 1.6 times its
density.
Composites can be specifically tailored to obtain the particular mechanical
properties required. Table 10.3 summarizes the properties of two typical composite
materials.
Preliminary loads and stress analysis are performed in the preliminary design
phase. Rough calculations of mass properties and member sizes are required.

Some preliminary testing of hardware can be performed to verify its structural or
functional adequacy, for example, fracture toughness testing of thick plates and
structural bond strength testing of composites.
10.3.3 Loads Analysis
Limit loads and pressures, which are the maximums expected to act on a structure
throughout its service life, are determined for 1) the basis of structural design and
2) as the basis for the loads to be applied in structural proof, ultimate, and life
strength testing. Limit loads are determined for all structural elements and for
every potentially critical loading condition likely to be encountered in the life of
the structure. This section defines the loads combination process for determining
structural limit loads.
Limit loads are defined by load environment, loadpath, mass properties, and
load uncertainty factors. This interrelation is shown in Fig. 10.23.

10.3.3.1 Loads uncertainty factor. A loads uncertainty factor is applied to
the primary structure's low-frequency transient loads to compensate for unknowns
pertaining to the coupling effects of a launch vehicle and payload. These factors
are defined in Table 10.4.
10.3.3.2 Mass properties. The application of the worst-case combination
of load factors to the design mass properties constitutes the predicted load con-
dition. Design mass properties should include contingency mass and unallocated
margin in a worst-case manner for loads and or frequency.
10.3.3.3 Primary structure loads. Primary structure is defined as any
structure, the failure of which would result in the general failure of the spacecraft.
For example, the launch vehicle adapter is a primary structure. Primary structure
is analyzed for liftoff/ascent environment plus the loads from supported mass. The
lateral loads are applied simultaneously with the axial loads in all possible sign
combinations. Lateral loads are applied in the worst-case direction.
10.3.3.4 Secondary structure loads. Secondary structure is defined
structure, the failure of which would not result in failure of the mission nor in
substantial limit of objectives. Secondary structure is loaded mainly by vibro-
acoustic loads. In preliminary design secondary structure can be analyzed in two
major ways as shown in Fig. 10.24.
10.3.3.5 Option 1—Mass acceleration curve. A mass acceleration curve
(MAC) represents the upper bound on acceleration for a given component/structure
mass. The MAC curve is presented as g as a function of item mass (physical MAC)
or modal mass (modal MAC) and is typically developed from load cycle data and
models for a particular launch vehicle/upper-stage combination and a payload
"similar" to the payload being designed.
The physical MAC load factor is generally applied in a single worst-case axis
of the item being analyzed. The launch vehicle thrust is added to the MAC load
factor. The physical MAC load factor should also be combined with any other loads
(pressure, thermal, misalignment, etc.) present. When using the physical MAC,
the support structure should be checked at its own weight plus the supported
weight at the predicted acceleration. The modal MAC (Fig. 10.25) is generally

applied to a spacecraft or component modal model in each of the three orthogonal
axes and root sum squared with the modal portion. That result is added to the
steady-state loads in the launch vehicle thrust (axial) direction. The modal MAC
loads should also be combined with other loads (pressure, thermal, misalignment,
etc.).

random vibration loads or load factors can be combined with steady-state loads or
load factors in a rss fashion, as shown in Table 10.5. To completely analyze the
hardware, all three cases in Table 10.5 must be analyzed. These loads need to be
applied in all possible combinations with the lateral loads to generate the worst-
case stresses. Depending on model fidelity, the portion of the load from the launch
vehicle steady state and transient environment can be superseded by load cycle re-
sults. For secondary structure a maximum cutoff of three times the overall spectrum
GRMS is acceptable for computing the random vibration loads or load factors.

load or load factor; /?/ the acceptance level random vibration load or load factor
from Mile's equation or equivalent (may be limited to three times the overall spec-
trum GRMS); and Oi the other load or load factor (thermal, pressure, misalignment,
etc.).
10.3.3.7 Tertiary structure loads. Tertiary structure is defined as can-
tilevered components and the support structure (if any) for these components.
Electronics boards are also classified as tertiary structure. Tertiary structure is
loaded mainly by vibroacoustic loads. In a manner similar to secondary structure,
tertiary structure will be analyzed per one of the options shown in Fig. 10.24.
The main difference in the analysis of secondary and tertiary structure is in the
treatment of random vibration loading. For tertiary structure no cutoff value is
permitted for computing random vibration loads in option 2.
10.3.3.8 Acoustically excited structure. Large surface area, lightweight
structures are susceptible to excitation as a result of acoustic energy impinge-
ment. For preliminary analysis of these structures, launch loads are combined with
acoustic loads as shown in Table 10.6.
These load factors need to be applied in all possible sign combinations with the
lateral loads applied in the direction to generate the worst-case stresses. Depending
on model fidelity, the portion of the load from the launch vehicle steady state and
transient environment can be superseded by load cycle results.

load or load factor; A/ the acceptance level acoustic load or load factor; and <9/

70.3.4 Stress Analysis
Virtually all failure criteria for structures can be thought of in terms of deforma-
tion. For instance, crushing, buckling, crack growth, stretching, bending, twisting,
and bursting can all be thought of as geometric deformations that exceed some
acceptable limit. For example, stretching beyond a materials elastic limit might
occur so that it remains plastically deformed. If this is considered unacceptable
to the mission, the structure will have failed and must be redesigned. Sometimes
elastic deformations can be excessive. Most modern buildings and bridges are de-
signed to limit elastic deflection. Displacement is the critical failure condition for

floors, which cannot bend too much before the occupants "feel" uncomfortable,
and for tall buildings, which dynamically sway in the wind and can make occupants
nauseous. Similarly, spacecraft structures must limit elastic deformation so that
parts do not bump together either as a result of mechanical force or thermal defor-
mation. The most critical condition for many modern spacecraft designs is to make
sure structural frequencies are above a certain threshold. Below this value structural
resonances can occur, which can cause extremely large loads and destruction of
hardware. Stiff designs prevent resonances with launch vehicle forcing functions,
but stiff structures get heavy. Another option is load isolation systems are designed
to have one fundamental frequency, which is designed to be separate from all load
frequencies. This can dramatically reduce loads, but also increases deflections.
Once the geometric deformation criteria are understood, the applied loads are
related to the failure criteria. This cannot be done directly except by test. By
analysis, the deformation is converted to strain in the materials using the part
geometries. For instance, in a column, the deflection on a column of length /
causes a strain d/l. Similarly, in a beam, the deflection is measured as curvature or
p, and the strain isy/p, where y is the original depth of the beam (independent of
length). But in a beam it is often easier to calculate the stretch or contraction in the
extreme fibers (top or bottom) and compare that to the original length to calculate
strain. This approach works for pressure vessels and other structures as well.
By analysis, strains can be converted into stresses using the elastic/plastic ma-
terial properties such as Young's modulus. For most materials, stress = E*strain,
where E = Young's modulus, which is the slope of the linearly elastic portion of
a material's stress/strain curve. For advanced composite materials that are brittle,

that is, have no plasticity, stress is all we care about. For most metals that have sig-
nificant plasticity, it is sometimes acceptable to take advantage of the tremendous
energy absorbing capability beyond the elastic limit. For instance, some steels have
more than 50% strain at failure and up to 100 times the energy absorbing capabil-
ity as compared to the elastic region only. This makes most metals much safer to
work with—there is much more strain available than is normally accounted for.
Unfortunately, once a material is strained into the plastic deformation region, by
definition, it does not return to its original state. And "bent up" structure is usually
not acceptable. Thus, plastic materials are treated the same as brittle materials in
most analyses. Exceptions include susceptibility to handling damage and cyclic
load resistance, as explained later in this chapter.
Once loads are understood, stress analysis converts loads into stress by under-
standing 1) load magnitudes, 2) load frequencies, 3) load distributions on the struc-
ture, 4) how the load is transmitted through the structure (analysis of load paths),
and 5) geometry of the structure. Often complex mathematical models are used to
perform this series of tasks. Many books have been written on methods of perform-
ing this analysis, and many aerospace companies have developed rules on how to
perform this operation. These steps will be addressed later in this chapter.
To better understand, manufacture, and analyze the structure, it is decomposed
into structural elements that are easily understood, such as beams (tubes, bars,
I-beams, or other cross sections), struts, plates, columns, shear panels, pressure
vessels, stiffeners, stringers, ring frames, boxes, lands, bosses, lugs, intercostals,
and many other structural member types.
10.3.4.1 Simplifying assumptions. The common simplifying assumptions
in stress analysis are 1) small deflections, 2) linear stress vs strain relationship,
3) structure idealized as either beam or plate, 4) symmetry taken advantage of,
5) lightweight secondary structure ignored, and 6) structure idealized as statically
determinant.
10.3.4.2 Force resolution. Forces and moments can be represented by vec-
tors: position indicates direction and point of origin; length represents magnitude.
Moments are represented by a vector perpendicular to the plane in which they are
acting.
Parallel forces acting in opposite directions separated by a distance d produce
a moment M — Fd. The moment M is represented by a vector M, which can be
spatially located with the right-hand rule. Vector mechanics applies to forces and
moments:
1) Any number of concurrent forces can be resolved into a single resultant force.
2) Any number of concurrent moments can be resolved into a single resultant
moment.
3) Any number of nonconcurrent forces and moments can be resolved into a
single force and a single moment.

10.3.4.3 Force equilibrium. All six degrees of freedom of a body, or a
point, must be in dynamic equilibrium at all times. All forces must balance in
accordance with the following rules:
^-dir = Fxi + FX2 + - - . + FXn = max
and for static equilibrium
max = 0(10.7)
(10.8)
where FX.^Y is the sum of the forces in the x direction, m the mass, and ax the
acceleration in the x direction.
Clearly Eqs. (10.7) and (10.8) can be written for the y direction and the
z direction as well. For moments

convenient to isolate that piece of structure and to resolve all of the forces acting
on it to demonstrate static or dynamic equilibrium. Figure 10.28 shows examples.

is stable and the reactions on the free body can be calculated using geometry only;
structural stiffness is not required. A structure is indeterminate if more reactions
are available on the free-body diagram than the minimum that are required to
calculate their magnitudes. Structural stiffness must be employed to solve for the
reactions.

one applied load can be added (superposed) to another. The result is the same as
if both loads were simultaneously applied.

engineering elements, including areas, masses, etc. Those of particular interest to
the stress analyst describe the cross-sectional properties of a beam or bar. The first
and second area moments are the most important for shear and bending analysis.
The first moment of area is

where
M = first moment of area
yi — linear distance from the reference axis to the centroid of area A,
jo = linear distance from the reference axis to the centroid of the total area A
AI = an elemental area
A = total area of the section
The second moment of area, or area moment of inertia 7, is
I = Ay2Q (10.15)
These moments are calculated about the neutral axis, the axis around which the
bending stress is zero; the neutral axis of a section subject to bending only passes
through the centroid. The neutral axis location is

x direction, the moment of inertia about its neutral axis is

Equation (10.18) is useful for calculating area moment of inertia for complex
sections. The sign in Eq. (10.18) is negative if axis 2 is closer to the neutral axis
than axis 1.
The section properties of a hollow figure are obtained by subtracting the moment
of inertia of the hole from the moment of inertia of the complete figure. For example,
a hollow rectangular shape h\, b\ with a hole measuring hi,bi has a moment of
inertia of

with respect to an x-x axis located as shown in Fig 10.22.
Example 10.2 Beam Section Properties
Consider the simplified I-beam cross section shown in Fig. 10.29.
The steps in solving for the beam section properties are as follows:
1) Divide the beam into three rectangular sections A, B, and C.
2) Calculate the area of each rectangle.
3) Calculate the moment of inertia for each rectangle from IQG = bh3/12.
4) Calculate elemental Ixx from Ixx = 7Co + Aiyf.
5) Calculate beam neutral axis location from vna = SA/J//EA/.
6) Calculate section 7na from 7na = Ixx — Ay^a.
The calculations are shown in Table 10.10.

two simple supports as shown in Fig. 10.31. The sum of the vertical shear at any

where V(a) is the vertical shear at any section. The shear is positive when the
vertical forces on one side of the section tends to move upward. A section of a
beam is always normal to the long axis. In calculating shear, the reactions must be
considered as applied loads.
The bending moment M(a) at any section is equal to the sum of the moments
caused by all of the forces on one side of the section:

The beam will have compression stresses on one side and tension stresses on the
other. It might require two analyses to determine the lowest margin.
In the preceding example we assumed that stress governed the design; however,
stiffness requirements (natural frequency or allowable deflection) may govern.

Assume the beam is an aluminum tube with the following properties: Ftu is the
ultimate tensile stress = 70 ksi; Fty is the yield stress in tension = 60 ksi; Fsu is
the ultimate shear stress = 45 ksi; and E is the Young's modulus = 107 psi.

10.3.4.9 Forces in truss members. For purposes of analysis, it is assumed
that trusses consist of straight bars connected at their ends with frictionless pins
and that all loads enter the truss at pin joints. Under these idealized conditions the
stress in the members is either tension or compression, without bending or torsion.
The tension and compression in truss members derived from analysis are called
primary stresses. The stresses caused by riveted end joints and nonideal pin joints
are called secondary stresses. The following discussion deals only with primary
stresses.
The general procedure for analysis of an ideal truss is as follows:
1) Define all loads and reactions on the truss.
2) Determine the stresses in any member by the following:

STRUCTURES 551
a) Take a section, an imaginary cut through the truss, including the member
being analyzed, which divides the truss into two pieces.
b) Isolate either of these pieces.
c) Replace each cut member with a force representing the stress in the
member or the force existing in the piece that was removed.
d) Use summation of forces and moments to evaluate the stress in the cut bar
or bars.
Assume either tension or compression in analyzing a member; if the force comes
out negative, reverse the assumption.

10.3.4.10 Instability. Structure with a relatively low stiff ness-to-strength
ratio is subject to failure by buckling or crippling. Examples are column buckling,
web shear buckling, and thin-walled tube collapse.
10.3.4.11 Energy analysis. To calculate deflections and to analyze stati-
cally indeterminate structures, the stiffness of the hardware must be known and
used in analysis. Thus, not only forces but also deflections must be calculated.
When both of these are used, the strain energy must be minimized to solve the
problem. These methods are also called work methods because work is twice the
strain energy:

and
Strain Energy = asdV (10.29)

10.3.4.12 Equivalent axial load. When analyzing large diameter thin-
walled tubes, the moment plus axial load effect can be expressed as a single
term—the equivalent axial load Pe. The equivalent axial load is calculated by con-
verting the stress from the moment into an axial stress and then into an axial load:
Pe = fA = ^-A (10.31)
Pt = ^^ (10.32)nr5t
Pe = 2— (10.33)r

10.3.4.13 Factor of safety. Factor of safety relates limit load to the strength
of the part. Factor of safety accounts for uncertainty in the loads, analysis methods,
and materials strength. Higher safety factors give greater conservatism. Factor of
safety can be given with respect to the yield strength or to the ultimate strength.
Typical examples are given in Table 10.11.
Government organizations and aerospace companies all have their own stan-
dards for what factor of safety will be used under any given condition.

capability of a part remaining after applying limit load.
Allowable load (or stress)MS = ——————————————-—————-———— (10.34)(Factor of safety) [Limit load (or stress)]
Structural integrity of flight structures can be verified by analysis alone or by a
combination of analysis and test.
10.3.4.15 Material strength properties. Conventional material strengths
and a wealth of other mechanical and physical properties are contained in MIL-
HDBK-5.4 Use of material properties from this source is normally a contract
requirement. Where values for desired materials are not available, they must be
determined by test. Test procedures are also set forth in MIL-HDBK-5.
Material strength in MIL-HDBK-5 is designated as A-basis, B-basis, or S-basis.
A-basis and B -basis values are based on statistical evaluation of controlled and
reported test results. Values, which are based on undocumented data, are classified
as S-basis. It is clearly desirable to use A-basis allowables, particularly in flight-
critical structure.
10.3.4.16 Strength properties of advanced structural materials. Many
composite materials have not been characterized sufficiently to establish A- or
B -basis properties. Extensive testing and higher safety factors are needed to use
these materials.

STRUCTURES 555
10.3.4.17 Fracture mechanics. Fracture mechanics is a method of ana-
lyzing structures to verify that they are safe for the entire mission life. All materials
are assumed to be flawed, and the analysis verifies that the largest flaw that cannot
be detected by inspection or proof test will not grow to an unstable size and cause
failure of the hardware.
10.3.4.18 Margin of safety. The structural margin of safety is based on
theoretical analysis and substantiated by test. The margins so determined are used
as final indicators of available strength or adequate stiffness. Margin of safety must
be greater than or equal to zero and reflect the most critical mode of failure and
whether the structure is yield, ultimate, or deflection critical.
10.3.4.19 Stress concentrations. The distribution of stress across the ef-
fective cross-sectional area of a structural element is nominally uniform. Any
irregularities, however, such as abrupt changes in section, notches, or holes, cause
stresses to increase locally at those points. These increases can be several times the
nominal stress. Similarly, application of loading is localized in many cases, and
stress patterns are disturbed by eccentricities or discontinuities. Stress concentra-
tion factors are applied in these cases.
10.3.4.20 Fasteners. The allowable strengths for fasteners are also obtai-
ned from MIL-HDBK-5.4 Where special fasteners are required, allowable strengths
must be obtained from vendor data or from tests. Fasteners with an ultimate tensile
strength of 160 ksi are preferred for their thread life characteristics over both
lower and higher strength fasteners. Cold rolled threads with the MIL-S-8879
UNJ thread form are preferred for thread life for all structural fasteners. A positive
locking feature other than preload induced friction is required on all flight hardware
fasteners.
10.4 Mechanisms
Detailed design of mechanisms is a highly specialized field and is well beyond
the scope of this book. In this section the types of mechanisms that are used on
spacecraft are discussed along with examples. In the early design phases it is
adequate to isolate the functions that mechanisms will be required to perform, to
select a general type of mechanism, and tabulate mass and power requirements.
Table 10.12 lists the functions of spacecraft mechanisms from several spacecraft
programs.
Table 10.12 shows that the requirement for mechanisms are derived from the
following: 1) the actions necessary to convert the stowed, or launch, configuration
into the cruise configuration; 2) the articulation required for solar panels, antennas,
and science instruments; 3) the actions necessary to transfer power from articulat-
ing solar panels to fixed body; 4) the staging processes; and 5) dual spinning, for
example, spin-bearing assemblies. Note that the functions in Table 10.12 can be di-
vided into one-time functions, such as stage separation, and continuous functions,
such as scan platform pointing. This distinction makes a significant difference in
the mechanism design approach.

As shown in Table 10.12, the mechanism requirements for a spinning spacecraft
are different than for a three-axis-stabilized machine. Dual spinners require a
multifunction spin-bearing assembly between the fixed and spinning segments.
Spinners normally do not require solar-panel deployment, articulation, or power
transfer. One of the major advantages of spinners is that scanning instruments can
be accommodated without mechanisms.
The severity of the launch vehicle shroud constraints determine the complexity
of the deployment process.
INTELSAT VI has nested deployment of the antennas and feeds on the upper
deck, which entails sequenced deployments each of which must be successful
before the next can be started.8 Spacecraft with a kick stage typically have two
separation functions: one from the launch vehicle and one from the spent kick
stage. Magellan, Voyager, and PVO are examples of this situation.
Mechanisms are a major source of in-flight spacecraft failures because of the
following:
1) The design of mechanisms is largely empirical.
2) Mechanisms are normally custom designed for each spacecraft and do not
have a flight history.
3) It is difficult and imprecise to test space mechanisms in a laboratory environ-
ment with gravity and the atmosphere.
A major objective of the early design work on a spacecraft is to minimize the
mechanisms required.

10.4.1 Common Mechanisms
The design of mechanisms is a specialty field in itself. An excellent detailed
engineering text on spacecraft mechanism design is NASA Space Mechanism
Handbook9, edited by R. L. Fusaro. The design, analysis, and test of mechanisms
use MIL-A-83577B as a guide. The following paragraphs are a general survey of
some common spacecraft mechanisms.
10.4.1.1 Squibs. The most elemental ordnance device is a squib or an
initiator, which is used to activate a mechanism such as an explosive nut or an
ordnance valve. In a squib electrical energy is used to heat bridge wires (some
have dual bridge wires) that ignite an explosive train, which in turn releases a
burst of gas at high temperature. NASA now has a standard initiator (NSI) for this
purpose.
10.4.1.2 Ordnance devices. Ordnance devices use chemical energy from
an initiator to actuate a one-time-use mechanism. Table 10.13 lists common ord-
nance devices.
Explosive bolts and explosive nuts are functionally interchangeable; either de-
stroys the tension carrying capability of a nut/bolt combination. Explosive nuts
generally cause less shock to adjacent equipment.
Ordnance devices are empirical designs; high design margins and statistical
testing are used as a result. It is common practice to use redundant devices, each
with redundant squibs, and design each device to operate properly with less than
half the gas pressure from one squib.
10.4.1.3 Solar-panel deployment. Solar-panel deployment is usually ac-
complished by use of a spring-loaded hinge, which is released by an ordnance

device. The Magellan solar-panel deployment method is typical for three-axis-
stabilized spacecraft (see Fig. 10.39). For launch the solar panels were stowed
folded downward and latched in position with explosive pins at the midpoint.
There are spring-loaded hinges located at the bus attachment point; the hinge
mechanism is shown in Fig. 10.39. When the panel was released by the pin
pullers, the springs raised the panels into the flight position where they were
locked in place. There is a microswitch in each mechanism to verify the deployed
and latched condition. When the panels were deployed in flight, there was no
initial indication of panels latched. When the IUS stage I ignited, both panels
latched.
10.4.1.4 Solar-panel articulation. Unless the spacecraft is sun-oriented,
the solar panels must be articulated in one or two axes to keep the panels normal to
the sun. The Magellan mission was designed such that one axis of rotation would
be adequate; spacecraft rotation provided the second axis. The mechanism has
two components: 1) a rotation mechanism, which was a motor/bearing set, and
2) a cable wrap system, which controlled the wrap and unwrap of the power cable
as the panel was rotated. The cable wrap assembly contained 55 in. of cable and
provided for 350 deg of rotation. As an alternative to the cable wrap mechanism,
a slip ring mechanism could have performed the same function. The stepper drive
motor has an integral potentiometer to provide position information. The Magellan
deployment and rotation mechanism weighed 13.8 kg (each).
Magellan was designed for a single mechanism to provide deployment and
one-axis rotation; clearly two separate mechanisms could have been used.

10.4.1.5 Folded solar panels. The general arrangement of some space-
craft requires solar-panel folding to accommodate the launch vehicle shroud. Mars
Observer, shown in Fig. 10.40, is an example of a folded-panel configuration.
Figure 10.40a shows the spacecraft in the stowed configuration with the six-
segment solar array completely folded. Figure 10.40b shows the spacecraft cruise
configuration with the solar panel partially unfolded. Figure 10.40c shows the
mapping configuration in Mars orbit with the panel completely deployed.
The six panels and a two-section solar-panel boom were folded into the launch
position and restrained by cables. At each of the two deployments, the appropriate
panel segments and boom segments were released by redundant cable cutters.
Spring-loaded hinges drove the segments into the deployed positions. The velocity
of the deploying segments was controlled by passive dampers.
10.4.1.6 Spring-driven hinges. Spring-driven hinges are common
mechanisms as evidenced by the Magellan, Mars Observer, and INTELSAT VI.
Figure 10.41 shows the INTELSAT VI viscous-damped, spring-driven hinge,
which is used in five different mechanisms on the spacecraft.
A minimum motor torque three times the maximum operating torque (200%
margin) is good design practice and a requirement on INTELSAT vehicles. With
high torque, damping is often required to reduce the latch-up velocity of the mech-
anism. The drive shaft is pinned to a fixed structure; the housing is attached to
the driven structure. The deployment spring imparts a constant torque to the

560 ELEMENTS OF SPACECRAFT DESIGN
housing, The housing rotates relative to the shaft, forcing fluid (Dow Corning
200) through the main gap at a controlled rate. Near the end of the stroke, the
main gap decreases, forcing a reduction in rotational velocity. Because fluid
viscosity is a function of temperature, the temperature of the mechanism must
be within temperature limits prior to initiating deployment. This hinge design
incorporates redundant micros witches to verify successful deployment.8 Redun-
dant microswitches are highly desirable in order to differentiate between a mech-
anism failure and a micros witch failure.
10.4.1.7 Launch locks. Dual-spin spacecraft require launch locks to fix the
spun and despun sections during the launch process. Releasing the launch locks
is part of the deployment process. INTELSAT VI, for example, had four launch
locks installed at 90-deg intervals of the despun shelf. The latches were released
by explosive bolt despun segments.8
10.4.1.8 Spin-bearing mechanism. Dual-spin spacecraft require a multi-
function spin-bearing assembly between the spun and despun sections. The func-
tions of the assembly are to 1) maintain the proper rotation rate between the two
sections, 2) transfer power, and 3) transfer signals. Rotation rate is maintained
by electric motors. Slip rings transfer power and signals across the interface.
INTELSAT VI used redundant 24-pole dc motors each developing 4.8 N-m torque.
If required, both motors can be operated simultaneously, doubling the torque. The
slip ring assembly contained 44 signal slip rings and 4 power slip rings. The power
transfer capacity is 2000 W.8
10.4.1.9 Staging mechanisms. There are three basic approaches to stag-
ing separation:
1) Hold the staging interface together with either explosive nuts or bolts. To
stage, blow the ordnance. This is a simple approach with much flight history. It is
best suited for a structure designed for point loads, for example, a truss.
2) Hold the staging interface together with a two- or three-segment clamp with
the segments held together by explosive nuts. This method is well suited for an
interface with distributed loads, for example, a shell structure or a solid rocket
motor case.
3) Use Super-Zip™ technique, also best for shell structure. In this technique a
linear-shaped charge is built into the interface structure at the staging plane. When
the ordnance is fired, the structure fractures all of the way around the shell at the
interface plane (like a zipper). After the interstage structure is split, by whatever
means, balanced, calibrated springs are used to force a small positive separation
velocity with minimal overturning moment.
10.4.1.10 Scan platforms. Scan platforms are required when pointing re-
quirements exceed (or conflict with) the maneuvering capability of the spacecraft.
Supporting a narrow-angle camera requires a scan platform. The Voyager space-
craft, which produced such impressive images of the outer planets, is a good
illustration of the successful use of a scan platform. During each encounter, while

the spacecraft points the large parabolic high-gain antenna at Earth, a set of sensors
must be accurately aimed at a succession of objects of scientific interest. To accom-
plish this, the cameras as well as the sensors for infrared radiation, polarimetry, and
UV spectroscopy were mounted on a scan platform, which is shown on the right in
Fig. 10.41.
The scan platform can be precisely pointed around two axes. The instruments
are mounted on the platform with a common boresight. The total gimbaled mass is
102.5 kg (226 Ib). Driver circuits for the scan motors, one for each axis, are located
in the ACS electronics and commanded by the ACS computer. The angular range
is 360 deg in azimuth and 210 deg in elevation. The platform is slewed one axis at
a time with selectable slew rates, which are 0.083 deg/s and 0.0052 deg/s. Camera
line of sight is controlled to within 2.5 mrad.
The scan platform was stowed for launch with a set of two, one-axis deployment
hinge mechanisms visible in the platform truss near the high-gain antenna in
Fig. 10.41.
10.4.1.11 Booms. A number of instruments, notably magnetometers, re-
quire booms in order for the measurements to be free from the influence of the
spacecraft. The booms extend to the deployed position after spacecraft separation;
some require retraction as well. The three common types of booms are shown in
Table 10.14.
Figure 10.41 shows the 13-m deploy able Astromast (Astro Aerospace,
Carpinteria, California). It is a common deploy able boom used on Voyager, Galileo,
and Cassini. This boom is stowed inside a canister only 23 cm in diameter and
66 cm long. The Astromast is a triangular truss with fiberglass longitudinal mem-
bers held in place by fiberglass triangles that are spaced 14 cm apart. The truss is
stiffened by tensioned, collapsible diagonal filaments. Releasing the canister lid
allows the boom to deploy like a jack-in-the-box.
The boom is stowed by twisting the entire structure so that the diagonal filaments
and triangles are nearly in contact with each other. This stores a considerable elastic
energy in the assembly. When the canister is opened by an ordnance device, a
lanyard is played out, which controls the velocity of extension.10
The Viking soil sample boom is a de Havilland type boom, which is frequently
used for deployment of antennas or instruments. The de Havilland boom is made
from a strip of beryllium copper that is heat treated in a tubular form. The strip
is then flattened and rolled into a coil. When it is deployed, the strip is unwound
through a flat-to-tubular guide where the original tubular shape is recovered. A
fairly rigid sensor support or whip antenna results. (The action is similar to that
of a carpenter's steel tape measure.) The Viking lander used a variant on the de
Havilland boom to extend and retract the soil sample collector. The boom, when
extended, was a spring steel tube with two extended flanges (see Fig. 10.42). The
flanges contained a series of sprocket holes that were used by the spool in the
extend/retract mechanism. During the process, the tube was pressed flat, thereby
losing its stiffness.
The boom mechanism provided three-axis articulation as well as extension and
retraction for the soil sampler. The boom could be extended 10 ft and rotated
108 deg, covering about 130 ft2 of the surface in front of the lander.

B.2 Mass Estimating and Budgeting
This section contains weight-estimating relationships that can be used for very
early estimates of on-orbit dry mass. These relationships are based on statistics
from prior spacecraft. Note that estimating relationships based on history, by def-
inition, do not reflect the latest state of the art. Figure B.I shows the on-orbit dry
mass of seven geosynchronous communication satellites as a function of payload
mass.
A JPL study of 46 Earth-orbiting navigation, communications, meteorology,
Earth resources, and astronomy spacecraft showed that the on-orbit dry mass was
bounded by the limits of 3 and 7 times the payload mass with the average ratio
being 4.8; Fig. B.2.
Figure B.3 shows planetary spacecraft on-orbit dry mass vs payload mass for
11 planetary spacecraft.
The classes of design listed in Table B.5 are class 1: a new spacecraft (one of a
kind, first generation); class 2: the next generation spacecraft based on a previously
developed family, which expands in complexity or capability within an established
design envelope; and class 3: a production-level development based on an existing
design for which multiple units are planned and where a significant amount of
standardization exists.
In Table B.6, for communication satellites, telecommunication is not shown
separately; it is included in the CDS mass. The subsystem weights are shown as
percentages of spacecraft dry weight.

APPENDIX B: SPACECRAFT DESIGN DATA 591
Design maturity is expressed in Table B.9 as a function of the major reviews
conducted during a design: the bid (proposal or bid stage), CoDR (conceptual
design review), PDR (preliminary design review), CDR (critical design review),
PRR (preship readiness review), and FRR (flight readiness review).
The classes of design listed in Table B.9 are class 1: a new spacecraft (one of a
kind first generation); class 2: the next generation spacecraft based on a previously
developed family, which expands in complexity or capability within an established
design envelope; and class 3: a production-level development based on an existing
design for which multiple units are planned and where a significant amount of
standardization exists.
