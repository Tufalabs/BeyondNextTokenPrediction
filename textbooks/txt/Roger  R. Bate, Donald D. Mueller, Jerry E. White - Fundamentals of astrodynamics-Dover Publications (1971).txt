FUNDAMENTALS OF 
ASTRODYNAMICS 
Roger R. Bate 
Donald D. Mueller Jerry E. White 
When the United States Air Force Academy began teaching astro· 
dynamics to undergraduates majoring in astronautics or aerospace 
engineering, it found that the traditional approach to the subject 
was well over 100 years old. An entirely new text had to be evolved, 
geared to the use of high speed digital computers and actual current 
practice in industry. Over the years the new approach was proven 
in the classrooms of the Academy; its students entering graduate 
engineering schools were found to possess a better understanding of 
astrodynamics than others. So pressing is the need for superior 
training in the aerospace sciences that the professor·authors of this 
text decided to publish it for other institutions' use. This new Dover 
publication is the result. 
The text is structured for teaching. Central emphasis is on use of 
the universal variable formulation, although classical methods are 
discussed. Several original unpublished derivations are included. 
A foundation for all that follows is the development of the basic 
two-body and nobody equations of motion; orbit determination is 
then treated, and the classical orbital elements, coordinate trans­
formations, and differential correction. Orbital transfer maneuvers 
are developed, followed by time-of-flight with emphasis on the uni­
versal variable solution. The Kepler and Gauss problems are treated 
in detail. Two-body mechanics are applied to the ballistic missile 
problem, including launch error analysis and targeting on a rotating 
earth. Some further specialized applications are made to lunar and 
interplanetary flight, followed by an introduction to perturbation, 
special perturbations, integration schemes and errors, and analytic 
formulations of several common perturbations. 
Example problems are used frequently, while exercises at the end of 
each chapter include derivations and quantitative and qualitative 
problems. The authors suggest how to use the text for a first course 
in astrodynamics or for a two course sequence. 
This new major instructional tool effectively communicates the sub­
ject to engineering students in a manner found in no other textbook. 
Its efficiency has been thoroughly demonstrated. The publishers 
feel privileged in joining with the authors to make its concepts and 
text matter available to other faculties. 
A new work, first published by Dover in 1971. Profusely illustrated 
with photographs, diagrams, line drawings, etc. Four appendices:

sions," "Vector Revie,·,," and "Suggested Projects:' Index. xii +

PREFACE 
The study of astrodynamics is becoming a common prerequisite for 
any engineer or scientist who expects to be involved in the aerospace 
sciences and their many applications. While manned travel in 
Earth-Moon space is becoming more common, we are also 
concentrating on sophisticated applications of Earth and interplanetary 
satellites in the fields of communicat ions, navigation, and basic 
research. 
Even the use of satellites simply as transport vehicles or platforihs for 
experime nts requires a fundamental understanding of astrodynamics. 
We also recognize that for some time to come the ballistic missile, 
whose mechanics of flight has its foundation in astrodynamics, will be 
a front-line weapon in the arsenals of many co untries. 
Beginning with the first graduating class of 1959 the United States 
Air Force Academy has been in the forefront of astrodynamics 
education. Much has been learned from this experience concerning both 
the structure of the courses and what theoretical approaches are best 
for teaching the subject. Consequently, this text is particularly 
structured for teaching, rather than as an exhaustive treatment of 
astrodynamics. 
The astrodynamic theory is presented with brief historical 
digressions. Although many classical methods are discussed, the central 
emphasis is on the use of the universal variable formulation. The 
theoretical development is rigorous but yet readable and usable. Several 
unpublished original derivations are included in the text. Example 
problems are used frequently to show the student how the theory can 
be applied. Exercises at the end of each chapter include derivations and 
quantitative and qualitative problems. Their difficulty ranges from 
straightforward to difficult. Difficult problems are marked with an

asterisk (*). In addition to exercises at the end of each chapter, 
Appendix D includes several projects which are appropriate for a 
second course. 
Chapter 1 develops the foundation for the rest of the book in the 
development of the basic two-body and n-body equations of motion. 
Chapter 2 treats orbit determination from various types of 
observations. It also introduces the classical orbital elements, 
coordinate transformations, the non-spherical earth, and differential 
correction. Chapter 3 then develops orbital transfer maneuver s such as 
the Hohmann transfer. Chapters 4 and 5 introduce time-of-flight with 
emphasis on the universal variable solution. These chapters treat the 
classical Kepler and Gauss problems in detail. Chapter 6 discusses the 
application of two-body mechanics to the ballistic missile problem, 
including launch error analysis and targeting on a rotating earth. 
Chapters 7 and 8 are further specialized applications to lunar and 
interplanetary flight. Chapter 9 is a brief introduction to perturbation 
analysis emphasizing special perturbations. It also includes a discussion 
of integration schemes and errors and analytic formulations of several 
common perturbations. 
If the text is used for a first course in astrodynamics, the following 
sequence is suggested: Chapter 1, Chapter 2 (sections 2.1 through 2.7, 
2.13 through 2.15), Chapter 3, Chapter 4 (sections 4.1 through 4.5), 
Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 or 8. A first course could include Project 
SITE/TRACK or Project PREDICT in Appendix D. A second course 
could be structured as follows: Chapter 2 (sections 2.8 through 2.12), 
review the Kepler problem of Chapter 4 and do Project KEPLER, 
Chapter 5 including projects GAUSS and INTERCEPT, and Chapter 9. 
Contributions to the ideas and methods of this text have been made 
by many present and former members of the Department of 
Astronautics and Computer Science. Special mention should be made 
of the computer applications developed by Colonel Richard G. Rumney 
and Lieutenant Colonel Delbert Jacobs. The authors wish to

CHAPTER 1 
TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANICS 
On �hristmas Day, 1642, the year Galileo died, there was 
born in the Manor House ofWoolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth a 
male infant so tiny that, as his mother told him in later 
years, he might have been put into a quart mug, and so frail 
that he had to wear a bolster around his neck to support his 
head. This unfortunate creature was entered in the parish 
register as 'Isaac sonne of Isaac and Hanna Newton.' There is 
no record that the wise men honored the occasion, yet this 
child was to alter the thought and habit of the world. 
-JarnesR. Newman! 
1.1 mSTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIC LAWS 
If Christmas Day 1642 ushered in the age of reason it was only because 
two men, Tycho Brahe and Johann Kepler, who chanced to meet only 18 
months before the former's death, laid the groundwork for Newton's 
greatest discoveries some 50 years later. 
It would be difficult to imagine a greater contrast between two men 
working in the same field of science than existed between Tycho Brahe 
and Kepler. 
Tycho, the noble and aristocratic Dane, was exceptional in mechanical 
ingenuity and meticulous in the collection and recording of accurate data 
on the positions of the planets. He was utterly devoid of the gift of theo­
retical speculation and mathematical power. 
Kepler, the poor and sickly mathematician, unfitted by nature for 
accurate observations, was gifted with the patience and innate 
1 

<<<PAGE 17>>>

2 TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANICS Ch.1 
mathematical perception needed to unlock the secrets hidden in 
Tycho's data.2 
1.1.1 Kepler's Laws. Since the time of Aristotle, who taught that 
circular motion was the only perfect and natural motion and that the 
heavenly bodies, therefore, necessarily moved in circles, the planets 
were assumed to revolve in circular paths or combinations of smaller 
circles moving on larger ones. But now that Kepler had the accurate 
observations of Tycho to refer to he found immense difficulty in recon­
ciling any such theory with the observed facts. From 1601 until 1606 
he tried fitting various geometrical curves to Tycho's data on the posi­
tions of Mars. Finally, after struggling for almost a year to remove a 
discrepancy of only 8 minutes of arc (which a less honest man might 
have chosen to ignore!), Kepler hit upon the ellipse as a possible solu­
tion. It fit. The orbit was found and in 1609 Kepler published his first 
two laws of planetary motion. The third law followed in 1619.3 
These laws which mark an epoch in the history of mathematical 
science are as follows: 
KEPLER'S LAWS 
First Law-The orbit of each planet is an ellipse, with the 
sun at a focus. 
Second Law-The line joining the planet to the sun sweeps 
out equal areas in equal times. 
Third Law -The square of the period of a planet is propor­
tional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun. 
Still, Kepler's laws were only a description, not an explanation of 
planetary motion. It remained for the genius of Isaac Newton to 
unravel the mystery of "why?". 
In 1665 Newton was a student at the University of Cambridge when 
an outbreak of the plague forced the university to close down for 2 
years. Those 2 years were to be the most ·creative period in Newton's 
life. The 23-year-old genius conceived the law of gravitation, the laws of 
motion and developed the fundamental concepts of the differential 
calculus during the long vacation of 1666, but owing to some small 
discrepancies in his explanation of the moon's motion he tossed his 
papers aside. The world was not to learn of his momentous discoveries 
until some 20 years later! 
To Edmund Halley, discoverer of Halley's comet, is due the credit 
for bringing Newton's discoveries before the world. One day in 1685 

<<<PAGE 18>>>

Sec. 1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND BASIC LAWS 3 
Halley and two of his contemporaries, Christopher Wren and Robert 
Hooke, were discussing the theory of Descartes which explained the 
motion of the planets by means of whirlpools and eddies which swept 
the planets around the sun. Dissatisfied with this explanation, they 
speculated whether a force. "similar to magnetism " and falling off 
inversely with the square of distance might not require the planets to 
move in precisely elliptical paths. Hooke thought that this should be 
easy to prove whereupon Wren offered Hooke 40 shillings if he could 
produce the proof within 2 weeks. The 2 weeks passed and nothing 
more was heard from Hooke. Several months later Halley was visiting 
Newton at Cambridge and, without mentioning the bet, casually posed 
the question, "If the sun pulled the planets with a force inversely 
proportional to the square of their distances, in what paths ought they 
to go?" To Halley's utter and complete astonishment Newton replied 
without hesitation, "Why, in ellipses, of course. I have already calcu­
lated it and have the proof among my papers somewhere. Give me a few 
days and I shall find it for you." Newton was referring to the work he 
had done some 20 years earlier and only in this casual way was his 
greatest discovery made known to the world! 
Halley, when he recovered from his shock , advised his reticent friend 
to develop completel y and to publish his explanation of planetary 
motion. The result took 2 years in preparation and appeared in 1687 as 
The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, or, more simply, 
the Principia, undoubte dly one of the supreme achieveme nts of the 
human mind.4 
1.1.2 Newton's Laws of Motion. In Book I of the Principia Newton 
introduces his three laws of motion: 
NEWTON'S LAWS 
First Law-Every body continues in its state of rest or of 
uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to 
change that state by forces impressed upon it. 
Second Law-The rate of change of momentum is propor­
tional to the force impressed and is in the same direction as 
that force. 
Third Law-To every action there is always opposed an 
equal reaction. 
The second law can be expressed mathematical ly as follows:

where LF is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the mass m and r­
is the vector acceleration of the mass measured relative to an inertial 
reference frame shown as )0(Z in Figure 1.1-1. Note that equation 
(1.1-1) applies only for a fixed mass system. 
1.1.3 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. Besides enunciating 
his three laws of motion in the Principia, Newton fonnulated the law of 
gravity by stating that any two bodies attract one another with a force 
proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional 
to the square of the distance between them. We can express this law 
mathematically in vector notation as: 
Fg=-GMm r 
r 2 r (1.1-2) 
where F 9 is the force on mass m due to mass M and r is the vector from 
M to m. The universal gravitational constant, G, has the value 
6.67Ox10-8 dyne cm2 Igm2 • 
In the next sections we will apply equation (1.1-2) to equati;n 
(1.1-1) and develop the equation of motion for planets and satellites.

We will begin with the general N-body problem and then specialize to 
the problem of two bodies. 
1.2 THE N-BODY PROBLEM 
In this section we shall examine in some detail the motion of a body 
(i.e., an earth satellite, a lunar or interplanetary probe, or a planet). At 
any given time in its journey, the body is being acted upon by several 
gravitatio nal masses and may even be experiencing other forces such as 
drag, thrust and solar radiation pressure. 
For this examination we shall assume a "system" of nobodies (m}. m2• m3 ... f'T"h) one of which is the body whose motion we 
wish to study-call it the jth body, m j. The vector sum of all gravita­
tional forces and other external forces acting on m. will be used to 
I 
determine the equation of motion. To determine the gravitational 
forces we shall apply Newton's law of universal gravitation. In addition, 
the jth body may be a rocket expelling mass (i.e., propellan ts) to pro­
duce thrust; the motion may be in an atmosphere where drag effects are 
present; solar radiation may impart some pressure on the body; etc. All 
of these effects must be considered in the general equation of motion. 
An important force, not yet mentioned is due to the nonspherical shape 
of the planets. The earth is flattened at the poles and bulged at the 

<<<PAGE 21>>>

6 lWO-B ODY ORBIT AL ME CHANICS Ch. 1 
equator; the moon is elliptical about the poles and about the equator. 
Newton's law of universal gravitation applies only if the bodies are 
spherical and if the mass is evenly distributed in spherical shells. Thus, 
variations are introduced to the gravitational forces due primarily to the 
shape of the bodies. The magnitude of this force for a near-earth 
satellite is on the order of 10-3 g's. Although small, this force is re­
sponsible for several important effects not predictable from the studies 
of Kepler and Newton. These effects, regression of the line-of-nodes 
and rotation of the line of apsides, are discussed in Chapter 3. 
The first step in our analysis will be to choose a "suitable" coordi­
nate system in which to express the motion. This is not a simple task 
since any coordinate system we choose has a fair degree of uncertainty 
as to its inertial qualities. Without losing generality let us assume a 
"suitable" coordinate system ( X, Y, Z) in which the positions of the n 
masses are known r1 r2, ••• rn' This system is illustrated in Figure 
1.2-1.

Applying Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force F gn 
exerted on mj by mn is 
where Gm. m F gn = - I n ( r nj ) (1.2.1) r nj 3

body may be written

The other external force, FaTHER' illustrated in Figure 1.2·1 is 
composed of drag, thrust, solar radiation pressure, perturbations due to 
nonspherica1 shapes, etc. The combined force acting on the jth body we 
will call F TOT A L' where

F TOTAL = F 9 + F OTHER' (l.2-6) 
We are now ready to apply Newton's second law of motion. Thus, 
d� (mjvj) = FTOTAL. (1.2-7) 
The time derivative may be expanded to 
m· dVj dmj_F I--+V'---dt I dt TOTAL (1.2-8) 
It was previously mentioned that the body may be expelling some mass 
to produce thrust in which case the second term of equation 1.2-8 
would not be zero. Certain relativistic effects would also give rise to 
changes in the mass m j as a function of time. In other words, it is not 
always true-especially in space dynamics-that F = ma. Dividing 
throur by the mass m j gives the most general equation of motion for

Ii is the velocity vector of the ith body relative to the X, Y,

Equation (1.2-9) is a second order, nonlinear, vector, differential 
equation of motion which has defied solution in its present form. It is 
here therefore that we depart from the realities of nature to make some 
simplifying assumptions. 
Assume that the mass of the ith body remains constant (Le.,

is the acceleration of the satellite relative to earth. The effect of the last 
term of equation (1.2-17) is to account for the perturbing effects of the 
moon, sun and plane ts on a near earth satellite. 
To further simplify this equation it is necessary to determine the 
magnitude of. the perturbing effects compared to the force between 
earth and satellite. Table 1.2�1 lists the relative accelerations (not the

Now that we have a general expression for the relative motion of 
two bodies perturbed by other bodies it would be a simplf' matter to 
reduce it to an equation for only two bodies. However, to further 
clarify the derivation of the equation of relative motion, some of the 
work of the previous section will be repeated considering just two 
bodies. 
1.3.1 Simplifying Assumptions. There are two assumptions we will 
make with regard to our model: 
1. The bodies are spherically symmetric. This enables us to treat the 
bodies as though their masses were concentrated at their centers. 

<<<PAGE 27>>>

12 TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANICS Ch. 1 
2. There are no external nor internal forces acting on the system 
other than the gravitational forces which act along the line joining the 
centers of the two bodies. 
1.3.2 The Equation of Relative Motion. Before we may apply 
Newton's second law to determine the equation of relative motion of 
these two bodies, we must find an inertial (unaccelerated and 
nonrotating) reference frame for the purpose of measuring the motion 
or the lack of it. Newton described this inertial reference frame by 
saying that it was fixed in absolute space, which "in its own nature, 
without relation to anything external, remains always similar and 
irrnnovable."s However, he failed to indicate how one found this frame 
which was absolutely at rest. For the time being, let us carryon with 
our investigation of the relative motion by assuming that we have found 
such an inertial reference frame and then later return to a discussion of 
the consequences of the fact that in reality all we can ever find is an 
"almost" inertial reference frame. 
Consider the system of two bodies of mass M and m illustrated in 
Figure 1.3-1. Let (X', Y', Z') be an inertial set ofrectangular cartesian 
coordinates. Let (X, Y, Z) be a set of nonrotating coordinates parallel 
to (X', Y', Z') and having an origin coincident with the body of mass M. 
The position vectors of the bodies M and m with respect to the set (X', 
Y', Z') are rM and rm respectively. Note that we have defined 
r = rm -rM• 
Now we can apply Newton's laws in the inertial frame (X', Y', Z') and 
obtain 
mf = -GMm 1.. 
m r2 r 
and Mf = GMm L M r 2 r 
The above equations may be written: 
f =_-.GM r m r3 
and tM=�r . r (1.3-1)

Equation (1.3-3) is the vector differential equation of the relative 
motion for the two-body problem. Note that this is the same as 
equation (1.2-17) without perturbing effects and with r 12 replaced by r. 
Note that since the coordinate set (X, Y, Z) is nonrotating with 
respect to the coordinate set eX', Y', Z'), the magnitudes and directions 
of r and f as measured in the set (X, Y, Z) will be equal respectively to 
their magnitudes and directions as measured in the inertial set (X', Y', 
Z'). Thus having postulated the existence of an inertial reference frame 
in order to derive equation (1.3-3), we may now discard it and measure 
the relative position, velocity, and acceleration in a nonrotating, 
noninertial coordinate system such as the set (X, Y, Z) with its origin in 
the central body. 
Since our efforts in this text will be devoted to studying the motion 
of artificial satellites, ballistic missiles, or space probes orbiting about

some planet or the sun, the mass of the orbiting body, m, will be much 
less than that of the central body, M. Hence we see that 
G(M+m) ::::::GM. 
It is convenient to define a parameter, Il (mu), called the gravitational 
parameter as 
Il == GM. 
Then equation 1.3·3 becomes 
I t"+ *r = 0·1 (1.3·4) 
Equation (1.34) is the two·body equation of motion that we will use 
for the remainder of the text. Rememb er that the results obtai ned from 
equation (1.34) will be only as accurate as the assumptions (1) and (2) 
and the assumption that M � m. If m is not much less than M, then 
G (M + m) must be used in place of Il (so defined by some authors). Il 
will have a different value for each major attracting body. Values for 
the earth and sun are listed in the appendix and values for other planets 
are included in Chapter 8. 
1.4 CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION 
Before attempting to solve the equation of motion to obtain the 
trajectory of a satellite we shall derive some useful information about 
the nature of orbital motion. If you think about the model we have 
created, namely a small mass moving in a gravitational field whose force 
is always directed toward the center of a larger mass, you would 
probably arrive intuitively at the conclusions we will shortly confirm by 
rigorous mathematical proofs. From your previous knowledge of 
physics and mechanics you know that a gravitational field is 
"conservative." That is, an object moving under the influence of gravity 
alone does not lose or gain mechanical energy but only exchange s one 
form of energy, "kinetic," for another form called "potential energy." 
You also know that it takes a tangential component of force to change 
the angular momentum of a system in rotational motion about some 
center of rotation. Since the gravitational force is always directed 
radially toward the center of the large mass we would expect that the 
angular momentum of the satellite about the center of our reference 

<<<PAGE 30>>>

Sec. 1.4 CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION 15 
frame (the large mass) does not change. In the next two sections we will 
prove these statements. 
1.4.1 Conservation of Mechanical Energy. The energy constant of 
motion can be derived 'as follows: 
1. Dot multiply eq�tion (1.3-4) by r 
o .. + 0 "I O' ror ro�r= . r

4. To make step 3 perfectly general we should say that 
-.!!./v2 +c-L\=o 
dt \ 2 r J 
where c can be any arbitrary constant since the t ime derivative of any 
constant is zero. 
5. If the time rate of change of an expression is zero, that 
expression must be a constant which we will call &. Therefore, 
= a constant called (1.4-1) 
"specific mechanical energy" 
The first term of & is obviously the kinetic energy per unit mass of the 
satellite. To convince yourself that the second term is the potential 
energy per unit mass you need only equate it with the work done in 
moving a satellite from one point in space to another against the force 
of gravity. But what about the arbitrary constant, C, which appears in 

<<<PAGE 31>>>

16 TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANI CS Ch.1 
the potential energy term? The value of this constant will depend on 
the zero reference of potential energy. In other words, at what distance, 
r, do you want to say the potential energy is zero? This is obviously 
arbitrary. In your elementary physics courses it was convenient to' 
choose ground level or the surface of the earth as the zero datum for 
potential energy, in which case an object lying at the bottom of a deep 
well was found to have a negative potential energy. If we wish to retain 
the surface of the large mass, e.g. the earth, as our zero reference we 
would choose c = �, where rEB is the radius of the earth. This would be 
perfectly legitimate but since c is arbitrary, why not set it equal to 
zero? Setting c equal to zero is equivalent to choosing our zero 
reference for potential energy at infinity. The price we pay for this 
simplification is that the potential energy of a satellite (now simply -¥> 
will always be negative. 
We conclude, therefore, that the specific mechanical energy, �,of a 
satellite which is the sum of its kinetic energy per unit mass and its 
potential energy per unit mass remains constant along its orbit, neither 
increasing nor decreasing as a result of its motion. The expression for � 
is 
(1.4-2) 
1.4.2 Conservation of angular momentum . The angular momentum 
constant of the motion is obtained as follows: 
1. Cross multiply equation (1.34) by r 
r x f + r x � r = O. r 
2. Since in general a x a= 0, the second term vanishes and 
r X f = O. 
3. Noticing that.fL (rxf) = f Xf + rxr the equation above becomes 
dt ' 
-.iL (r X r) = 0 
dt or -.iL (rxv) = O. 
dt 

<<<PAGE 32>>>

Sec. 1.4 CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION 17 
The expression r x v which must be a constant of the motion is simply 
the vector h, called specific angular momentum. Therefore, we have 
shown that the specific angular momentum, h, of a satellite remains 
constant along its orbit and that the expression for his 
I h=r xv. I (1.4-3) 
Since h is the vector cross product of r and v it must always be 
perpendicular to the plane containing rand v. But h is a constant vector 
so r and v must always"remain in the same plane. Therefore, we 
conclude that the satellite's motion must be confined to a plane which 
is fixed in space. We shall refer to this as the orbital plane. 
By looking at the vectors r and v in the orbital plane and the angle 
between them (see Figure 1.4-1) we can derive another useful 
expression for the magnitude of the vector h. 
v 
Figure 1.4-1 Flight-path angle, </J 
No matter where a satellite is located in space it is always possible to 
define "up and down" and "horizontal." "Up" simply means away 

<<<PAGE 33>>>

18 TWO·BODY ORBITAL MECHAN ICS, Ch.1 
from the center of the earth and "down" means toward the center of 
the earth. So the local vertical at the location of the satellite coincides 
with the direction of the vector r. The local horizontal plane must then 
be perpendicular to the local vertical. We can now define the direction 
of the velocity vector, v, by specifying the angle it makes with the local 
vertical as 'Y (gamma), the zenith angle. The angle between the velocity 
vector and the local horizonta l plane is called ¢ (phi), the flight·path 
elevation angle or simply "flight·path angle." From the definition of 
the cross product the magnitude of h is 
h = N sin 'Y, 
We will find it more convenient, however, to express h in terms of the 
flight·path angle, ¢. Since 'Yand ¢ are obviously complemen tary angles 
I h = rv cos ¢. (1.4.4) 
The sign of ¢ will be the same as the sign of r • v. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. In an inertial coordinate system, the 
position and velocity vectors of a satellite are, respectively, (4.1852 1+ 
6.2778 J + 10.463 K) 107 ft and (2.5936 1+ 5.1872 1) 104 ft/sec 
where I, J and K are unit vectors. Determine the specific mechanical 
energy, &, and the specific angular momentum, h. Also find the 
flight·path angle, ¢.

1.5 THE TRAJECTORY EQUATION 
Earlier we wrote the equation of motion for a small mass orbiting a 
large central body. While this equation (1.3-3) is simple, its complete 
solution is not. A partial solution which will tell us the size and shape 
of the orbit is easy to obtain.· The more difficult question of how the 
satellite moves around this orbit as a function of time will be postponed 
to Chapter 4. 
1.5.1 Integration of the Equation of Motion. You recall that the 
equation of motion for the two-body problem is 
r=--1!y r. r 
Crossing this equation into h leads toward a form which can be 
integrated: 
f X h = JJ. 3 (h X r). r (1.5-1)

r = h2/g .

1.5.2 ThePolarEquation of a Conic Section. Equation (1.5-3) is the 
trajectory equation expressed in polar coordinates where the polar 
angle, V, is measured from the ftxed vector B to r. To determine what 
kind of a curve it represents we need only compare it to the general 
equation of a conic section written in polar coordinates with the origin 
located at a focus and where the polar angle, v, is the angle between r 
and the point on the conic nearest the focus: 
I r- p 1 + e cos V (1.5-4) 
In this equation, which is mathema tically identical in form to the 
trajectory equation, p is a geometrical constant of the conic called the 
"parameter" or "semi-latus rectum." The constant e is called the 
"eccentricity" and it determines the type of conic section represented 
by equation (1.5-4) .

The similarity in form between the trajectory equation (1.5-3) and 
the equation of a conic section (1.5-4) not only verifies Kepler's first 
law but allows us to extend the law to include orbital motion along any 
conic section path, not just ellipses. 
We can summarize our knowledge concerning orbital motion up to 
this point as follows: 
1. The family of curves called "conic sections" (circle, ellipse, 
parabola, hyperbola) represent the only possible paths for an orbiting 
object in the two-body problem. 
2. The focus of the conic orbit must be located at the center of the 
central body. 
3. The mechanical energy of a satellite (which is the sum of kinetic 
and potential energy) does not change as the satellite moves along its 
conic orbit. There is, however, an exchange of energy between the two 
forms, potential and kinetic, which means that the satellite must 
slow-down as it gains altitude (as r increases) and speed-up as r 
decreases in such a manner that 8, remains co nstant. 
4. The orbital rriotion takes place in a plane which is fixed in inertial 
space. 
5. The specific angular momentum of a satellite about the central 
attracting body remains constant. As r and v change along the orbit, the 
flight-path angle, cp, must change so as to keep h constant. (See Figure 
1.4-1 and equation (1.4-4) 
1.5.3 Geometrical Properties Common to All Conic Sections. 
Although Figure 1.5-1 illustrates an ellipse, the ellipse is only one of the 
family of curves called conic sections. Before discussing the factors 

<<<PAGE 37>>>

22 TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANICS Ch. 1 
Figure 1.5-2 The conic sections 
which determine which of these conic curves a satellite will follow, we 
need to know a few facts about conic sections in general. 
The conic sections have been known and studied for centuries. Many 
of their most interesting properties were discovered by the early 
Greeks. The name derives from the fact that a conic section may be 
defined as the curve of intersection of a plane and a right circular cone. 
Figure 1.5-2 illustrates this definition. If the plane cuts across one 
nappe (half-cone), the section is an ellipse. A circle is just a special case 
of the ellipse where the plane is parallel to the base of the cone. If, in 
addition to cutting just one nappe of the cone, the plane is parallel to a 
line in the surface of the cone, the section is a parabola. If the plane 
cuts both nappes, the section is a hyperbola having two branches. There 
are also degenerate conics consisting of one or two straight lines, or a 
single point, these are produced by planes passing throuih the apex of 
the cone. 
There is an alternate definition of a conic which is mathematically 
equivalent to the geometrical definition above: 
A conic is a circle or the locus of a point which moves so that 
the ratio of its absolute distance from a given point (a focus) to 

<<<PAGE 38>>>

Sec 1.5 THE TRAJECTORY EQUATION 
its absolute distance from a given line (a directrix) is a positive 
constant e (the eccentricity). 23 
While the directrix has no physical significance as far as orbits are 
concerned, the focus and eccentricity are indispensable concepts in the 
understanding of orbital motion. Figure 1.5-3 below illustrates certain 
other geometrical dimensions and relationships which are common to 
all conic sections. 
Because of their symmetry all conic sections have two foci, F and F'. 
The prime focus, F, marks the location of the central attracting body in 
an orbit. The secondary or vacant focus, F', has little significance in

orbital mechanics. In the parabola, which represents the borderline case 
between the open and closed orbits, the secondary focus is assumed to 
lie an infinite distance to the left of F. The width of each curve at the 
focus is a positive dimension called the latus rectum and is labeled 2 p 
in Figure 1.5-3. The length of the chord passing through the foci is 
called the major axis of the conic and i� labeled 2 a. The dimension, a, 
is c�lled the semi-major axis. Note that for the circle 2 a is simply the 
diameter, for the parabola 2 a is infmite and for the hyperbola 2 a is 
taken as negative. The distance between the foci is given the symbol 2 
c. For the circle the foci are considered coincident and 2 cis zero, for 
the parabola 2 c is infinite and for the hyperbola 2 C is taken as a 
negative. It follows directly from the definition of a conic section given 
above that for any conic except a parabola 
and c e=­a 
p = a (1 -e2). (1.5-5) 
(1.5-6) 
The extreme end -points of the major axis of an orbit are referred to 
as "apses". The point nearest the prime focus is called "periapsis" 
(meaning the "near apse") and the point farthest from the prime focus 
is called "apoapsis" (meaning the "far apse"). Depending on what is the 
central attracting body in an orbital situation these points may also be 
called "perigee" or "apogee," "perihelion" or "aphelion," "perise­
lenium" or "aposelenium," etc. Notice that for the circle these points 
are not uniquely defined and for the op�n curves (parabolas and 
hyperbolas) the apoapsis has no physical meaning. 
The distance from the prime focus to either periapsis or apoapsis 
(where it exists) can be expressed by simply inserting V = 00 or V = 
lf3CP in the general polar equation of a conic section (equation (2.5-4)). 
Thus, for any conic 
-p r min = r periapsis -1 + e cos 00

1.5.4 The Eccentricity Vector. In the derivation of equation (1.5-3), 
the trajectory equation, we encountered the vector constant of 
integration, B, which points toward periapsis. By comparing equations 
(1.5-3) and (1.5-4) we conclude that B=tLe. Quite obviously, since eis 
also a constant vector pointing toward periapsis., 
e = BltL. (1.5-9)

1.6 RELATING &. AND h TO THE GEOMETRY OF AN ORBIT 
By comparing equation (1.5-3) and equation (1.5-4) we see 
immediately that the parameter or semi-latus rectum, p, of the orbit 
depends only on the specific angular momentum, h, of the satellite. By 
inspectio n,/or any orbit, 
p=h2/p.. (1.6-1 ) 
In order to see intuitively why an increase in h should result in a 
larger value for p consider the following argument: 
Suppose that a cannon were set up on the top of a high mountain 
whose summit extends above the sensible atmosphere (so that we may 
neglect atmospheric drag). If the muzzle of the cannon is aimed 
horizontally and the cannon is fired, equation (1.4-4) tells us that h=rv 
since the flight-path angle, 1;, is zero. Therefore, progressively increasing 
the muzzle velocity, v, is equivalent to increasing h. Figure 1.6-1 shows 
the family of curves which represent the trajectory or orbit of the 
cannonball as the angular momentum of the "cannonball satellite" is 
progressively increased. Notice that each trajectory is a conic section 
with the focus located at the center of the earth, and that as h is

As a by-product of this example we note that at periapsis or apoapsis 
of any conic orbit the velocity vector (which is always tangent to the

can then write, as a corollary to equation (1.4-4),

(l.6-3) 
This simple relationship which is valid for all conic orbits tells us 
that the semi-major axis, a, of an orbit depends only on the specific 
mechanical energy, &, of the satellite (which in turn depends only on r 
and V at any point along the orbit). Figure 1.6-1 serves as well to 
illustrate the intuitive explanation of this fundamental relationship 
since progressively increasing the muzzle velocity of the cannon also 
progressively increases &. 
Many students find equation (1.6-3) misleading. You should study it 
together with Figure 1.5-3 which shows that for the circle and ellipse a 
is positive, while for the parabola a is infinite and for the hyperbola a is 
negative. This implies that the specific mechanical energy of a satellite 
in a closed orbit (circle or ellipse) is negative, while & for a satellite in a 
parabolic orbit is zero and on a hyperbolic orbit the energy is positive. 
Thus, the energy of a satellite (negative , zero, or positive) alone 
determines the type of conic orbit the satellite is in. 
Since h alone determines p and since & alone determines a, the two 
together determine e (which specifies the exact shape of conic orbit). 
This can be shown as follows: 
p = a (1 - e2) therefore e = J 1 -f

Notice again that if & is negative, e is positive and less than 1 (an 
ellipse); if & is zero, e is exactly 1 (a parabola); if & is positive, e is 
greater than I (a hyperbola). But what if h is zero regardless of what 
value & has? The eccentricity will be exactly 1 but the orbit will not be 
a parabola! Rather, the orbit will be a degenerate conic (a point or 
straight line). The student should be aware of this pitfall. Namely, all 
parabolas have an eccentricity of 1 but an orbit whose eccentricity is 1 
need not be a parabola-it could be a degenerate conic.

1.7 THE ELLIPTICAL ORBIT 
The orbits of all the planets in the solar system as well as the orbits 
of all earth satellites are ellipses. Since an ellipse is a closed curve, an 
object in an elliptical orbit travels the same path over and over. The 
time for the satellite to go once around its orbit is called the period. We 
will first look at some geometrical results which apply only to the 
ellipse and then derive an expression for the period of an elliptical 
orbit. 
1.7.1 Geometry of the Ellipse. An ellipse can be constructed using 
two pins and a loop ofthread. The method is illustrated in Figure 1.7·1. 
Each pin marks the location of a focus and since the length of the 
thread is constant, the sum of the distances from any point on an 
ellipse to each focus (r + r') is a constant. When the pencil is at either 
end·point of the ellipse it is easy to see that, specifically 
r + r' = 2a. (1.7·1) 
By inspection, the radius of periapsis and the radius of apoapsis are 
related to the major axis of an ellipse as 
I r p + r a = 2a. I (1.7·2) 
Also by inspection, the distance between the foci is 
(1.7·3)

Since, in general, e is defined as da, equation (1.7-2) and(1.7-3) 
combine to yield 
(1.7-4) 
The width of an ellipse at the center is called the minor axis, 2 b. At 
the end of the minor axis r and r' are equal as illustrated at the right of 
Figure 1.7-1. Since r + r' = 2a, rand r' must both be equal to a at this 
point. Dropping a perpendicular to the major axis (dotted line in Figure 
1.7-1) we can form a right triangle from which we conclude that

1.7.2 Period of an Elliptical Orbit. If you refer to Figure 1.7-2, you 
will see that the-horizonta l component of velocity of a satellite is 
simply V cos cjJ which can also be expressed as r v. Using equation 
(1.4-4) we can express the specific angular momentum of the satellite as 
which, when rearranged, becomes 
r2 dt = 11 dll. (1.7-6)

But from elementary calculus we know that the differential element of 
area, d A, swept out by the radius vector as it moves through an angle, 
d v, is given by the expression 
Figure 1.7-3 Differential element of area 
So, we can rewrite equation (1.7-6) as 
2 dt = 11 dA. (1.7-7) 

<<<PAGE 48>>>

Sec. 1.8 THE CIRCULAR ORBIT 33 
Equation (1.7-7) proves Kepler's second law that "equal areas are 
swept out by the radius vector in equal time intervals" since h is a 
constant for an orbit. 
During one orbital period the radius vector sweeps out the entire 
area of the ellipse. Integrating equation (1.7-7) for one period gives us 
lP = 21Tab h (1.7-8) 
where 1T a b is the total area of an ellipse and lP is the period. From 
equations (1.7-5), (1.5-5) and (1.5-6) 
b=)a2 -c2 =)a2(1 -e2) =JaP 
and, since h =/JlP, 
IlP= � a'/2 (1.7-9) 
Thus, the period of an elliptical orbit depends only on the size of the 
semi-major axis, a. Equation (1.7-9), incidenta lly, proves Kepler's third 
law that "the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the 
mean distance" since a, being the average of the periapsis and apoapsis 
radii, is the "mean distance" of a satellite from the prime focus. 
1.8 THE CIRCULAR ORBIT 
The circle is just a special case of an ellipse so all the relationships we 
just derived for the elliptical orbit including the period are also valid for 
the circular orbit. Of course, the semi-major axis of a circular orbit is 
just its radius, so equation (1.7-9) is simply 
lP = 21T 3/2

1.8.1 Circular Satellite Speed. The speed necessary to place a 
satellite in a circular orbit is called circular speed. Naturally , the 
satellite must be launched in the horizontal direction at the desired 

<<<PAGE 49>>>

34 TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANICS Ch. 1 
altitude to achieve a circular orbit. The latter condition is called circular 
velocity and implies both the correct speed and direction. We can 
calculate the speed required for a circular orbit of radius, r CS' from the 
energy equation.

2 r 2a 
If we remember that r CS = a, we obtain 
2 Ves _L= __ Il_ 
2 
which reduces to 
(1.8-2) 
Notice that the greater the radius of the circular orbit the less speed 
is required to keep the satellite in this orbit. For a low altitude earth 
orbit, circular speed is about 26,000 ft/sec while the speed required to 
keep the moon in its orbit around the earth is only about 3,000 ft/sec. 
1.9 THE PARABOLIC ORBIT 
The parabolic orbit is rarely found in nature although the orbits of 
some comets approximate a parabola. The parabola is interesting 
because it represents the borderline case between the open and closed 
orbits. An object traveling a parabolic path is on a one-way trip to 
infmity and will never retrace the same path again. 
1.9.1 Geometry of the Parabola. There are only a few geometrical 
properties peculiar to the parabola which you should know. One is that 
the two arms of a parabola become more and more nearly parallel as 
one extends them further and further to the left of the focus in Figure 
1.9-1. Another is that, since the eccentricity of a parabola is exactly 1, 
the periapsis radius is just 
r =�

which follows from equation (l.5-7). Of course, there is no apoapsis for 
a parabola and it may be thought of as an "infinitely long ellipse." 
1.9.2 Escape Speed. Even though the gravitational field of the sun 
or a planet theoretically extends to infinity, its strength decreases so 
rapidly with distance that only a finite amount of kinetic energy is 
needed to overcome the effects of gravity and allow an object to coast 
to an infinite distance without "falling back." The speed which is just 
sufficient to do this is called escape speed. A space probe which is given 
escape speed in any direction will travel on a parabolic escape 
trajectory. Theoretically, as its distance from the central body 
approaches infinity its speed approaches zero. We can calculate the 
speed necessary to escape by writing the energy equation for two points 
along the escape trajectory; first at a general point a distance, r, from 
the center where the "local escape speed" is vesco and then at infinity 
where the speed will be zero:

from which

<<<PAGE 51>>>

36 TWO-BODY ORBITAL MECHANICS ell. 1 
Since the specific mechanical energy, 8., must be zero if the probe is 
to have zero speed at infinity and since 8. = -j.1/2a, the semi-major axis, 
a, of the escape trajectory must be infinite which confirms that it is a 
parabola. 
As you would expect, the farther away you are from the central 
body (larger value of r) the less speed it takes to escape the remainder 
of the gravitational field. Escape speed from the surface of the earth is 
about 36,700 ft/sec while from a point 3,400 nm above the surface it is 
only 26,000 ft/sec. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. A space probe is to be launched on an 
escape trajectory from a circular parking orbit which is at an altitude of 
100 n mi above the earth. Calculate the minimum escape speed re­
quired to escape from the parking orbit altitude. (Ignore the gravita­
tional forces of the sun and other planets.) Sketch the escape trajectory 
and the circular parking orbit.

1.10 THE HYPERBO LIC ORBIT 
Meteors which strike the earth and interplanetary probes sent from 
the earth travel hyperbolic paths relative to the earth. A hyperbolic 
orbit is necessary if we want the probe to have some speed left over 
after it escapes the earth's gravitational field. The hyperbola is an 
unusual and interesting conic section because it has two branches. Its 
geometry is worth a few moments of study. 
1.10.1 Geometry of the Hyperbola. The arms of a hyperbola are 
asymptotic to two intersecting straight lines (the asymptotes). If we 
consider the left-hand focus, F, as the prime focus (where the center of 
Figure 1.10-1 Geometry of the hyperbola 
our gravitating body is located), then only the left branch of the 
hyperbola represents the possible orbit. If, instead, we assume a force 
of repulsion between our satellite and the body located at F (such as 
the force between two like-charged electrical particles), then the 
right-hand branch represents the orbit. The parameters a, band Care 
labeled in Figure Ll 0-1. Obviously,

for the hyperbola. The angle between the asymptotes, which represents 
the angle through which the path of a space probe is turned by its 
encounter with a planet, is la beled ° (delta) in Figure 1.10-1. The 
turning angle, 0, is related to the geometry of the hyperbola as follows: 
° a sin ---2 c 
but since e = cia equation (1.1 0-2) becomes (1.10-2) 
(1.10-3) 
The greater the eccentricity of the hyperbola, the smaller will be the 
turning angle ,0. 
1.10.2 Hyperbolic Excess Speed. If you give a space probe exactly 
escape speed, it will just barely escape the gravitational field which 
Figure 1.10-2 Hyperbolic excess speed 
means that its speed will be approaching zero as its distance from the 
force center approaches infmity. If, on the other hand, we give our 
probe more than escape speed at a point near the earth, we would 
expect the speed at a great distance from the earth to be approaching 
some finite constant value. This residual speed which the probe would 
have left over even at infmity is called "hyperbolic excess speed." We 
can calculate this speed from the energy equation written for two 
points on the hyperbolic escape trajectory-a point near the earth called 
the "burnout point" and a point an infinite distance from the earth 
where the speed will be the hyperbolic excess speed, V 00' 

<<<PAGE 55>>>

40 TWO-BODY ORBIT AL MECHANICS Ch. 1 
Since specific mechanical energy does not change along an orbit, we 
may equate & at the burnout point and & at infinity: 
(1.10-4) 
from which we conclude that 
(1.10-5) 
Note that if Voa is zero (as it is on a parabolic trajectory) vbo' 
becomes simply the escape speed. 
1.10.3 Sphere of Influence. It is, of course, absurd to talk about a 
space probe "reaching infinity" and in this sense it is meaningless to 
talk about escaping a gravitational field completely. It is a fact, 
however, that once a space probe is a great distance (say, a million 
miles) from earth, for all practical purposes it has escaped. In other 
words, it has already slowed down to very nearly its hyperbolic excess 
speed. It is convenient to define a sphere around every gravitational 
body and say that when a probe crosses the edge of this "sphere of 
influence " it has escaped. Although it is difficult to get even two people 
to agree on exactly where the sphere of influence should be drawn, the 
concept is convenient and is widely used, especially in lunar and 
interplanetary trajectories. 
1.11 CANONICAL UNITS 
Astronomers are as yet unable to determine the precise distance and 
mass of objects in space. Such fundamental quantitie s as the mean 
distance from the earth to the sun, the mass and mean distance of the 
moon and the mass of the sun are not accurately known. This dilemma 
is avoided in mathematical calculations if we assume the mass of the 
sun to be 1 "mass unit" and the mean distance from the earth to the 
sun to be our unit of distance which is called an "astronomical unit." 
All other masses and distances can then be given in terms of these 
assumed units even though we do not know precisely the absolute value 
of the sun's mass and distance in pounds or miles. Astronomers call thi� 

<<<PAGE 56>>>

Sec. 1.11 CANON ICAL UNITS 41 
normalized system of units "canonical units." 
We will adopt a similar system of normalized units in this text 
primarily for the purpose of simplifying the arithmetic of our orbit 
calculations. 
1.11.1 The Reference Orbit. We will use a system of units based on 
a hypothetical circular reference orbit. In a two-body problem where 
the sun is the central body the reference orbit will be a circular orbit 
whose radius is one astronomical unit (AU). For other problems where 
the earth, moon, or some other planet is the central body the reference 
orbit will be a minimum altitude circular orbit just grazing the surface 
of the planet. 
We will define our distance unit (DU) to be the radius of the 
reference orbit. If we now define our time unit (TU) such that the 
speed of a satellite in the hypothetical reference orbit is 1 DU/TU, then 
the value of the gravitational parameter, J.l, will turn out to be 1 
DU3/TU2. 
Unless it is perfectly clear which reference orbit the units in your 
problem are based on you will have to indicate this by means of a 
subscript on the symbol DU and TU. This is most easily done by 
annexing as a subscript the astronome r's symbol for the sun, earth, or 
other planet. The most commonly used symbols are: 
0 The Sun '2\. Jupiter 
« The Moon 11 Saturn 
� Mercury a Uranus 
� Venus tV Neptune 
E9 The Earth E Pluto 
if Mars 
The concept of the reference orbit is illustrated in Figure 1.11-1. 
Values for the commonly used astrodynamic constants and their 
relationship to canonical units are listed in the appendice s. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. A space object is sighted at an altitude of 
1.046284 x 107ft above the earth traveling at 2.593625-x 104 ft/sec 
and a flight path angle of 00 at the time of sighting. Using canonical

ORBIT DETERMINATION FROM OBSERVATIONS 
Finally, as all our observations, on account of the 
imperfection of the instruments and of the senses, are only 
approximations to the truth, an orbit based only on the six 
absolutely necessary data may be still liable to considerable 
errors. In order to diminish these as much as possible, and 
thus to reach the greatest precision attainable, no other 
method will be given except to, accumulate the greatest 
number of the most perfect observations, and to adjust the 
elements, not so as to satisfy this or that set of observations 
with absolute exactness, but so as to ag ree with all in the 
best possible manner. 
-Carl Friedrich Gaussl 
2.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
The first method of finding the orbit of a body from three 
observations was devised by Newton and is given in the Principia. The 
most publicized result of applying Newton's method of orbit 
determination belongs to our old friend Sir Edmond Halley. 
In 1705, shortly after the publication of the Principia (1687), Halley 
set to work calculating the orbits of 24 comets which had been sighted 
between 1337 and 1698, using the method which Newton had 
described. Newton's arguments, presented in a condensed form, were so 
difficult to understand that of all his contemporaries only Halley was 
able to master his technique and apply it to the calculation of the orbits 
of those comets for which there was a sufficient number of 
51

observations. 
In a report on his findings published in 1705 he states: "Many 
considerations incline me to believe the comet of 1531 observed by 
Apianus to have been the same as that described by Kepler and 
Longomontanus in 1607 and which I again observed when it returned 
in 1682. All the elements agree; .... whence I would venture 
confident ly to predict its return, namely in the year 1758."2 
.In a later edition of the same work published in 1752, Halley 
confidently identified his comet with those that had appeared in 1305, 
1380 and 1456 and remarked, "wherefore if according to what we have 
already said it should return again about the year 1758, candid 
posterity will not refuse to acknowledge that this was first discovered 
by an Englishman. ,,2 
No one could be certain he was right, much less that it might not 
succumb to a churlish whim and bump into the earth. The realization 
that the stability of the earth's orbit depends "on a nice balance 
between the velocity with which the earth is falling toward the sun and 
its tangential velocity at right angles to that fall" did not unduly disturb 
the handful of mathematicians and astronomers who understood what 
that equilibrium meant. But there were many others, of weaker faith in 
arithmetic and geometry, who would have preferred a less precarious 
arrangement .3 
On Christmas day, 1758, Halley's comet reappeared, just as he said it 
would. Recent investigations have revealed, in ancient Chinese 
chronicles, an entire series of earlier appearances of Halley's comet-the 
earliest in 467 BC. The comet has appeared since in 1835 and 1910; its 
next visit is expected in 1986. 
Newton's method of determining a parabolic orbit from observations 
depended on a graphical construction which, by successive approxima ­
tions, led to the elements. The first completely analytical method for 
solving the same problem was given by Euler in 1744 in his Theory of 
the Motion of Planets and Comets. To Euler belongs the discovery of 
the equation connecting two radius vectors and the subtended chord of 
the parabola with the interval of time during which the comet describes 
the corresponding arc. 
Lambert, in his works of 1761 to 1771, gave a generalized 
formulation of the theorem of Euler for the cas e of elliptical and 
hyperbolic orbits. But Lambert was a geometrician at heart and was not 
inclined to analytical developme nt of his method. Nevertheless, he had 

<<<PAGE 68>>>

Sec. 2.2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS 53 
an unusual grasp of the physics of the problem and actually anticipated 
many of the ideas that were ultimately carried out by his successors in 
better and more convenient ways. 
Lagrange , who at age 16 was made Professor of Mathematics at 
Turin, published three memoirs on the theory of orbits, two in 1778 
and one in 1783. It is interestirig to note that the mathematical spark 
was kindled in the young Lagrange by reading a memoir of Halley. 
From the very first his writings were elegance itself; he would set to 
mathematics all the problems which his friends brought him, much as 
Schubert would set to music any stray rhyme that took his fancy. As 
one would expect, Lagrange brought to the incomplete theories of 
Euler and Lambert generality, precision, and mathematical elegance. 
In 1780 Laplace published an entirely new method of orbit 
determination. The basic ideas of his method are given later in this 
chapter and are still of fundamental importance. 
The theory of orbit determination was really brought to fruition 
through the efforts of the brilliant young German mathematician, 
Gauss, whose work led to the rediscovery of the asteroid Ceres in 1801 
after it had become "lost." Gauss also invented the "method of least 
squares" to deal with the problem of fitting the best possible orbit to a 
large number of observations. 
Today, with the availability of radar, the problem of orbit 
determination is much simpler. Before showing you how it is done, 
however, we must digress a moment to explain how the size, shape and 
orientation of an orbit in three dimensional space can be described by 
six quantities called "orbital elements." 
2.2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS 
Our first requirement for describing an orbit is a suitable inertial 
reference frame. In the case of orbits around the sun such as planets, 
asteroids, comets and some deep-space probes describe, the 
heliocentric-ecliptic coordinate system is convenient. For satellites of 
the earth we will want to use the geocentric-equatorial system. In order 
to describe these coordinate systems we will give the position of the 
origin, the orientation of the fundamental plane (i.e. the X-Y plane), 
the principal direction (i.e. the direction of the X-axis), and the 
direction of the Z-axis. Since the Z-axis must be perpendicular to the 
fundamental plane it is only necessary to specify which direction is 
positive. The Y-axis is always chosen so as to form a right-hand ed set of

2.2.1 The Heliocentric-Ecliptic Coordinate System. As the name 
implies, the heliocentric-ecliptic system has its origin at the center of 
the sun. The Xe -Ye or fundamental plane coincides with the "ecliptic" 
which is the plane of the earth's revolution around the sun. The 
line-of-intersection of the ecliptic plane and the earth's equatorial plane 
defines the direction of the Xe-axis as shown in Figure 2.2-1. On the 
first day of Spring a line joining the center of the earth and the center 
of the sun points in the direction of the positive Xe-axis. This is called 
the vernal equinox direction and is given the symbol Tby astronomers 
because it used to point in the direction of the constellation Aries (the 
ram). As you know, the earth wobbles slightly and its axis of rotation 
shifts in direction slowly over the centuries. This effect is known as 
precession and causes the line-of-intersection of the earth's equator and 
the ecliptic to shift slowly. As a result the heliocentric-ecliptic system is

not really an inertial reference frame and where extreme precision is 
required it would be necessary to specify that the )0(Z€ coordinates 
of an object were based on the vernal equinox direction of a particular 
year or "epoch.,,4 
2.2.2 The Geocentric-Equatorial Coordinate System. The geo­
centric-equatorial system has its origin at the earth's center. The 
fundamental plane is the equator and the positive X-axis points in the 
vernal equinox direction. The Z-axis points in the direction of the north 
pole. It is important to keep in mind when looking at Figure 2.2-2 that 
the )0(Z system is not fixed to the earth and turning with it; rather, the 
geocentric-equatorial frame is nonrotating with respect to the stars 
(except for precession of the equinoxes) and the earth turns relative to 
it. 
Unit vectors, J, J and K, shown in Figure 2.2-2, lie along the X, Y 
and Z axes respectively and will be useful in describing vectors in the 
geocentric-equatorial system. Note that vectors in this figure and in 
many others are designated by a bar over the letter, whereas they are

boldface in the text material. 
2.2.3 The Right Ascension-Declination System . A coordinate 
system closely related to the geocentric-equatorial frame is the right 
ascension-declination system. The fundamental plane is the "celestial 
equator" -the extension of the earth's equatorial plane to a fictitious 
sphere of infinite radius called the "celestial sphere." The position of an 
object projected against the celestial sphere is described by two angles 
called right ascension and declination. 
As shown in Figure 2.2-3, the right ascension, 01., is measured 
eastward in the plane of the celestial equator from the vernal equinox 
direction. The declination, 0, is measured northward from the celestial 
equator to the line-of-sight. 
The origin of the system may be at the center of the earth 
(geocenter) or a point on the surface of the earth (topocenter) or 
anywhere else. For all intents and purposes any point may be 
considered the center of the infinite celestial sphere. 
Astronomers use the right ascension-declination system to catalog 
star positions accurately. Because of the enormous distances to the 

<<<PAGE 72>>>

Sec. 2.2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS 57 
stars, their coordinates remain essentially unchanged even when viewed 
from opposite sides of the earth's orbit around the sun. Only a few stars 
are close enough to show a measurable parallax between observations 
made 6 months apart. 
Because star positions are known accurately to fractions of an 
arc-second, a photograph of an earth satellite against a star background 
can be used to determine the· topocentric right ascension and 
declination of the satellite at the time of observation. Orbit 
determination from such optical sightings of a satellite will be discussed 
in a later section. 
2.2.4 The Perifocal Coo{(linate System. One of the most convenien t 
coordinate frames for describing the motion of a satellite is the 
perifocal coordinate system. Here the fundamental plane is the plane of 
the satellite's orbit. The coordinate axes are named xW' ywand zW. 
The Xw axis points toward the periapsis; the y w axis is rotated 900 in 
the direction of orbital motion and lies in the orbital plane; the zwaxis 
along h completes the right-handed perifocal system. Unit vectors in the 
direction of xw' y wand zware called P, Q and W respectively.

<<<PAGE 73>>>

58 ORBIT DETERMINA TION FROM OBSERVATIONS Ch. 2 
definitions applied to the >0tZ€ axes. Another system, the 
topocentric-horizon coordinate system will be introduced in a later 
section. 
2.3 CLASSICAL ORBITAL ELEMENTS 
Five independent quantities called "orbital elements" are sufficient 
to completely describe the size, shape and orientation of an orbit. A 
sixth element is required to pinpoint the position of the satellite along 
the orbit at a particular time. The classical set of six orbital elements 
are defined with the help of Figure 2.3-1 as follows: 
1. a, semi-major axis-a constant defining the size of the conic orbit. 
2. e, eccentricit y-a constant defining the shape of the conic orbit. 
3. i, inclination-the angle between the K unit vector and the 
angular momentum vector, h. 
4. Q longitude of the ascending node-the angle, in the 
fundamental plane, between the I unit vector and the point where the 
satellite crosses through the fundamental plane in a northerly direction 
(ascending node) measured counterclockwise when viewed from the 
north side of the fundamental plane. 
5. w, argument of periapsis-the angle, in the plane of the satellite's 
orbit, between the ascending node and the periapsis point, measured in 
the direction of the satellite's motion. 
6. T, time of periapsis passage-the time when the satellite was at 
periapsis. 
The above definitions are valid whether we are describing the orbit 
of an earth satellite in the geocentric-equat orial system or the orbit of a 
planet in the heliocentric-ecliptic system. Only the definition of the 
unit vectors and the fundamental plane would be different. 
It is common when referring to earth satellites to use the term 
"argument of perigee" for w. Similarly , the term "argument of 
perihelion" is used for sun-centered orbits. In the remainder of this 
chapter we shall tacitly assume that we are describing the orbit of an 
earth satellite in the geocentric-equatorial system using IJK unit 
vectors. 
The list of six orbital elements defined above is by no means 
exhaustive. Frequently the semi-latus rectum, p, is substituted for a in 
the above list. Obviously , if you know a and e you can compute p. 
Instead of argument of periapsis, the following is sometimes used: 
n longitude of periapsis-the angle from I to periapsis measured

eastward to the ascending node (if it eXists) and then in the orbital 
plane to periapsis. If both nand Ware defined then 
, n=n+w.' (2.3-1) 
If there is no periapsis (circular orbit), then both W and n are 
undefined. 
Any of the following may be substituted for time of periapsis 
passage and would suffice to locate the satellite at to: 
va true anomaly at epoch-the angle, in the plane of the satellite's 
orbit, between periapsis and the position of the satellite at a particular 
time, to' called the "epoch."

orbit, between the ascending node (if it exists) and the radius vector to 
the satellite at time to' If wand V 0 are both defined then 
I Uo = w + Vo" (2.3-2) 
If there is no ascending node (equatorial orbit), then both wand Uo 
are undefined. £a true longitude at epoch-the angle between I and ro (the radius 
vector to the satellite at tJ measured eastward to the ascending node 
(if it exists) and then in the orbital plane to roo If n, wand va are all 
defined, then 
[£0 = n + w + Vo = n + Vo = n + Uo .1 (2.3-3) 
If there is no ascending node (equatorial orbit), then £0 = n + vo' If 
there is no periapsis (circular orbit), then £0 = n + uo' If the orbit is 
both circular and equatorial, £0 is simply the true angle from I to ro' 
both of which are always defined. 
Two other terms frequently used to describe orbital motion are 
"direct" and "retrogra de." Direct means easterly. This is the direction 
in which the sun, earth, and most of the planets and their moons rotate 
on their axes and the direction in which all of the planets revolve 
around the sun. Retrograde is the opposite of direct. From Figure 2.3-1 
you can see that inclinations between 00 and 900 imply direct orbits 
and inclinations between 900 and 1800 are retrograde.

2.4 DETERMINING THE ORBITAL ELEMENTS FROM r AND v 
Let us assume that a radar site on the earth is able to provide us with 
the vectors r and v representing the position and velocity of a satellite 
relative to the geocentri c-equatorial reference frame at a particular 
time, to. How do we find the six orbital elements which describe the 
motion of the satellite? The first step is to form the three vectors, h, n 
and e. 
2.4.1 Three Fundamental Vector s-h, nand e. We have already 
encountered the angular momentum vector, h. 
Thus h=rxv 
I J K h = rl rJ rK =hII+hl+hKK. 
vI vJ vK (2.4-1) 
(2.4-2) 
An important thing to remember is that h is a vector perpendicular 
to the plane of the orbit. 
The node vector, n, is defined as 
n=:Kxh·1 (2.4-3) 
Thus 
From the definition of a vector cross product, n must be 
perpendicular to both K and h. To be perpendicular to K, n would have 
to lie in the equatorial plane. To be perpendic ular to h, n would have to 
lie in the orbital plane. Therefore, n must lie in both the equatorial and 
orbital planes, or in their intersection which is called the "line of 

<<<PAGE 77>>>

62 ORBIT DETERMINATION FROM OBSERVATIONS Ch.2 
nodes." Specifically, n is a vector pointing along the line of nodes in the 
direction of the ascending node. The magnitude of n is of no 
consequence to us. We are only interested in its direction. 
The vector, e, is obtained from 
(2.4·5) 
and is derived in Chapter 1 (equation (l.S-11)). The vector e points 
from the center of the earth (focus of the orbit) toward perigee with a 
magnitude exactly equal to the eccentricity of the orbit. 
All three vectors, h, nand e are illustrated in Figure 2.3-1. Study this 
figure carefully. An understanding of it is essential to what follows. 
2.4.2 Solving for the Orbital Elements. Now that we have h, nand e 
we can proceed rather easily to obtain the orbital elements. The 
parameter, p, and eccentricity follow directly from hand e while all the 
remaining orbital elements are simply angles between two vectors 
whose component s are now known. If we know how to find the angle 
between two vectors the problem is solved. In general, the cosine of the 
angle, ex, between two vectors A and B is found by dotting the two 
vectors together and dividing by the product of their magnitud es. Since 
then A • B = AB cos a 
cosa = A.B 
AB (see Figure (2.4-1) (2.4-6) 
Of course, being able to evaluate the cosine of an angle does not mean 
that you know the angle. You still have to decide whether the angle is 
smaller or greater than 1800. The answer to this quadrant resolution 
problem must come from other information in the problem as we shall 
see. 
We can outline the method of finding the orbital elements as 
follows:

All of the quadrant checks in parentheses make physical sense. If 
they don't make sense to you, look at the geometry of Figure 2.3-1 and 
study it until they do. The quadrant check for Vo is nothing 
more than a method of determining whether the satellite is 
between periapsis and apoapsis (where flight-path angle is always 
positive) or between apoapsis and periapsis (where ¢ is always 
negative). With this hint see if you can fathom the logic of 
checking r • v. 
The three orbits illustrated in the following example problem 
should help you visualize what we have been talking about up to 
now.

In the last section we saw how to determine a set of classical orbital 
elements from the vectors r and V at some epoch. Now we will look at 
the inverse problem of determining r and V when the six classical 

<<<PAGE 87>>>

72 ORBIT DETERMI NATION FROM OBSERVATIONS Ch. 2 
elements are given. 
This is both an interesting and a practical exercise since it represents 
one way of solving a basic problem of astrodyna mics-that of updating 
the position and velocity of a satellite to some future time. Suppose 
you know ro and va at some time to. Using the techniques presented in 
the last section you could determine the elements p, 8, i, n, wand va. 
Of these six elements, the first five are constant (if we accept the 
assumptions of the restricted two-body problem) and only the true 
anomaly, v, changes with time. In Chapter 4 you will learn how to 
determine the change in true anomaly, lV, that occurs in a given time, t -to. This will enable you to construct a new set of orbital elements and 
the only step remaining is to determine the new r and v from this 
"updated" set. 
The method, shown below, consists of two steps; first we must 
express r and v in perifocal coordinates and then transform r and V to 
geocentric-equatorial component s. 
2.5.1 Expressing r and v in the Perifocal System. Let's assume that 
we know p,8, i, n, wand v. We can immediately write an expression 
for r in terms of the perifocal system (see Figure 2.24): 
I r = r cos v P + r sin v Q I (2.5 -1) 
where the scalar magnitude r can be determined from the polar 
equation of a conic: 
r = _--'P"-- __ 1 + 8 COS V (1.5-4) 
To obtain V we only need to differentiate r in equation (2.5-1) 
keeping in mind that the perifocal coordinate frame is "inertial" and so 
p= Q=Oand 
V = i =(rcos V -rv sin v)P+(r sin v + rv cos v)Q 
This expression for V can be Simplified by recognizing that h = r2v 
(see Figure 1.7-2)"p = h2 III and differentiating equation (1.5-4) above 
to obtain 
r =,ffesin V (2.5-2)

A vector may be expressed in any coordinate frame. It is common in 
astrodynamics to use rectangular coordinates although occasionally 
spherical polar coordinates are more convenient. A rectangular 
coordinate frame is usually defined by specifying its origin, its 
fundamental (x-y) plane, the direction of the positive z-axis, and the 
principal (x) direction in the fundamental plane. Three unit vectors are 
then defined to indicate the directions of the three mutually 
perpendicular axes. Any other vector can be expressed as a linear 
combination of these three unit vectors. This collection of unit vectors 
is commonly referred to as a "basis." 
2.6.1 What a Coordinate Transfonnation Does. A coordinate 
transformation merely changes the basis of a vector-nothing else. The 
vector still has the same length and direction after the coordinate 
transformation, and it still represents the same thing. For example, 
suppose you know the south, east, and zenith components of the 
"velocity of a satellite relative to the topocentric-horizon frame." The 
phrase in quotes describes what the. vector represents. The "basis" of 
the vector is obviously the set of unit vectors pointing south, east a!1d 
up. 
Now suppose you want to express this vector in terms of a different 
basis, say the IJK unit vectors of the geocentric-eq uatorial frame 
(perhaps because you want to add another vector to it and this other 
vector is expressed in IJK components). A simple coordinate 
transformation will do the trick. The vector will still have the same 
magnitude and direction and will represent the same thing, namely, the 
"velocity of a satellite relative to the topocentric-horizon frame" even 
though you now express it in terms of geocentric-equatorial 
coordinates. In other words, changing the basis of a vector does not 
change its magnitude, direction , or what it represents. 
A vector has only two properties that can be expressed 
mathematically-magnitude and direction. Certain vectors, such as 
position vectors, have a definite starting point, but this point of 
origin cannot be expressed mathematic ally and does not change in 
a coordinate transformation. For example, suppose you know the 
south, east, and zenith components of "the vector from a radar

site on the surface of the earth to a satellite." A simple change of basis 
will enable you to express this vector in terms of IJK components: 
The transformation did not change what the vector represents so it is 
still the vector "from the radar site to the satellite." In other words, 
expressing a vector in coordinates of a particular frame does not imply 
that the vector has its tail at the origin of that frame. 
2.6.2 Change of Basis Using Matrices. Changing from one basis to 
another can be streamlined by using matrix methods. Suppose we have 
two coordinate frames xyz and x' y' z' related by a simple rotation 
through a positive angle ex about the Z axis. Figure 2.6-1 illustrates the 
two frames. We will define a positive rotation about any axis by means 
of the "right-hand rule" -if the thumb of the right hand is extended in 
the direction of the positive coordinate axis, the fingers curl in the 
sense of a positive rotation. 
Let us imagine three unit vectors I, J and K extending along the x, y 
and z axes respectively and another set of unit vectors U, V and W 
along the x', y' and z' axes. Now suppose we have a vector a which may 
be expressed in terms of the IJK basis as 
(2.6-1) 

<<<PAGE 91>>>

76 ORBIT DETERMI NATION FROM OBSERVATiONS Ch. 2 
or in terms of the UVW basis as 
(2.6-2) 
From Figure 2.6-1 we can see that the unit vectors U, V and Ware 
related to I, J and K by the following set of equations: 
U = I (cos a)+ J(sin a)+ K (0) 
V = I(-sin a)+J(cosa)+ K(O) 
W = 1(0) +J(O) +K(1) (2.6-3) 
Substituting these equations into equation (2.6-2) above and 
equating it with (2.6-1) yields 
au = al (cosa)+aj(sina)+aK(O) 
aV = al(-sina)+aj(cosa)+aK(O) 
aW=al(O) +aj(O) +aK(1). (2.6-4) 
We can express this last set of equations very compactly if we use 
matrix notation and think of the vector a as a triplet of numbers 
representing a column matrix. We will use subscripts to identify the 
basis, thus 
The coefficients of ai_ aj and aK in equations (2.6-4) should be 
taken as the elements of a three by three "transformation matrix" 
which we can call A 
sin a cos a 
o (2.6-5)

The set of equations (2.6-4) can then be represented as 
aUVW =A alJK 
which is really matrix shorthand for 77 
(2.6-6)

Applying the rules of matrix multiplication to equation (2.6-7) 
yields the set of equations (2.6-4) above.

2.6.4 Successive Rotations About Several Axes. So far we have 
learned how to use matrices to perform a simple change of basis 
where the new set of unit vectors is related to the old by a 
simple rotation about one of the coordinate axes. Let us now 
look at a more complicated transformation involving more than 
one rotation. 
Suppose we know the IJK components of some general vector, 
a, in the geocentric-equatorial frame and we wish to find its SEZ 
components in the topocentric-horizon frame (see section 2.7.1). 
Figure 2.8-4 shows the angular relationship between two 
frames. Starting with the IJK frame we can first rotate it 
through a positive angle () about the Z (K) axis and then rotate it 
through a positive angle (900 -L) about the Y axis to bring it into 
angular alignment with the SEZ frame. 
The three components of a after the first rotation can be found from [COS () sin () 
-sin () cos () 
o 0 
The above expression is actually a column matrix and represents the 
three components of a in the intermediate frame. We can now multiply 
this column matrix by the appropriate matrix corresponding to the 
second rotation and obtain [' a�_ [in L 
aE -0 
aZ cos L o 
o -COS] [COS () 
o -sin () 
sin L 0 ::s: � �J 
Since matrix multiplication is associative we can multiply the two 
simple rotation matrices together to form a single transformation 
matrix and write

as sin L cos e sin L sin e -cos L al 
aE -Sin e cos e 0 aJ 
aZ cos L cos e cos L sin e sin L aK 
(2.6-11) 
Keep in mind that the order in which you multiply the two rotation 
matrices is important since matrix multiplication is not commutative , 
(i.e., AB =1= SA). Since matrix multiplication can represent rotation of 
an axis system we can infer from this that the order in which rotations 
are performed is not irrelevant. For example if you are in an airplane 
and you rotate in pitch 450 nose-up and then roll 900 right you will be 
in a different attitude than if you first roll 900 right and then pitch up 
450. 
Equation (2.6-11) represents the transformation from geocentric­
equatorial to topocentric coordinates. We can write equation (2.6-11) 
more compactly as 
where Dis the overall transformation matrix. 
Now, if we want to perform the inverse transformation (from 
topocentric to geocentric) we need to find the inverse of matrix D 
which we will call 0-1. 
In general the inverse of a matrix is difficult to calculate. 
Fortunately, all transformation matrices between rectangular frames 
have the unique property that they are orthogonal. 
A three-by-three matrix is called "orthogonal" if the rows and the 
columns are scalar components of mutually perpendicular unit vectors. 
The inverse of any orth,!2gonal matrix i�ual to its transpose. The 
transpose of the matrix D, denoted by D , is the new matrix whose 
rows are the old columns and whose columns are the old rows (in the 
same order). Hence

Having determined the elements of the rotation matrix, it only 
remains to find r and V in terms of IJK components. Thus 
and 
This method is not recommended unless other transformations are not 
practical. Often it is possible to go to the IJK frame using equations 
(2.5-1) and (2.5-4) with Pand Qknown in IJK coordinates. 
Special precautions must be taken when the orbit is equatorial or 
circular or both. In this case either nor w or both are undefined. In 
the case of the circular orbit v is also undefined so it is necessary to 
measure true anomaly from some arbitrary reference such as the 
ascending node or (if the orbit is also equatorial) from the unit vector I. 
Because of these and other difficulties the method of updating r and V 
via the classical orbital elements leaves much to be desired. Other more 
general methods of updating r and V that do not suffer from these 
defects will be presented in Chapter 4. 
2.7 ORBIT DETERMINATION FRO M A 
SINGLE RADAR OBSERVATION 
A radar installation located on the surface of the earth can measure 
the position and velocity of a satellite relative to the radar site. But the 
radar site is not located at the center of the earth so the position vector 
measured is not the r we need. Also the earth is rotating so the velocity 
of the satellite relative to the radar site is not the same as the velocity, 
V, relative to the center of the IJK frame which we need to compute the 
orbital elements. 
Before showing you how we can obtain r and V relative to the center 
of the earth from radar tracking data we must digress long enough to 
describe the coordinate system in which the radar site makes and 
expresses its measurements.

2.7.1 The Topocentric-Horizon Coordinate System. The origin of 
the topocentric-horizon system is the point on the surface of the earth 
(called the "topos") where the radar is located. The fundamental plane 
is the horizon and the Xh-axis points south. The Y h-axis is east and the 
Zh-axis is up. It seems hardly necessary to point out that the 
topocentric-horizon system is not an inertial reference frame since it 
rotates with the earth. The unit vectors S, E and Z shown in Figure 
2.7-1 will aid us in expressing vectors in this system. 
2.7.2 Expressing Position and Velocity Relative to the Topocentric­
Horizon Reference Frame. The radar site measures the range and 
direction to the satellite. The range· is simply the magnitude of the 
vector p (rho) shown in Figure 2.7-1. The direction to the satellite is 
determined by two angles which can be picked off the gimbal axes on 
which the radar antenna is mounted. The azimuth angle, Az, is 
measured clockwise from north; the elevation angle, EI, (not to be 
confused with U) is measured from the horizontal to the radar 
line-of-sight. If the radar is capable of detecting a shift in frequency in 
the returning ec ho (Doppler effect), the rate at which range is changing, 
p, can also be measured. The sensors on the gimbal axes are capable of 
measuring the rate-of-change of the azimuth and elevation an gles, AZ

and EO/, as the radar antenna follows the satellite across the sky. Thus, 
we have the raw material for expressing the position and velocity of the 
s�tellite relative to the radar in the six measurements:p, Az, EI, p, /l!L, 
EI. 
We will express the position vector as 
where, from the geometry of Figure 2.7-1, 
Ps = -P cos E 1 cos Az 
PE = P cos El sin Az 
Pz = P sin El. 
The velocity relative to the radar site is just p 
p = Ps S + PE E + PZ Z. (2.7-1) 
(2.7-2) 
(2.7-3) 
Differentiating equations (2.7-2) we get the three components of p: 
Ps = -p cos El cos Az t p sin EI(EI) cos Az + 
P cos EI sin Az(Az) 
PE = P cos EI sin Az -P sin EI(Bl) sin Az + 
P cos EI cos Az(Az) 
Pz. = P sin EI + P cos El(BI). 
(2.7-4) 
2.7.3 Position and Velocity Relative to the Geocentric Frame. 
There is an extremely simple relationship between the topocentric 
position vector p and the geocentric position vector r. From Figure 
2.7-2 we see that 
r = R + P (2.7-5) 
where R is the vector from the center of the earth to the origin of the

topocentric frame. If the earth were perfectly spherical then the Zh axis 
which defines the local vertical at the radar site would pass through the 
center of the earth if extended downward and the vector R would be 
R = r Z Ell 
where r Ell is the radius of the earth. (2.7-6) 
Unfortunat ely, things are not that simple and to avoid errors of 
several miles in the po sition of the radar site relative to the geocenter it 
is necessary to use a more accurate model for the shape of the earth. A 
complete discussion of determining R on an oblate earth is included 
later in this chapter. For the moment we will assume that equation 
(2.7 -6) is valid and proceed to the determination of v. 
The general method of determining velocity relative to a "fixed" 
frame (hereafter referred to as the "true" velocity) when you are 
given the velocity relative to a moving frame may be stated in 
words as follows:

The sketches shown in Figure 2.7-3 illustrate this general principle 
for both a translating and rotating frame. 
Figure 2.7-3 Relationship between relative and true velocity for 
translating and rotating reference frames 
If you visualize the three-dimensional volume of space (Figure 2.7-4) 
defined by the topocentric-horizon reference frame, you will see that 
every point in this frame moves with a different velocity relative to the 
center of the earth. If f is the position vector from the center of the 
earth to the satellite, the velocity of that point in the topocentric frame 
where the satellite is located is simply wEB X f, where � is the angular 
velocity of the earth (hence", the angular velocity of the SEZ frame). It 
is this velocity that must be added vectorially to p to obtain the "true" 
velocity v. Therefore, 
v = II + CO x f. EB (2.7-7) 
You may recognize this expression as a simple application of the 
Corio lis theorem which will be derived in the next section as the general 
problem of derivatives in moving coordinate systems is discussed.

2.7.4 Derivatives in a Moving Reference Frame. Let any vector A be 
defined as a function of time in a "fixed" coordi nate frame (x, y, z). 
Also let there be another coordinate system (u, v, w), rotating with 
respect to the (x, y, z) system (Figure2.7-5). At this point you should 
note that this analysis applies to the relative motion between any two 
coordinate systems. It is not necessary that one system be fixed in 
inertial space! 
The vector A may be expressed in either of these coordinate systems as 
., (2.7-8) 
FIXED ROTATING 
Differentiating equation (2.7-8) with respect to time leads to: 
dA • •• .. • � = AII+Ai+AKK+AII+Ai+AKK 
= AUD+AVV+AWW+AUV+AVV+AWW. (2.7-9) 
Now the unit vectors I, J, K may be moving with time if the "fixed" 
system is not inertial, however, if we specify the time derivative with 
respect to the ''fixed'' coordinate system, then 
I=J=K=O. 
The unit vectors D, V and W will move relative to the fixed system so 
that in general their derivatives are not zero. 
Assume that we know the angular velocity of the moving reference 
frame relative to the fixed frame. We will denote this quantity by w. 
Then using the results of the unit vector analysis we know that the time

derivative of a unit vector is perpendicular to the unit vector and has 
magnitude equal to w. You should prove to yourself that 
. . . U = w x U, V = w x V and W = w x W.

The first is present only when there is relative motion between the

2.8 SEZ TO IJ K TRANSFORMA nON USING 
AN ELLIPSOID EARTH MODEL 
To fully complete the orbit determination problem of the previous 
section we need to convert the vectors we have expressed in SEZ 
components to IJK components. We could simply use a spherical earth 
as a model and write the transformation matrix as discussed earlier. To 
be more accurate we will first discuss a nonspherical earth model. 
"Station coordinates" is the term used to denote the position of a 
tracking or launch site on the surface of the earth. If the earth were 
perfectly spherical, latitude and longitude could be considered as 
spherical coordinates with the radius being just the earth's radius plus 
the elevation above sea level. It is known, however, that the earth is not 
a perfect geometric sphere. Therefore, in order to increase the accuracy 
of our calculations, a model for the geometric shape of the earth must 
be adopted. We will take as our approximate model an oblate spheroid. 
The first Vanguard satellite showed the earth to be slightly pear-shaped 
but this distortion is so small that the oblate spheroid is still an 
excellent representation. 
We will discover that latitude can no longer be interpreted as a 
spherical coordinate and that the earth's radius is a function of latitude. 
We will find it most convenient to express the station coordinates of a 
point in terms of two rectangular coordinates and the longitude . (The 
interpretati on of longitude is the same on an oblate earth as it is on a 
spherical earth.) 
2.8.1 The Reference Ellipsoid. In the model which has been 
adopted, a cross section of the earth along a meridian is an ellipse 
whose semi-major axis, ae, is just the equatorial radius and whose 
semi-minor axis, be' is just the polar radius of the earth. Sections 
parallel to the equator are, of course, circles. Recent determinatio ns of 
these radii and the consequent eccentricity of the elliptical cross section 
are as follows: 

<<<PAGE 109>>>

94 ORBIT DETERMINATION FROM OBSERVATION 
Equatoria l radius (ae) == 6378.145 km 
Polar radius (be') == 6356.785 km 
Eccentricity (e) == 0.08182 Ch.2 
The reference ellipsoid is a good approximation to that hypothetical 
surface commonly referred to as "mean sea level." The actual mean sea 
level surface is called the "geoid" and it deviates from the reference 
ellipsoid slightly because of the uneven distribution of mass in the 
earth's interior. The geoid is a true equipotential surface and a plumb 
bob would hang perpendic ular to the surface of the geoid at every 
point. 
2.8.2 The Measurement of Latitude. While an oblate earth 
introduces no unique problems in the definition or measurement of 
terrestrial longitude, it does complicate the concept of latitude. 
Consider Figure 2.8-1. It illustrates the two most commonly used 
definitions of latitude. 
The angle L is called "geocentric latitude" and is defined as the 
angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the geocenter. 
The angle L is called "geodetic latitude" and is defined as the angle 
between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface of the 
ellipsoid. The word "latitude" usually means geodetic latitude. This is 
the basis for most of the maps and charts we use. The normal to the 
surface is the direction that a plumb bob would hang were it not for 
local anomalie s in the earth's gravitational fie ld. 
The angle between the equatorial plane and the actual "plumb bob 
vertical" uncorrected for these gravitational anomalies is called La the 
"astronomical latitude." Since the difference between the true geoid 
and our reference ellipsoid is slight, the difference between L and La is 
usually negligible. 
When you are given the latitude of a place, it is safe to assume that it 
is the geodetic latitude L unless otherwise stated. 
2.8.3 Station Coordinates. What we need now is a method of 
calculating the station coordinates of a point on the surface of our 
reference ellipsoid when we know the geodetic latitude and longitude 
of the point and its height above mean sea level (which we will take t6 
be the height above the reference ellipsoid). 
Consider an ellipse comprising a section of our adopted earth model

We will first determine the x and z coordinates of a point on the 
ellipse assuming that we know the geodetic latitude, L. It will then be a 
simple matter to adjust these coordinates for a point which is a known 
elevation above the surface of the ellipsoid in the direction of the 
normal. 
It is convenient to introduce the angle (3, the "reduced latitude," 
which is illustrated in Figure 2.8-2. The x and z coordinates can 
immediately be written in terms of (3 if we note that the ratio of the z 
ordinate of a point on the ellipse to the corresponding z ordinate of a 
point on the circumscri bed circle is just be / ae . Thus,

For a point which is a height H above the ellipsoid (which we take to 
be mean sea level), it is easy to show that the x and Z components of 
the elevation or height (H) normal to the adopted ellipsoid are 
�x = H cos L 
(2.8-6) 
�Z = H sin L. 
Adding these quantities to the relations for x and z we get the 
following expressions for the two rectangular station coordinates of a 
point in terms of geodetic latitude, elevation above mean sea level, and 
earth equatorial radius and eccentricity: 
x = e b a 1-e2 sin2 L + H I cos L 
(2.8-7) 
The third station coordinate is simply the east longitude of the 
point. If the Greenwich sidereal time, {1q' is known, it can be combined 
with east longitude to find local sidereal time, {1. The x and Z 
coordinates plus the angle {1 complete ly locate the observer or launch 
site in the geocentric-equatorial frame as shown below.

2.8.4 Transforming a Vector From SEZ To IJK Components. The 
only remaining problem is how to convert the vectors which we have

Recall that the geodetic latitude of the radar site, L, is the angle 
between the equa torial plane and the extension of the local vertical at 
the radar site (on a spherical or oblate ea rth). Although Figure 2.8-4 
shows a spherical earth, the transformation matrix derived as follows is 
equally valid for an ellipsoid earth model where L is the geodetic 
latitude of the site. 
The angle between the unit vector I (vernal equinox direction) and 
the Greenwic h meridian is called 8g-the "greenwich sidereal time." If 
we let AE be the geographic longitude of the radar site measured 
eastward from Greenwich, then 
Ie:::: 8g + AE I (2.8-9) 
where 8 is called "local sidereal time." 
The angles Land 8 completely determine the relationship between 
the IJK frame and the SEZ frame. Obviously we need a method of 
determining 8 at some general time t. 
If we knew 8QO at some particular time to (say Oh Universal Time

2.9 mE MEASUREMENT OF TIME 
Time is used as a fundamental dime nsion in almost every branch of 
science. When a scientist or layman uses the terms "hours, minutes or 
seconds" he is understood to mean units of mean solar time. This is the 
time kept by ordinary clocks. Since we will need to talk about another 
kind of time called "sidereal" time, it will help to understand exactly 
how each is defined. 
2.9.1 Solar and Sidereal Time. It is the sun more than any other 
heavenly body that governs our daily activity cycle; so, it is no wonder 
that ordinary time is reckoned by the sun. The time between two 
successive upper transits of the sun across our local meridian is called an 
apparent solar day. The earth has to turn through slightly more than 
one complete rotation on its axis relative to the "fixed" stars during 
this interval. The reason is that the earth travels about 1/365th of the 
way around its orbit in one day. This should be made clear by Figure 
2.9-1. 
A sidereal day consisting of 24 sidereal hours is defined as the time 
required for the earth to rotate once on its axis relative to the stars. 
This occurs in about 23h 56m 4s of ordinary solar time and leads to the 
following relationships: 
1 day of mean solar time = 1.0027379093 days of mean sidereal time 
= 24h03m56�55536 of sidereal time 
= 86636.55536 mean sidereal seconds 

<<<PAGE 117>>>

1 day of mean sidereal time = .9972695664 days of solar time 
= 23h56m04�09054 of mean solar time 
= 86164.09054 mean solar seconds. 
So far, we have really defined only sidereal time and "apparent" 
solar time. Based on the definition of an apparent solar day illustrated 
in the figure, no two solar days would be exactly the same length 
because the earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit 
and because the earth's orbit is slightly elliptical. In early January, 
when the earth is near perihelion, it moves farther around its orbit in 1 
day than it does in early July when it is near aphelion. In order to avoid 
this irregularity in the length of a solar day, a mean solar day is defined 
based on the assumption that the earth is in a circular orbit 
whose period matches the actual period of the earth and that the 
axis of rotation is perpendicular to the orbital plane. An ordinary 
clock which ticks off 24 hours in one mean solar day would 
show the sun arriving at our local meridian a little early at 

<<<PAGE 118>>>

Sec. 2.9 THE MEASUREMENT OF TIME 103 
certain times of the year and a little late at other times of the 
year. 
2.9.2 Local Mean Solar Time and Universal Time. The earth is 
divided into 24 time zones approximately 150 of longitude apart. The 
local mean solar time in each zone differs from the neighboring zones 
by 1 hour. (A few countries have adopted time zon es which differ by 
only 1/2 hour from the adjacent zones.) 
The local mean solar time on the Greenwich meridian is called 
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), Universal Time (UT), or Zulu (Z) time. 
A time given in terms of a particular time zone can be converted to 
Universal Time by simply adding or subtracting the correct number of 
hours. For example, if it -is 1800 Eastern Standard Time (EST) the 
Universal Time is 2300. The conversion for time zones in the United 
States is as follows: 
EST +5 hrs=UT 
CST + 6 hrs = UT 
MST + 7 hrs = UT 
PST + 8 hrs = UT 
2.9.3 Finding the Greenwich Sidereal Time when Universal Time is 
Known. Often it is desired to relate observations made in the 
topocentric-horizon system to the IJK unit vectors of the 
geocentric-eq uatorial system and vice versa. The geometric al relation­
ship between these two systems depends on the latitude and longitude 
of the topos and the Greenwich sidereal time, 0g' (expressed as an 
angle) at the date and time of the observation. This relationship 
is illustrated on page 99. 
What we need is a convenient way to calculate the angle Og 
for any date and time of day. If we knew what Og was on a 
particular day and time we could calculate Og for any future 
time since we know that in one day the earth turn s through 
1.0027379093 complete rotations on its axis. 
Suppose we take the value of Og at at UT on 1 January of a 
particular year and call it 0go' Also, let us number the days of 
the year consecutively beginning with 1 January as day O. Thus,

2.9.4 Precession of the Equinoxes. To understand what the values 
of 8g in the table preceeding represent, it is necessary to discuss the 
slow �ifting of the vernal equinox direction known as precession. 
The direction of the equinox is determined by the line-of­
intersection of the ecliptic plane (the plane of the earth's orbit) 
and the equatorial plane.

I 
Figure 2.9-2 Precession of the equinoxes 
While the plane of the ecliptic is fixed relative to the stars, the 
equatorial plane is not. Due to the asphericity of the earth, the sun 
produces a torque on the earth which results in a wobbling or 
precessional motion similar to that of a simple top. Because the earth's 
equator is tilted 23*0 to the plane of the ecliptic, the polar axis sweeps 
out a cone-shaped surface in space with a semi-vertex angle of 23*0. As 
the earth's axis precesses, the line-of-int ersection of the equator and the 
ecliptic swings we stward slowly. The period of the precession is about 
26,000 years, so the equinox direction shifts westward about 50 
arc-seconds per year. 
The moon also produces a torque on the earth's equatorial bulge. 
However , the moon's orbital plane precesses due to solar perturbation 
with a period of about 18.6 years, so the lunar-caused precession has 
this same period. The effect of the moon is to superimp ose a slight 
nodding motion called "nutation," with a period of 18.6 years, on the 
slow westward precession caused by the sun.

The mean equinox is the position of the equinox when solar 
precession alone is taken into account. The appare nt equinox is the 
actual equinox direction when both precession and nutation are 
included. 
The values of 8g in the table preceding are referred to the mean 
equinox and equatolbf the dates shown.

The Gibbs problem can be stated as follows: Given three nonzero

of an orbiting object on one pass, find the parameter p and the

There are a number of other derivations of the Gibbsian method of 
orbit determination, but all of them have some problems like quadrant 
resolution which makes computer implementation difficult. This 
method, using the stated tests, appears to be foolproof in that there are 
no known special cases. 
There are several general features of the Gibbsian method worth 
noting that set it apart from other methods of orbit determination. 
Earlier in this chapter we noted that six independent quantities called 
"orbital elements" are needed to completely specify the size, shape and 
orientation of an orbit and the position of the satellite in that orbit. By 
specifying three position vectors we appear to have nine independent 
quantities-three components for each of the three vectors-from which 
to determine the six orbital elements. This is not exactly true. The fact 
that the three vectors must lie in the same plane means that they are 
not independent. 
Another interesting feature of the Gibbsian method is that it is 
purely geometrical and vectorial and makes use of the theorem that 
"one and only one conic section can be drawn through three coplanar 
position vectors such that the focus lies at the origin of the three 

<<<PAGE 130>>>

Sec. 2.10 DETERMI NATION FROM POSITION VECTORS 115 
position vectors." Thus, the only feature of orbital motion that is 
exploited is the fact that the path is a conic section whose focus is the 
center of the earth. The time-of-flight between the three positions is 
not used in the calculations. If we make use of the dynamical equation 
of motion of the satellite it is possible to obtain the orbit from only 
two position vectors, r1 and r2, and the time-of-flight between these 
positions. This is such an important problem that we will devote 
Chapter 5 entirely to its solution. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM . Radar observations of an earth satellite 
during a single pass yield in chronological order the following positions

The same equations used above are very efficient for use in a computer 
solution to problems of this type. Another approach is to immediately 
solve for v2 and then use f2' v2 and the method of section 2.4 to solve 
for the elements.

2.11 ORBIT DETERMINATION FROM OPTICAL SIGHTINGS 
The modern orbit determination problem is made much simpler by 
the availability of radar range and range-rate information. However the 
angular pointing accuracy and resolution of radar sensors is far below 
that of optical sensors such as the Baker-Nunn camera. As a result, 
optical methods still yield the most accurate preliminary orbits and 
some method of orbit determination proceeding from angular da ta only 
(e.g. topocentric right ascension and declination) is required. 
Six independent quantities suffice to completely specify a satellite's 
orbit. These may be the six classical orbital elements or they may be 
the six components of the 'lectors r and V at some epoch. In either case, 
an optical observation yields only two independent quantities such as 
EI and Az or right ascension and declination, so a minimum of three 
observations is required at three different times to determine the orbit. 
Since astronomers had to determine the orbits of comets and minor 
planets ( asteroids) using angular data only, the method presented below 
has been in long use and was first sugge sted by Laplace in 1780.6 
2:11.1 Determining the Line of Sight Unit Vectors. Let us assume 
that we have the topocentric right ascension and declination of a 
satellite at three separate times, (X1' <\ ' �, °2, (X3' <\ . These could 
easily be obtained from a photograph of the satellite against the star 
background. If we let L1, L.z and � be unit vectors along the 
line-of-sight to the satellite at the three observation times, then 
Lj =[�;J = [::: :: :;:S :J: 
LK. Sin OJ 
I j , j = 1, 2, 3, (2.11-1) 
Now since Lj are unit vectors directed along the slant range vector 15 
from the observation site to the satellite, we may write 
r = pL + R (2.11-2) 
where subscripts have been omitted for simpliCity and where p is the 
slant range to the satellite, r is the vector from the center of the earth 
to the satellite, and R is the vector from the center of the earth to the 
observation site (see Figure 2.7-2).

2.11.2 Derivatives of the Line-of-Sight Vector. Since we have the 
value of Lat.three t�es, t}, t2 and t3, we can numerically differentiate 
to obtain Land L at the central date, t2, provided the three 
observations are not too far apart in time. We may use the Lagrange 
interpolation formula to write a general analytical expression for Las a 
function of time:

By setting t = t2 ip equati.ons (2.11-6) and (2.11-7) we can obtain 
numerical values for Land L at the central date. It should be noted, 
however, that if more than three observations are available, a more 
accurate value of Land Lat the central date may be obtained by fitting 
higher order polynomials with the Lagrange interpolation formula to 
the observations or, better yet, making a least squares polynomial fit to 
the observations. This, in fact, must be done if L and higher order 
derivatives are not negligible.4 
Equation (2.11-5) written for the central date now represents three 
component equations in four unknowns, p, p, p' and r.

Provided that the determinant of the coefficients, 0, is not zero we 
have succeeded in solving for p as a function of the still unknown r. The 
conditions that result in 0 being zero will be discussed in a later 
section. 
From geometry we know that p and r are related by 
I r = pL + RI 
Dotting this equation into itself yields 
r2 = p 2 + 2p L . R + R 2 (2.11-2)

Equations (2.11-10) and (2.11-11) represent two equations in two 
unknowns, p and r. Substituting equation (2.11-10) into (2.11-11) leads 
to an eighth order equation in r which may be solved by iteration. 
Once the value of r at the central date is known equation (2.11-10) 
may be solved for p and the vector r obtained from equation (2.11-2).

Since we already know r we can solve equation (2.11-13) for p. To

2.11.5 Vanishing of the Detennina nt, D. In the pre­
ceding analysis we have assumed that the determinant D is not zero 
so that Cramer's rule may be used to solve for p and p. Moulton 7 has 
shown that D will be zero only if the three observations lie along the 
arc of a great circle as viewed from the observation site at time t2. This 
is another way of saying that if the observer lies in the plane of the 
satellite's orbit at the central date, Laplace's method fails. 
A somewhat better method of orbit determination from optical 
sightings will be presented in Chapter 5. 
2.12 IMPROVING A PRELIMINARY ORBIT BY DIFFERENTIAL 
CORRECT ION 
The preceding sections dealt with the problem of determining a 
preliminary orbit from a minimum number of observations. This 
preliminary orbit may be used to predict the position and velocity of 
the satellite at some future date. As a matter of fact, one of the first 
things that is done when a new satellite is detected is to compute an 
ephemeris for the satellite so that a downrange tracking station can 
acquire the satellite and thus improve the accuracy of the preliminary 
orbit by making further observations. 
There are two ways in which further observations of a satellite may 
be used to improve the orbital elements. If the downrange station can 
get an?ther "six-dimensional fix" on the satellite, such as P, P, El, El, 
k, Az or three optical sightings of aI' °1, a2, °2, a3, °3, then a 
complete redetermination of the orbital elements can be made and the 
new or "improved" orbital elements taken as the average of all 

<<<PAGE 138>>>

Sec. 2.12 IMPRO VING A PRELIMIN ARY ORBIT 123 
preceding determinations of the elements. 
It may happen, however, that the downrange station cannot obtain 
the type of six-dimensional fix required to redetermine the orbital 
elements. For example, a future observation may consist of six closely 
spaced observations of range-rate only. The question then arises, "can 
this information be used to improve the accuracy of the preliminary 
orbit?" The answer is "yes." By using a technique known as 
"differential correction" any six or more subsequent observations may 
be used to improve our knowledge of the orbital elements. 
2.12.1 Computing Residuals. Differential correction is based upon 
the concept of residuals. A residual is the difference between an actual 
observation and what the ·observation would have been if the satellite 
traveled exactly along the nominal orbit. Because such a nominal 
orbit will not be exactly correct due to sensor errors or uncertainty in 
the original observation station's geographical coordinates, the 
observational data collected by a downrange station (e.g. Doppler 
range-rate,p) will differ from the computed data. 
Suppose that the six components of ro and Vo are taken as the 
preliminary orbital elements of a satellite at some epoch to' Now 
assume that by some analytical method based on two-body orbital 
mechanics or some numerical method based on perturbation theory we 
can predict that the range-rates relative to some downrange observing 
site will be at six times, \ ' t2, t3, t4, ts and t6' These predictions are, 
of course, based on the assumption that the six nominal elements 
[r" rJ, rK' v" vJ, vKl at t =toare correct. 
The downrange station now makes its observations of p at the six 
prescribed times and forms a set of six residuals based on the difference 
between the predicted values of Ii and the actual observations. The six 
residuals are �1' ;::"P2' ;::"P3, ;::"P4, ;::"Ps' and �6' 
2.12.2 The Differential Correction equations. Assuming that the 
residuals are small, we can write the following six first-order equations 
(2.12-1) 

<<<PAGE 139>>>

124 ORBIT DETERMI NATION FROM OBSERVATION Ch. 2 
Assuming that the partial derivatives can be numerically evaluated, 
equations (2.12-1) constitute a set of six simultaneous linear equations 
in six unknowns, NI,Nj, NK,D.VI,D.Vj' D.VK . Using matrix methods 
these equations can be inverted and solved for the correction terms 
which will then be added to the preliminary orbital elements yielding a 
"corrected" or "improved" set of orbital elements 
These corrected elements are then used to recompute the predicted 
range-rates at the six observation times. New residuals are formed and 
the whole process repeated until the residuals cease to become smaller 
with further iterations. In essence the differential correction process is 
just a six-dimensional Newton iteration where we are trying, by trial 
and error, to find the value of the orbital elements at time to that will 
correctly predict the observations, i.e., reduce the residuals to zero. 
2.12.3 Evaluation of Partial Derivative s. The inversion of equations 
(2.12-1) requires a knowledge of all 36 partial derivatives such as ap1/ 
arl' etc. Usually it is impossible to obtain such derivatives analytically. 
With the aid of a digital computer, however, it is a simple matter to 
obtain them numerically. All that is required is to introduce a small 
variation, such as N I' to each of the original orbital elements i? turn 
and compute the resulting variation in each of the predicted p's. (A 
variation of 1 or 2 percent in the original elements is usually sufficient.) 
Then, for example, 
ap1 -;:::/1 (rl +N I' rj, r K"'" vK)-p1(rl, rj, ... , VK) . 
arl D.rl 
Although the preceding analysis was based on using range-rate data 
to differentially correct an orbit, the general method is valid no matter 
what type of data the residuals are based upon. The only requirement is 
that at least six independent observations are necessary. The following 
example problems demonstrate the use of the method. 
The following notation will be used in the following examples of 
differential correction: n = number of observations 
p= number of elements (parameters in the equation, usually 6 for 
orbit problems)

W is an n x n diagonal matrix whose elements consist of the

If p> n we do not have enough data to solve the problem. 
If p = n the result is a set of simultaneous equations that can be 
solved explicitly for the exact solution. 
If p < n we have more equations than we do unknowns so there is 
no unique solution. In this case we seek the best solution in a 
"least-squares" sense. This means we find the curve that causes the sum 
of the squares of the residuals to be a minimum. Or equivalently we 
minimize the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squared 
residuals, called the root mean square (RMS). This can occur even 
though the curve may not pass through any points. 
The solution to weighted least squares iterative differential 
correction is given by the following equation:

Follow this procedure: 
1. Solve equation (2.12-2) for the changes to the elements. 
2. Correct the elements (�EMI = aold + M). 
3. Compute new residuals using the same data with new elements. 
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 until the residuals are:

Notice that we achieved the exact result in one iteration. This is not 
surprising since our equation is that of a straight line and we used only 
two points. 
The relationships between the orbit elements and components of 
position and velocity are very nonlinear. In practice, large numbers of 
measurements are used to determine the orbit. This means that in a 
realistic problem 100 x 6 or larger matrices (100 observations, 6 orbit 
elements) would be used. This obviously implies the use of a digital 
computer for the solution. To illustrate the method involved, we will 
use a simple, yet still nonlinear relationship for our "elements" and a 
small, yet still overspecified number of measurements. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. Let the elements be ex and f3 in the 
relationship: 
Y = exxf3 (p=2) 
Given the following measurements of equal confidence, let us assume

RMS residual of 1.582. 
We will consider our RMS residual to be a minimum if its value on 
two successive iterations differs by less than 0.001. This is not yet the 
case so we iterate again. The next values of the parameter are: 
a = .735 [3 = 3.038. 
This time the RMS residual is 1.581, which means that to three

This best relationship between the given data and our fitting 
equation is given by 
y = 0.735 x3.038 
2.12.4 Unequally Weighted Data. If the data is not weighted equally 
we can observe several things: 
First: If a piece of data that is actually exact should be weighted less 
than other good data, the algorithm above will still converge to the 
same best value but it will take more iterations. 
Second: Weighting incorrect data less than the other data will cause 
the final values of the elements to be much closer to the values 
obtained using correct data than if the bad data had been weighted 
equally. However, the RMS residual value is larger the lower the weight 
given the bad data. The number of iterations needed for convergence 
increases the lower the weight. 
2.13 SPACE SURVEILLANCE 
In the preceding sections we have seen how, in theory, we can deter­
mine the orbital elements of a satellite from only a few observations. In 
practice, however, a handful of observations on new orb iting 0 bje cts can't 
secure the degree of precision needed for orbital surveillance and predic­
tion. Typical requirements are for 100-200 observations per object per 
day during the first few days of orbit, 20-50 observations per object per 
day to update already established orbits, and finally, during orbital decay, 
200-300 observations to confirm and locate reentry.8 
In 1975 there were nearly 3,500 detected objects in orbit around the 
earth. By 1980 this number is expected to grow to about 5,000.

2.13.1 The Spacetrack System. The task of keeping track of this 
growing space population belongs to the 14th Aerospace Force of the 
Aerospace Defense Command. The data needed to identify and 
catalogue orbiting objects comes from a network of electronic and 
optical sensors scattered around the world and known as the "496L 
Spacetrack System." Spacetrack is a synthesis of many systems: it 
receives inputs from the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System 
(BMEWS), the Electronic Intelligence System (EUNT), the Navy's 
Space Surveillance System (SPASUR), and over-the-horizon radars 
(OTH). In addition, other sensors are available on an on-call basis: 
observations are received from the Eastern and Western Test Ranges, 
the White Sands Missile Range, the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory's optical tracking network, and from Air Force Cambridge 
Research Laboratories' Millstone Hill radar. 
In addition to just catalogUing new space objects the mission of 
Spacetrack has been extended to reconnaissance satellite payload 
recovery, antisatellite targeting, manned spacecraft/debris collision 
avoidance, spacecraft failure diagnosis, and midcourse ICBM inter­
ception. At present, the greatest effort is being expended on just 
keeping track of the existing space traffic-a job made more difficult by 
the Soviet's accidental or deliberate explosion in orbit of satellites and 
boosters, forming "clouds" of space debris. 
2.14 TYPE AND LOCATION OF SENSORS 
Since space surveillance is an outgrowth of ballistic trajectory 
monitoring, it is not surprising that all of our radar sensors are located 
in the Northern Hemisphere. Satellite tracking cameras deployed 
around the world by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) 
in support of the recent International Geophysical Year (IGY) provide 
the data from the Southern Hemisphere. 
2.14.1 Radar Sensors. Radar sensors can be broadly categorized into 
two types: detection fans and trackers. The detection fans-most of 
which are part of the BMEWS system-consist of two horizontal 
fan-shaped beams, about lOin width and 3�0 apart in elevation sent 
out from football-field-size antennas. The horizontal sweep rate is fast 
enough that a missile or satellite cannot pass through the fans 
undetected. These detection radars with a range of 2,500-3,500 miles 
make about 12,000 observations per day-mostly of already catalogued 
objects. If an "unknown" ballistic object is detected, the precomputed 

<<<PAGE 148>>>

Sec. 2.14 TYPE AND LOCATION OF SENSORS 133 
impact area is determined by a "table look-up" procedure at the site 
based on where the object crossed the two fans and the elapsed time 
interval between fan crossings, 
At present there are two FPS-I7 detection radars at Diyarbakir, 
Turkey, and three more at Shemya in the Aleutians, Four of the larger 
FPS-50s are deployed at Thule, Greenland, while three are located at 
Clear, Alaska, One of the earlier detection radars, the FPS-43, at the 
Trinidad site of the Eastern Test Range, is now on active Spacetrack 
alert. The only other detection fan which supplies occasional data to 
Spacetrack on request is located at Kwajalein Island, 
Figure 2.14-1 BMEWS diagram 
The best orbit determination data on new satellites comes from the 
tracking radars scattered around the Spacetrack net. There is usually 
one tracker associated with each detection radar that can quickly 
acquire a new target from a simple extrapolation of its track through 
the detection fans, A typical tracker such as the FPS-49 has an 85-foot 
mechanically-steered dish antenna weighing 106 tons and is capable of 
scan rates up to 100 per second,s The prototype is located at 
Moorestown, New Jersey, and is on active spacetrack alert. One FPS-49

Figure 2.14-2. This BMEWS station at Clear, Alaska, uses a combination 
of one RCA FPS-92 tracker, under the 140-ft radome at the left, plus 
three GE FPS-50 detection radars which stand 165 ft high and 400 ft 
long. BMEWS which has other sites at Thule and Fylingdales Moor 
supplies data on orbiting satellites to Spacetrack regularly. 
is at Thule and three are at Fylingdales Moor in Yorkshire, United 
Kingdom. An advanced version of this tracker (the FPS-92) featuring 
more elaborate receiver circuits and hydrostatic bearings is operating at 
Clear, Alaska. 
In addition, there is an FPS-79 at Diyarbakir and an FPS·80 at 
Shemya. The one at Diyarbakir has a unique feature which enhances its 
spacetrack usefulness. A variable-focus feed horn provides a wide beam 
for detection and a narrow beamwidth for tracking. Pulse compression 
is used to improve both the gain and resolution of the 35-foot dish 
antenna. 
An interesting new development in tracking radars is the FPS-85 
with a fixed "phased-array" antenna and an electronically-steered 
beam. The prototype located at Eglin AFB, Florida, gives radar 
coverage of the Caribbean area. It is capable of tracking several targets 
simultaneously. 
One other radar sensor that contributes to the Spacetrack System is

over·the·horizon radar with transmitters located in the Far East and 
receivers scattered in Western Europe. OTH radar operates on the 
principle of detecting launches and identifying the signature of a 
particular booster by the disturbance it causes in the ionosphere. 
2.14.2 Radio Interferometers. Another class of sensors which 
provide accurate directional information on a satellite is based on the 
principle of radio interferometry. The original system using this 
technique was Minitrack-used to track Vanguard. It was a passive 
system requiring radio transmitters aboard the satellite. The Navy's 
SPASUR net is an active system of three transmitters and six receiving 
antennas stretching across the country along 330 N latitude from 
California to Georgia. The transmitters send out a continuous carrier 
wave at 108 Mc in a thin vertical fan. When a satellite passes through 
this "fence" a satellite reflected signal is received at the ground. The 
zenith angle of arrival of the signal is measured precisely by a pair of 
antennas spaced along the ground at the receiving site. When two or

more recelvmg sites are used, the position of the satellite passing 
through the fence is determined by triangulation. To obtain a 
preliminary orbit from the first pass through the fence the rate of 
change of phase between the most widely spaced antenna pairs in the 
East-West and North-South directions is used to determine the velocity 
vector.9 An orbit obtained in this way is very crude, but is useful in 
predicting the next pass through the system. After the second pass a 
refinement can be made as the period, and therefore, the semi-major 
axis, is well established. These observations give information from only 
one part of the satellite orbit, but after 12 hours the earth rotates the 
system under the "backside" of the orbit allowing further improvement 
of the orbital elements. Considering the type of observational data 
received, SP ASUR is best utilized in the role of updating already 
established orbits by differential correction techniques. 
2.14.3 Optical Sensors. SAO operates more than a dozen optical 
tracking stations around the world, each equipped with a Baker-Nunn 
telescopic camera. In addition to these, two Baker-Nunns are operated 
by 14th Aerospace Force at Edwards AFB and Sand Island in the 
Pacific, and the RCAF operates one at Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada. The 
Baker-Nunn instrument is an F/1 Schmidt camera of 20-inch focal

length with a field of view 50 by 300. The camera alternately tracks the 
satellite and then the star background. A separate optical system 
superimposes, on the same strip of Cinemascope film, the image of a 
crystal-controlled clock which is periodically illuminated by strobe 
lights to establish a time reference. From the photograph the position 
(topocentric right ascension and declination) of the satellite can be 
accurately determined by comparison with the well-known positions of 
the background stars. 1 0 
Under favorable conditions, the instrument can photograph a 16th 
magnitude object; it recorded the 6-inch diameter Vanguard I at a 
distance of 2,400 miles. 
Despite the high accuracy and other desirable features, the 
Baker-Nunn data has certain inherent disadvantages. For a good 
photograph the weather must be favorable, seeing conditions must be 
good, and the lighting correct. The latter condition means the site must 
be in darkness and the satellite target in sunlight. As a result, it is 

<<<PAGE 153>>>

138 ORBIT DETERM INATION FROM OBSERVATION Ch. 2 
usually impossible to get more than a few observations of the orbit at a 
desired point for any particular spacecraft. Further, precise data 
reduction cannot be done in the field and, in any case, takes time. 
One possibility of reducing the data processing time is with an image 
orthicon detector coupled to the Schmidt telescope by fiber optics. 
This would theoretically allow real-time analysis of the tracking data 
and is under development at the Cloudcroft, New Mexico site. 
In any case, the Baker-Nunn cameras provide one of the few sources 
of data from the Southern Hemisphere and are extensively used for 
calibration of the radar sensors in the Spacetrac k net. 
2.14.4 Typical Sensor Errors. With all the radar trackers located in 
the Nonhern Hemisph ere, it is not surprising that the predicted 
position of a new satellite after one revolution can be in error by as 
much as 110 km.8 An in-track error of this amount would make the 
satellite nearly 15 seconds early or late in passing through a detection 
fan or the SPASUR fence. Several factors combine to make these 
first-pass residuals large. (A residual is the difference between some 
orbital coordinate predicted on the basis of the preliminary orbital 
elements and the measured value of that coordinate.) Sensor errors 
themselves contribute to the residuals. For detection radars, satellite 
position uncertainties can be as high as 5,000 meters, while for tracking 
radars the uncertainty can vary from 100 to 500 meters depending on 
whether they use pulse compression. Doppler range-rate information, 
on the other hand, is relatively accurate. Radial velocity uncertainties 
may be as low as 1/6 meter/sec. I I Most of the Spacetrac k radars can 
achieve pointing accuracies of 36 arc-seconds. I I The 120·foot dish of 
the Millstone Hill tracker is good to 18 arc-seconds. I 2 Unfortunately 
radar sensors need almost constant recalibration to maintain these 
accuracies. 
The radio interferometer technique (Minitrack, SPASUR) yields 
directional information accurate to 20-40 seconds of arc and time of 
passage through the radio fence accurate to 2-4 milliseconds. I I 
The most accurate angUlar fix is obtained from Baker-Nunn camera 
data. On-site film reduction is accurate to only 30 seconds of arc but 
films sent to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for laboratory analysis yield 
satellite positions accurate to 3 arc-seconds. I 3 
Another source of sensor inaccurac y is the uncertainty in the 
geodetic latitude and longitude of the tracking site. These uncertainties 
contribute 30-300 meters of satellite prediction error.

Figure 2.14-6. The RCA TRADEX instrumentation radar on Kwajalein. 
Both TRADEX and Millstone Hill are called upon for Space track 
sightings although they are assigned to other projects. 
Even if all sensor errors could be eliminated, persistant residuals of 
about 5 km in position or 0.7 seconds in time would remain. The 
persistant residue levels are due to departures from two-body orbital 
motion caused by the earth's equatorial bulge, nonuniform gravitational 
fields, lunar attraction, solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag. 
Although general and special perturbation techniques are used to 
account for these effects, more accurate models for the earth and its 
atmosphere are needed to reduce the residuals still further. 
2.14.5 Future Developments. Some of the most sophisticated 
instrumentation radar in the world is now operating or is scheduled for 
the radar complex at Kwajalein atoll in the Pacific. 
The TRADEX (Target Resolution and Discrimination Experiments ) 

<<<PAGE 155>>>

140 ORBIT DETERMIN ATION FROM OBSE RVATION Ch. 2 
system at Roi Namur is a highly sensitive 84-foot tracker which 
operates in three radar bands, providing test data on multiple targets at 
extreme range. Not only can this radar detect and track a number of 
targets simultaneous ly, but it also records target tracks for later 
playback . 
The ALTAIR (ARPA Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation 
Radar) system is an advanced version of TRADEX operating on two 
bands and featuring a larger (120-foot) antenna and higher average 
power for extreme sensitivity. 
An improved system planned for the early 1970s is ALCOR 
(ARPA-Lincoln C-Band Observables Radar). Operating in the SHF 
band, it will provide extremely fine-grain resolution data in both 
range and range-rate for the same type and complex of targets as 
TRADEX and ALTAIR.14 
The trend in future tracking radars seems to be toward some form 
of electronically-steered "agile beam" radar. This may take the form of 
a hybrid between the mechanically-steered dish antenna and the fixed 
phased-array configuration. It is certain that solid-state circuitry will 
play an increasing role in surveillance and tracking systems. 
One of the most promising innovations in tracking is the use of 
laser technology. Theoretica lly, the laser is capable of providing real­
time tracking data more accurately than any other method. 
Until recently most laser tracking systems required an optical reflec­
tor on the target satellite. Now, a continuous- wave, Doppler-type laser 
radar that does not require a cooperative target is under developmen t at 
MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. Many improvements, however, are required 
before a workable laser radar system can be realized. 
In the system under development , the target-reflected laser beam, 
which is shifted in frequency by the moving target, is combined with a 
sample of the laser's output producing a signal at the difference 
frequency of the two mixed beams that is proportional to the range­
rate, p, of the target.1 5 
A serious disadvantage of laser systems is that they only work in 
good weather. 
2.15 GROUND TRACK OF A SATELLITE 
While knowing the orbital elements of a satellite enables you to 
visualize the orbit and its orientation in the IJ K inertial reference 
frame, it is often important to know what the ground track of a 

<<<PAGE 156>>>

Sec. 2015 GROUND TRACK OF A SATELLITE 141 
Figure 2.15-1 Ground trace 
satellite is. One of the most valuable characteristics of an artificial earth 
satellite is its ability to pass over large portions of the earth's surface in 
a relatively short time. As a result it has tremendous potential as an 
instrument for scientific or military surveillan ce. 
2.1 5.1 Ground Track on a Nonrota ting Earth. The orbit of an earth 
satellite always lies in a plane passing through the center of the earth. 
The track of this plane on the surface of a nonrotating spherical earth is 
a great circle. If the earth did not rotate the satellite would retrace the 
same ground track over and over. Figure 2.15-1 shows what the ground 
track would look like on a Mercator projection. 
Notice that the maximum latitude north or south of the equator 
that the satellite passes over is just equal to the inclinatio n, i, of the 
orbit. For a retrograde orbit the most northerly or southerly latitude on 
the ground track is 18cP -i. 
2.15.2 Effect of Launch Site Latitude and Launch Azimuth on 
Orbit Inclination. We can determine the effect of launch site latitude 
and launch azimuth on orbit inclination by studying Figure 2.15-2. 
Suppose a satellite is launched from point C on the earth whose latitude 
and longitude are La and An, respectively with a launch azimuth, {3 • 
The ground track of the resulting orbit crosses the equator at a point CJ... 
at an angle equal to the orbital inclination. The arc CB which forms the 

<<<PAGE 157>>>

142 ORBIT DETERMINATION FROM OBSE RVATION Ch.2 
third side of a spherical triangle is formed by the meridian passing 
through the launch site and subtends the angle Lo at the center of the 
earth. Since we know two angles and the included side of this triangle 
we can solve for the third angle, i: 
o 
cos i = - cIs 900 cos f30 1 
+ sf 900 sin f30 cos Lo 
cos i = sin f30 cos Lo. (2.15·1) 
There is a tremendous amount of interesting information concealed 
in this innocent ·looking equation. For a direct orbit (0 < i <90°) cos i 
must be positive. Since Lo can range between 0° and 900 for launch 
sites in the northern hemisphe re and between 0° and . 90° for launch 
sites in the southern hem isphere, cos Lo must always be positive. A 
direct orbit requires, therefore, that the launch azimuth, f30' be easterly, 
i.e., between 00 and 180°. 
Suppose we now ask "what is the minimum orbital inclination we 
can achieve from a launch site at latitude, Lo?" If i is to be minimized, 
cos i must be maximized which impli es that launch azimuth, f30' should 
be 90°. For a due east launch equation (2.15·1) tells us that the orbital 
inclination will be the minimum possible from a launch site at latitude, 
La and i will be precisely equal to Lo! 
Among other things, this tells us that a satellite cannot be put 
directly into an equatorial orbit (i = 0° ) from a launch site which is not 
on the equator. The Soviet Union is at a particular disadvantage in this 
regard because none of its launch sites is closer than 45° to the equator 
so it cannot launch a satellite whose inclination is less than 45°. If the 
Soviets wish to establish an equatorial orbit it requires a plane change 
of at least 45° after the satellite is established in its initial orbit. This is 
an expensive maneuver as we shall see in the next chapter. 
2.15.3 Effect of Earth Rotation on the Ground Track. The orbital 
plane of a satellite remains fixed in space while the earth turns under 
the orbit. The net effect of earth rotation is to displace the ground 
track westward on each successive revolution of the satellite by the 
number of degrees the earth turns during one orbital period. The result 
is illustrated in Figure 2.15·3. 
Instead of retracing the same ground track over and over a satellite 

<<<PAGE 158>>>

Sec. 2.15 GROUND TRACK OF A SATELLITE 143 
Figure 2.15-2 Effect of launch azimuth and latitude on inclination 
eventually covers a swath around the earth between lati tudes north and 
south of the equator equal to the inclination. A global surveillance 
satellite would have to be in a polar orbit to overfly all of the earth's 
surface. 
If the time required for one complete rotation of the earth on its 
axis (23 hrs 56 min) is an exact multiple of the satellite's period then 
eventually the satellite will ret race exactly the same path over the earth 
as it did on its initial revolution. This is a desirable property for a 
reconnaissance satellite where you wish to have it overfly a specific 
target once each day. It is also desirable in manned spaceflights to 
overfly the primary astronaut recovery areas at least once each day.

CHAPTER 3 
BASIC ORBITAL MANEUVERS 
But if we now imagine bodies to be projected in the 
directions of lines parallel to the horizon from greater 
heights, as of 5,10,)00, 1,000 or more miles, or rather as 
many semidiameters of the earth, those bodies, according 
to their diff erent velocity, and the different force of gravity 
in different heights, will describe arcs either concentric with 
the earth, or variously eccentric, and go on revolving 
through the heavens in those orbits just as the planets do in 
their orbits. 
-Isaac Newton! 
The concept of artificial satellites circling the earth was introduced 
to scientific literature by Sir Isaac Newton in 1686. After that, for the 
next 250 years, the idea seems to have been forgotten. The great 
pioneers of rocketry-Ziolkovsky, Goddard, and Oberth-were the first 
to predict that high performance rockets together with the prinCiple of 
"staging" would make such artificial satellites possible. It is a curious 
fact that these pioneers foresaw and predicted manned satellites but 
none of them could see a use for unmanned earth satellites. Ley2 
suggests that the absence of reliable telemetering techniques in the early 
1930s would explain tills oversight. 
Who was the first to think of an unmanned artificial satellite after 
the concept of a manned space station had been introduced by Hermann 
Oberth in 1923 still remains to be established. It very likely may have 
been Wernher von Braun or one of the others at Peenemunde-the first 
place on earth where a group of people with space-travel inclinations 
was paid to devote all their time, energy and imagination to rocket

research.2 Walter Dornberger in his book V-2 mentions that the 
discussions about future developments at Peenemiinde included the 
rather macabre suggestion that the space-travel pioneers be honored by 
placing their embalmed bodies into glass spheres which would be put 
into orbit around the earth.3 
The earliest plans to actually fire a satellite into earth orbit were 
proposed by von Braun at a meeting of the Space-Flight Committee of 
the American Rocket Society in the Spring of 1954. His plan was to use 
a Redstone rocket with successive clusters of a small solid propellant 
rocket called "Loki" on top. The scheme was endorsed by the Office of 
Naval Research and dubbed "Project Orbiter." Launch date was 
tentatively set for midsummer of 1957. 
However, on 29 July 1955, the White House announced that the 
United States would orbit an artificial earth satellite called "Vanguard" 
as part of its International Geophysical Year Program. 
Project Orbiter, since it contemplated the use of military hardware, 
was not considered appropriate for launching a "strictly scientific" 
satellite and the plan was shelved. 
On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union successfully orbited Sputnik I. 
After several Vanguard failures the von Braun team was at last given its 
chance and put up Explorer I on 1 February 1958. Vanguard I was 
finally launched successfully 1 � months later. 
In this chapter we will describe the methods used to establish earth 
satellites in both low and high altitude orbits and the techniques for 
maneuvering them from one orbit to another. 
3.1 LOW ALTITUDE EARTH ORBITS 
Manned spaceflight, still in its infancy, has largely been confined to 
regions of space very near the surface of the earth. The reason for this is 
neither timidity nor lack of large booster rockets. Rather, the 
environment of near-earth space conspires to limit the altitude of an 
artificial satellite, particularly if it is manned, to a very narrow region 
just above the earth's sensible atmosphere. 
Altitudes below 100 nm are not possible because of atmospheric 
drag and th� Van Allen radiation belts limit manned flights to altitudes 
below about 300 nm. 
3.1.1 Effect of Orbital Altitude on Satellite Lifetimes. The exact 
relationship between orbital altitude and satellite lifetime depends on 
several factors. For circular orbits of a manned satellite about the size

of the Gemini or Apollo spacecraft, Figure 3.1-1 shows the limits 
imposed by drag, radiation and meteorite damage considerations. 
For elliptical orbits the limits are slightly different, but you should 
keep in mind that the perigee altitude cannot be much less than 100 nm 
nor the apogee altitude much greater than 300 nm for the reasons just 
stated. . 
The eccentricity of an elliptical orbit whose perigee altitude is 100 
nm and whose apogee altitude is 300 nm is less than .03! Because it is 
difficult to imagine just how close such an orbit is to the surface of the 
earth, we have drawn one to scale in Figure· 3.1·2. The military 
potential of a low altitude satellite for reconnaissance is obvious from 
this sketch.

directly into a low altitude orbit by having its booster rockets burn

Figure 3.1-3 Direct ascent into a low altitude orbit 
continuously from lift-off to a burnout point somewhere on the desired 
orbit. The injection or burnout point is usually planned to occur at 
perigee with a flight-path angle at burnout of 00. Any deviation from 
the correct burnout speed or flight-path angle could be catastrophic for, 
as you can see from Figure 3.1-2, there is very little clearance between 
the orbit and the surface of the earth. 
It normally takes at least a two-stage booster to inject a two-or 
three-man vehicle into low earth orbit. The vehicle is not allowed to 
coast. between first stage booster separation and second stage ignition. 
The powered flight trajectory looks something like what is shown in 
Figure 3.1-3. The" vehicle rises vertically from the launch pad, 
immediately beginning a roll to the correct azimuth. The pitch 
program-a slow tilting of the vehicle to the desired flight-path 
angle-normally begins about 15 seconds after lift-off and continues 
until the vehicle is traveling horizontally at the desired burnout 
altitude. The final burnout point is usually about 300 nm downrange of 
the launch point. 
The first stage booster falls to the earth several hundred miles 
downrange but the final stage booster, since it has essentially the same 
speed and direction at burnout as the satellite itself, may orbit the earth 
for several revolutions before atmospheric drag causes its orbit to decay 
and it re-enters. The lower ballistic coefficient (weight to area ratio) of 

<<<PAGE 171>>>

the empty booster causes it to be affected more by drag than the 
vehicle itself would be. 
3.1.3 Perturbations of Low Altitude Orbits Due to the Oblate Shape 
of the Earth. The earth is not spherical as we assumed it to be and, 
therefore, its center-of-gravity is not coincident with its center-of-mass. 
If you are very far from the center of the earth the difference is not 
significant, but for low altitude earth orbits the effects are not 
negligible. 
The two principal effects are regression of the line-of-nodes and 
rotation of the line-of-apsides (major axis). Nodal regression is a 
rotation of the plane of the orbit about the earth's axis ofrotation at a 
rate which depends on both orbital inclination and altitude. As a result, 
successive ground traces of direct orbits are displaced westward farther 
than would be the case due to earth rotation alone. 
Figure 3.1-4 Perturbative torque caused by earth's equatorial bulge 
The graVitational effect of an oblate earth can more easily be 
visualized by picturing a spherical earth surrounded by a belt of excess 
matter representing the equatorial bulge. When a satellite is in the 
positions shown in Figure 3.1-4 the net effect of the bulges is to 
produce a slight torque on the satellite about the center of the earth. 
This torque will cause the plane of the orbit to precess just as a 
gyroscope would under a similar torque. The result is that the nodes 
move westward for direct orbits and eastward for retrograde orbits. 
The nodal regression rate is shown in Figure 3.1-5. Note that for low 
altitude orbits of low inclination the rate approaches 90per day . You

should be able to look at Figure 3.1-4 and see why the nodal regression 
is greatest for orbits whose inclination is near 00 or 1800 and goes to 
zero for polar orbits. 
The rotation of the line of apsides is only applicable to eccentric 
orbits. With this perturbation, which also is due to oblateness, the 
major axis of an elliptical trajectory will rotate in the direction of 
motion of the satellite if the orbital inclination is less than 63.40 or 
greater than 116.60, and oppo.site to the direction of motion for 
inclinations between 63.40 and 116.60. The rate at which the major 
axis rotates is a function of both orbit altitude and inclination angle. 
Figure 3.1-6 shows the apsidal rotation rate versus inclination angle for 
a perigee altitude of 100 nl'll and various apogee altitudes. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. A satellite is orbiting the earth in a 500 nm 
circular orbit. The ascending node moves to the west, completing one 
revolution every 90 days. 
a. What is the inclination of the orbit? 
b. It is desired that the ascending node make only one revolution 
every 135 days. Calculate the new orbital inclination required if the

3.2 HIGH ALTITUDE EARTH ORBITS 
Figure 3.1-1 shows that to be safe from radiation a high altitude 
manned satellite would have to be above 5,000 nm altitude. On the 
scale of Figure 3.1-2 this would be 2*-inches from the surface. Of 
course, unmanned satellites can operate safely anywhere above 100 nm 
altitude. 
The reasons for wanting a higher orbit could be to get away from 
atmospheric drag entirely or to be able to see a large part of the earth's 
surface at one time. For communications satellites this latter 
consideration can be all important. As you go to higher orbits the 
period of the satellite increases. If you go high enough the period can 
be made exactly equal to the time it takes the earth to rotate once on 
its axis (23 hr 56 min). This is the so-called "stationary" or 
synchronous satellite. 
3.2.1 The Synchronous Satellite. If the period of a circular direct 
equatorial orbit is exactly 23 hr 56 min it will appear to hover 
motionless over a point on the equator. This, of course, is an illusion 
since the satellite is not at rest in the inertial IJ K frame but only in the 
noninertial topocentric-horizon frame. 
The correct altitude for a synchronous circular orbit is 19,300 nm or 
about 5.6 earth radii above the surface. Such a satellite would be well 
above the dangerous Van Allen radiation and could be manned. 
The great utility of such a satellite for communications is obvious. 
Its usefulness as a reconnaissance vehicle is debatable. It might be able 
to detect missile launchings by their infrared "signatures." High 
resolution photography of the earth's surface would be difficult from 
that altitude, however. 
There is much misunderstanding even among otherwise well­
informed persons concerning the . ground trace of a synchronous 
satellite. Many think it possible to "hang" a synchronous satellite over 
any point on the earth-Red China, for example. This is, unfortunately, 
not the case. The satellite can only appear to be motionless over a point 
on the equator. If the synchronous circular orbit is inclined to the 
equator its ground trace will be a "figure-eight" curve which carries it 
north and south approximately along a meridian. Figure 3.2-1 shows 
why. 
3.2.2 Launching a High Altitude Satellite-The Ascent Ellipse. 
Launching a high altitude satellite is a two-step operation requiring two 
burnouts separated by a coasting phase. The first stage booster climbs

an "ascent ellipse") which has its apogee at the altitude of the desired 
orbit. At apogee of the ascent ellipse, the second stage booster engines 
are fired to increase the speed of the satellite and establish it in its final 
orbit. 
This burn-coast-burn technique is normally used any time the 
altitude of the orbit injection point exceeds 150 nm .

3.3 IN-PLANE ORBIT CHANGE S 
Due to small errors in burnout altitude, speed, and flight-path angle, 
the exact orbit desired may not be achieved. Usually this is not serious, 
but, if a rendezvous is contemplated or if, for some other reason, a very 
precise orbit is required, it may be necessary to make small corrections 
in the orbit. This may be done by applying small speed changes or fslis, 
as they are called, at appropriate points in the orbit. In the next two 
sections we shall consider both small in-plane corrections to an orbit 
and large changes from one circular orbit to a new one of different size. . 
3.3.1 Adjustment of Perigee and Apogee Height. In Chapter 1 we 
derived the following energy relationship which is valid for all orbits: 
v2 
&=-2 !!:.=_ fJ. 
r 2a . 
If we solve for'; we get (3.3-1) 
(3.3-2) 
Suppose we decide to change the speed, v, at a point in an orbit 
leaving r unchanged. What effect would this f:N have on the semi-major 
axis, a? We can find out by taking the differential of both sides of 
equation (3.3-2) considering r as fixed and /:;.v in the velocity direction. 
or fJ. 2vdv = -da a2 
2a2 da = -vdv. 
fJ. (3.3-3) 
(3.3-4) 
For an infinitesimally small change in speed, dv, we get a change in 

<<<PAGE 178>>>

Sec. 3.3 IN-PLANE ORBIT CHANGES 163 
semi-major axis, da, of the orbit given by equation (3.3-4). Since the 
major axis is 2a, the length of the orbit changes by twice this amount or 2da. 
But suppose we make the speed change at perigee? The resulting 
change in major axis will actually be a change in the height of apogee. 
Similarly, a 6.V applied at apogee will result in a change in perigee 
height. We can specialize the general relationship shown by equation 
(3.3-4) for small but finite 6.v's applied at perigee and apogee as 
4 a2 6.h � --v 6.V a Jl. P P 
(3.3-5) 
This method of evaluating a small change in one of the orbital 
elements as a result of a small change in some other variable is 
illustrative of one of the techniques used in perturbation theory. In 
technical terms what we have just done is called "variation of 
parameters." 
3.3.2 The Hohmann Transfer. Transfer between two circular 
coplanar orbits is one of the most useful maneuvers we have. It 
represents an alternate method of establishing a satellite in a high 
altitude orbit. For example, we could first make a direct ascent to a low 
altitude "parking orbit" and then transfer to a higher circular orbit by 
means of an elliptical transfer orbit which is just tangent to both of the 
circular orbits. 
The least speed change (6.v) required for a transfer between two 
circular orbits is achieved by using such a doubly-tangent transfer 
ellipse. The first recognition of this principle was by Hohmann in 1925 
and such orbits are, therefore, called Hohmann transfer orbits. 5 
Consider the two circular orbits shown in Figure 3.3-1. Suppose we 
want to travel from the small orbit, whose radius is rl, to the large 
orbit, whose radius is r2,along the transfer ellipse. 
We call the speed at point 1 on the transfer ellipse vl. Since 
we know rl, we could compute vl if we knew the energy of

(3.3-7) 
We can now write the energy equation for point 1 of the elliptical 
orbit and solve it for Vi: 
(3.3-8) 
Since our satellite already has circular speed at point 1 of the small 
orbit, its speed is 

<<<PAGE 180>>>

Sec. 3.3 IN-PLAN E ORBIT CHANGES 165 
(3.3-9) 
To make our satellite go from the small circular orbit to the transfer 
ellipse we need to increase its speed from Vcs, to VI' So, I 6V = V • V I I CSl • (3.3-10) 
The speed change required to transfer from the ellipse to the large 
circle at point 2 can be computed in a similar fashion. 
Although , in our example, we went from a smaller orbit to a larger 
one, the same principle s may be applied to a transfer in the opposite 
direction. The only difference would be that two speed decreases would 
be required instead of two speed increases. 
The time-of-flight for a Hohmann transfer is obviously just half the 
period of the transfer orbit. Since lP t = 21TV<it3 /J-L and we know <it, 
(3.3-11) 
While the Hohmann transfer is the most economical from the 
standpoint of /::'v required, it also takes longer than any other possible 
transfer orbit between the same two circular orbits. The other possible 
transfer orbits between coplanar circular orbits are discussed in the next 
section. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM . A communic ations satellite is in a circular 
orbit of radius 2 DU. Find the minimum /::,V required to double the 
altitude of the satellite.

3.3.3 General Coplanar Transfer Between Circular Orbits. Transfer 
between circular coplanar orbits merely requires that the transfer orbit 
intersect or at least be tangent to both of the circular orbits. Figure 
3.3-2 shows transfer orbits which are both possible and impossible. 
It is obvious from Figure 3.3-2 that the periapsis radius of the 
transfer orbit must be equal to or less than the radius of the inner orbit 
and the apoapsis radius must be equal to or exceed the radius of the 
outer orbit if the transfer orbit is to touch both circular orbits. We can 
express this condition mathematically as 
p r=--�r p 1 + e 1 
p r=--�r a 1 _ e 2 (3.3-12) 
(3.3-13)

Figure 3.3-2 Transfer orbit must intersect both circular orbits 
where p and e are the parameter and eccentricity of the transfer orbit 
and where r 1 and r 2 are the radii of the inner and outer circular orbits, 
respectively. 
Orbits that satisfy both of these equations will intersect or at least 
be tangent to both circular orbits. We can plot these two equations (See 
Figure 3.3-3) and interpret them graphically. To satisfy both 
conditions, p and e of the transfer orbit must specify a point which lies 
in the shaded area. Values of (p, e) which fall on the limit lines 
correspond to orbits that are just tangent to one or the other of the

Now, since we know two sides and the included angle of the vector 
triangle shown in Figure 3.3-4, we can use the law of cosines to solve 
for the third side, b.V.

The speed change required at point 2 can be computed in a similar 
fashion. 
Since the Hohmann transfer is just a special case of the problem 
illustrated above, it is not surprising that equation (3.3-17) reduces to 
equation (3.3-10) when the flight-path angle, ¢l' is zero. 
3.4 OUT-OF-PLANE ORBIT CHANGE S 
A velocity change, b.V, which lies in the plane of the orbit can change 
its size or shape, or it can rotate the line of apsides. To change the 
orientation of the orbital plane in space requires a b.V component 
perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. 
3.4.1 Simple Plane Change. If, after applying a finite b.V, the speed 
and flight-path angle of the satellite are unchanged, then only the plane 
of the orbit has been altered. This is called a simple plane change. 
An example of a simple plane change would be changing an inclined 
orbit to an equatorial orbit as shown in Figure 3.4-1. The plane of the 
orbit has been changed through an angle, e. The initial velocity and 
final velocity are identical in magnitude and, together with the b.V 
required, form an isosceles vector triangle. We can solve for the 
magnitude of b.V using the law of cosines, assuming that we know v and 
e. Or, more simply, we can divide the isosceles triangle into two right 
triangles, as shown at the right of Figure 3.4-1, and obtain directly 
for circular orbits. (3.4-1) 
If the object of the plane change is to "equatorialize" an 
orbit, the b.V must be applied at one of the nodes (where the 

<<<PAGE 185>>>

170 BASIC ORBITAL MANEUVERS Ch.3 
Figure 3.4-1 Simple plane change through an angle e 
satellite passes through the equatorial plane). 
Large plane changes are prohibitively expensive in terms of the 
velocity change required. A plane change of 600, for example , makes b.V 
equal to v! The Soviet Union must pay this high price if it wants 
equatorial satellites. Since it has no launch sites south of latitude 450 
N, it cannot launch a satellite whose inclination is less than 450. 
Therefore, a turn of at least 450 must be made at the equator if the 
satellite is to be equatorialized. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. It is desired to transfer supplies from a 0.1 
DU circular parking orbit around the earth to a space station in a 4 DU 
coplanar circular orbit. The transfer will be accomplished via an 
elliptical orbit tangent to the lower orbit and crossing the high orbit at 
the end of the minor axis of the transfer orbit. 
a. Determine the total b.vrequired to accomplish the mission. 
b. If the space station orbit is inclined at an angle of 10° to the 
low parking orbit, calculate the additional b.V required for the simple 
plane change necessary to accomplish the transfer. Assume the plane 
change is performed after you have established the shuttle vehicle in a 4 
DU circular orbit. .

AS A FUNCTION OF TIME 
... the determination of the true movement of the 
planets, including the earth ... This was Kepler's first great 
problem. The second problem lay in the question: What are 
the mathematical laws controlling these movements? 
Clearly, the solution of the second problem, if it were 
possible for the human spirit to accomplish it, presupposed 
the solution of the first. For one must know an event 
before one can testa theory related to this event.

4.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
The year Tycho Brahe died (I 60 1) Johannes Kepler, who had 
worked with Tycho in the 18 months preceding his death, was 
appointed as Imperial Mathematici an to the Court of Emperor Rudolph 
II. Recognizing the goldmine of information locked up in Tycho's 
painstaking observations, Kepler packed them up and moved them to 
Prague with him. In a letter to one of his English admirers he calmly 
reported: 
"I confess that when Tycho died, I quickly took 
advantage of the absence, or lack of circumspection, of the 
heirs, by taking the observations under my care, or perhaps 
usurping them ... ,,2 
177

Kepler stayed in Prague from 1601 to 1612. It was the most fruitful 
period of his life and saw the publication of Astronomia Nova in 1609 
in which he announced his first two laws of planetary motion. The 
manner in which Kepler arrived at these two laws is fascinating and can 
be told only because in New Astronomy Kepler leads his reader into 
every blind alley, detour, trap or pitfall that he himself encountered. 
"What matters to me," Kepler points out in his Preface, "is 
not merely to impart to the reader what I have to say, but 
above all to convey to him the reasons, subterfuges, and lucky 
hazards which led me to my discoveries. When Christopher 
Columbus, Magelhaen and the Portuguese relate how they 
went astray on their journeys, we not only forgive them, but 
would regret to miss their narration because without it the 
whole grand entertainment would be lost.,,2 
Kepler selected Tycho's observations of Mars and tried to reconcile 
them with some simple geometrical theory of motion. He began by mak­
ing three revolutionary assumptions: (a) that the orbit was a circle with 
the sun slightly off-center, (b) that the orbital motion took place in a 
plane which was fixed in space, and (c) that Mars did not necessarily 
move with uniform velocity along this circle. Thus, Kepler immediately 
cleared away a vast amount of rubbish that had obstructed progress 
since Ptolemy. 
Kepler's first task was to determine the radius of the circle and the 
aphelion

Sec 4.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 179 
direction of the axis connecting perihelion and aphelion. At the very 
beginning of a whole chapter of excruciating trial-and-error calculations, 
Kepler absentmindedly put down three erroneous figures for three vital 
longitudes of Mars, never noticing his error. His results, however, were 
nearly correct because of several mistakes of simple arithmetic 
committed later in the chapter which happened very nearly to cancel 
out his earlier errors. 
At the end he seemed to have achieved his goal of representing 
within 2 arc-minutes the position of Mars at all 10 oppositions recorded 
by Tycho. But then without a word of transition, in the next two 
chapters Kepler explains, .almost with masochistic delight, how two 
other observations from Tycho's collection did not lit; there was a 
discrepancy of 8 minutes of arc. Others might have shrugged off this 
minor disparity between fact and hypothesis. It is to Kepler's 
everlasting credit that he made it the basis for a complete reformation 
of astronomy. He decided that the sacred concept of circular motion 
had to go. 
Before Kepler could determine the true shape of Mars' orbit, 
without benefit of any preconceived notions, he had to determine 
precisely the earth's motion around the sun. For this purpose he 
designed a highly original method and when he had finished his 
computations he was ecstatic. His results showed that the earth did not 
move with uniform speed, but faster or slower according to its distance 
from the sun. Moreover, at the extremums of the orbit (perihelion and 
aphelion) the earth's velocity proved to be inversely proportional to 
distance. 
At this point Kepler could contain himself no longer and becomes 
airborne, as it were, with the warning: "Ye physicists, prick your ears, 
for now we are going to invade your territory." He was convinced that 
there was "a force in the sun" which moved the planets. What could be 
more beautifully simple than that the force should vary inversely with 
distance? He had proved the inverse ratio of speed to distance for only 
two points in the orbit, perihelion and aphelion, yet he made the 
patently incorrect generalization that this "law" held true for the entire 
orbit. This was the first of the critical mistakes that would cancel itself 
out "as if by a miracle" and lead him by faulty reasoning to the correct 
result. 
Forgetting his earlier resolve to abandon circular motion he 
reasoned, again incorrectly, that, since speed was inversely proportional 
to distance, the line joining the sun (which was off-center in the circle) 
and the planet swept out equal areas in the orbit in equal times. 

<<<PAGE 195>>>

180 POSITION AND VELOCITY -A FUNCTION Of: TIME Ch. 4 
Figure 4.1-2 Kepler's law of equal areas 
This was his famous Second Law-discovered before the First-a law 
of amazing simplicity , arrived at by a series of faulty steps which he 
himself later recognized with the observation: "But these two errors-it 
is like a miracle-cancel out in the most precise manner, as I shall prove 
further down.,,2 
The correct result is even more miraculous than Kepler realized since 
his explanation of why the errors cancelled was also erroneous! 
Kepler now turned again to. the problem of replacing the circle with 
another geometric shape; he settled on the oval. But a very special oval: 
it had the shape of an egg, with the narrow end at the perihelion and 
the broad end at aphelion. As Koestler2 observed: "No philosopher had 
laid such a monstrous egg before." 
Finally, a kind of snowblindness seemed to descend upon him: he 
held the solution in his hands but was unable to see it. On 4 July 1603 
he wrote a friend that he was unable to solve the problem of computing 
the area of his oval; but "if only the shape were a perfect ellipse all the 
answers could be found in Archimedes' and Apollonius' work.,,2 
Finally, after struggling with his egg for more than a year he stumbled 
onto the secret of the Martian orbit. He was able to express the distance 
from the sun by a simple mathematical formula: but he did not 
recognize that this formula specifically defined the orbit as an ellipse. 
Any student of analytical geometry today would have recognized it 
immediately; but analytical geometry came after Kepler. He had 

<<<PAGE 196>>>

Sec 4.2 TIME-OF-FLIGHT -ECCENTRIC ANOMALY 181 
reached his goal, but he did not realize that he had reached it! 
He tried to construct the curve represented by his equation, but he 
did not know how, made a mistake in geometry, and ended up with a 
"chubby-faced" orbit. The climax to this comedy of errors. came when, 
in a moment of despair, Kepler threw out his equation (which denoted 
an ellipse) because he wanted to try an entirely new hypothesis: to wit·, 
an elliptic orbit! When the orbit fit and he realized what had happened, 
he frankly confessed: 
"Why should I mince my words? The truth of Nature, 
which I had rejected .and chased away, returned by stealth 
through the backdoor, disguising itself to be accepted. That 
is to say, I laid [the original equation] aside and fell back 
on ellipses, believing that this was a quite different . hypothesis, whereas the two ... are one and the same ... I 
thought and searched, until I went nearly mad, fora reason 
why the planet preferred an elliptical orbit [to. mine] 
... Ah, what a foolish bird I have been!,,2 
In the end, Kepler was able to write an empirical expression for th.e 
time-of-flight of a planet from one point in its 'orbit . to 
another-although he still did not know the true reason wb,y it should 
move in an orbit at all. In this chapter we will,witl1 thepenefit of 
hindsight and concepts introduced by Newton, derive the. Kepler 
time-of-flight equation in much the same way that Kepler did. We will 
then turn our attention to the solution of what has come to be known 
as "the Kepler problem"-pre dicting the future position and velocity of 
an orbiting object as a function of some known initial position. and 
velocity and the time-of-flight. In doing this we will introduce one of 
the most recent advances in the field of orbital mechartics-a universal 
formulation of the time-of-flight relationships valid for �U coni� orbits.

. . .:. Many of the concepts introduced by Kepler, along w�thth� naples 
he used to describe them, have persisted to this day; You: are ,!iready 
familiar with the term "true anomaly" used to describe the angle from 
periapsis to the orbiting object measured in the directiop dmotion. In 
this section we will encounter a new term called "eccentric apotIialy'.: 
which was introduced by Kepler in connection with ellipticalmbits. 
Although he was not aware that parabolic and hyperbolic orbits 

<<<PAGE 197>>>

182 POSITION AND VELOCITY - A FUNCTION OF TIME Ch.4 
existed, the concept can be extended to these orbits also as we shall see. 
It is possible to derive time-of-flight equations analytically , using 
only the dynamical equation of motion and integral calculus. We will 
pursue a lengthier, but more motivated, derivation in which the 
eccentric anomaly arises quite naturally in the course of the geometrical 
arguments. This derivation is presented more for its historical value 
than for actual use. The universal variable approach is strongly 
recommended as the best method for general use. 
4.2.1 Time-of-Flight on the Elliptical Orbit. We have already seen 
that in one orbital period the radius vector sweeps out an area equal to 
the total area of an ellipse, i.e., 7Tab. In going part way around an orbit, 
say from periapsis to some general point, P, where the true anomaly is 
v, the radius vector sweeps out the shaded area, AI' in Figure 4.2-l. 
Because area is swept out at a constant rate in an orbit (Kepler's Second 
Law) we can say that

A circle of radius a has been circumscri bed about the ellipse. A

the eccentric anomaly. 
Before proceeding further we must derive a simple relationship 
between the ellipse and its auxiliary circle. From analytical geometry, 
the equations of the curves in cartesian coordinates are:

This simple relationship between the v-ordinates of the two curves 
will playa key role in subsequent area and length comparisons. 
, From Figure 4�2-2 we note that the area swept out by the radius 
vect�r is ;�rea PSV minus the dotted area, A2. 
: Al = Area PSV -A2 . 
Since A2 is the area of a triangle whose base is ae -a oos E and whose 
altitude is b/a (a sin E), we can write 
A2 = a� (e sin E -cos E sin E) . (4.2-3) 
Area'PSV is the area under the ellipse; it is bounded by the dotted 
line and the major axis. Area QSV is the corresponding area under the 
auxiliary circle. It Tollows directly from equation (4.2-2) that 
Area PSV = � (Area QSV)

<<<PAGE 200>>>

Sec 4.2 TIME-OF-FLIGHT -ECCENTR IC ANOMAL Y 185 
The Area OSV is just the area of the sector QOV , which is 1/2 a2 E 
(where E is in radians), minus the triangle, whose base is (a CDS E), and 
whose altitude is (a sin E). Hence 
Area PSV = ab (E � cos E sin E). 2 
Substituting into the expression for area Ai yields 
Ai = a� (E - e sin E) . 
Finally, substituting into equation (4.2-1) and expressing the period as 
21T�' ,we get 
It -T =4 (E -e sin E) I (4.2-4) 
Kepler introduced the definition 
M = E -e sin E (4.2-5) 
where M is called the "mean anomaly." If we also use the definition 
where n is called the "mean motion," then the mean anomaly may be 
written: 
M = n (t -T) = E -e sin E (4.2-6) 
which is often referred to as Kepler's equation. 
Obviously , in order to use equation (4.2-4), we must be able to 
relate the eccentric anomaly, E, to its correspon ding true anomaly, v. 
From Figure 4.2-2, 
cos E = ae + r cos v a 
Since r = a(1 -e2) equation (4.2-7) reduces to + e cos v 
.cos E = e + cos v 
1 + e cos v (4.2-7) 
(4.2-8) 

<<<PAGE 201>>>

186 POSITION AND VELOCITY -A FUNCTION OF TIME Ch. 4 
Eccentric anomaly may be determined from equation (4.2-8). The 
correct quadrant for E is obtained by noting that v and E are always in 
the same half-plane; when vis between o and n, so is E. 
Figure 4.2-4 Time-of-flight between arbitrary points 
Suppose we want to find the time-of-flight between a point defined 
by Vo and some general point defmed by v when the initial point is not 
periapsis. Provided the object does not pass through periapsis enroute 
from Vo to V (Figure 4.2-4 left), we can say that 
t - to = (t -T) -(to -T). 
If the object does pass through periapsis (which is the case whenever 
Vo is greater than v) then, from Figure 4.2-4 right, 
t - to = lP + (t -T) -(to -To) . 
In general we can say that 
t -to = 4-[2kn + (E - e Sin E) 
-(Eo -e sin Eo)] (4.2-9) 
where k is the number of times the object passes through periapsis 
enroute from Vo to v. 
At this point it is instructive to note that this same result can be 
llerived analytical ly. In this case the eocentric anomaly appears as a

4.2.3 Loss of Numerical Accuracy for Near-Parabolic Orbits. The 
Kepler time-of-flight equations suffer from a severe loss in 
computatio nal accuracy near e = 1. The nature of the difficulty can 
best be illustrated by a numerical example: 
Suppose we want to compute the time-of-flight from periapsis to a 
point where V = fiP on an elliptical orbit with a = 100 DU and e = 
0.999. The first step is to compute the eccentric anomaly. From 
equation (4.2-8), 
cos E = .999 + .5 = .99967 1 + .999(.5) 
Therefore E = 0.02559, sin E = 0.02560 and (e sin E) = 0.02557. 
Substituting these values into equation (4.2-4), 
t -T =j 1003 (.02559 - .02557)

= 1000 (.00002) = .02 TU 

<<<PAGE 206>>>

Sec 4.3 UNIVERSAL FORMULATION -TIME-OF-FLIGHT 191 
There is a loss of significant digits in computing E from cos E when 
E is near zero. There is a further loss in subtracting two nearly equal 
numbers in the last step. As a result, the answer is totally unreliable. 
This loss of computational accuracy near e = 1 and the inconven­
ience of having a different equation for each type of conic orbit will be 
our principal motivation for developing a universal formulation for 
time-of-flight in section 4.3. 
4.3 A UNIVERSAL FORMULATION FOR TIME-OF-FL IGHT 
The classical formulations for time-of-flight involving the eccentric 
anomalies, E or F, don't work very well for near-parabolic orbits. We 
have already seen the loss of numerical accuracy that can occur near e = 1 in the Kepler equation. Also, solving for E or F when a, e, /J 0 and t -to are given is difficult when e is nearly 1 because the tria1-and-error 
solutions converge too slowly or not at all. Both of these defects are 
overcome in a reformulation of the time-of-flight equations made pos­
sible by the introduction of a new auxiliary variable different from the 
eccentric anomaly. Furthermo re, the introduction of this new auxiliary 
variable allows us to develop a single time-of-flight equation valid for all 
conic orbits. 
The change of variable is known as the "Sundrnan transformation" 
and was first proposed in 1912.6 Only recently, however, has it been 
used to develop a unified time-of-flight equation. Goodyear 7, 
Lemmon8, Herrick9, Stumpff 1 0 , Sperlingll and Battin 3 have all pre­
sented formulae for computation of time-of-flight via "generalized" or 
"universal" variables. The original derivation presented below was sug­
gested by Bate12 and partially makes use of notation introduced by 
Battin.

and energy are related to the geometrical parameters p and a by the 
familiar equations: 
8. = Y2V2 -I::!:. =:1:!:.... . 
r 2a 
If we resolve v into its radial component, r, and its transverse com­
ponent, rv, the energy equation can be written as

At this point we have developed equations for both rand t in terms 
of x. The constant of integration, co' has not been evaluated yet. Appli­
cation of these equations will now be made to a specific problem type. 
4.4 THE PREDICTION PROBLEM 
With the Kepler time-of-flight equations you can easily solve for the 
time-of-flight, t -to' if you are given a, e, Vo and v. The inverse problem 
of finding v when you are given a, e, Vo and t -to is not so simple, as we 
shall see. Small4, in An Account of the Astronomical Discoveries of 
Kepler, relates: "This problem has, ever since the time of Kepler, con­
tinued to exercise the ingenuity of the ablest geometers; but no solu­
tion of it which is rigorously accurate has been obtained. Nor is there 
much reason to hope that the difficulty will ever be overcome ... " This 
problem classically involves the solution of Kepler's Equation and is 
often referred to as Kepler's problem. 
4.4.1 Development of the Universal Variable Formulation. The pre­
diction problem can be stated as (see Figure 4.4-1):

4.4.2 Solving for x When Time is Known. An intermediate step to 
fmding the radius and velocity vectors at a future time is to find x when 
time is known. From ro va and the energy equation you can obtain the 
semi-major axis, a. But now we have a problem; since equation (4.4-12) 
is transcende ntal in x, we cannot get it by itself on the left of the equal 
sign. Therefore, a trial-and-error solution is indicated. 
Fortunately, the t vs x curve is well-behaved and a Ne:wton iteration 
technique may be used successfully to solve for X when time-of·flight is 
given. If we let to = 0 and choose a trial value for x-call it xn' then 
. 'Ii t = fO·VO x2C + (1 -ro) x3S + r x (4.4-14) vt" n vfil nan a n 
where tn is the time-of-flight correspon ding to the given fa, va' a and 
the trial value of x. Equation (4.4-7) has been used to eliminate z. In 
one sense, C and S should have a subscript of n also because they are 
functions of the guess of xn.

198 POSITION AND VELOCITY - A FUNCTION OF TIME Ch. 4 
A better approximation is then obtained from the Newton iteration 
algorithm 
xn+1 = xn + dt/dx I x=xn (4.4-15) 
where t is the given time-of-flight, and where dt I dxlx = x is the slope 
of the t vs x curve at the trial point, xn. n 
An analytical expression for the slope may be obtained directly from 
the definition of xin equation (4.3-2). 
dt _ 1 _ r 
dx -x -.fii (4.4-16) 
Note that the slope of the t vs x curve is directly proportional to r; it 
will be minimum at periapsis and maximum where r is maximum. Some 
typical plots of t vs x are illustrated in Figure 4.4-2. Substituting for r 
in equation (4.4-16) yields 
VJIQ.1= x2C + fO' Vo x (1 -zS) + r (1-zC). (4.4-17) dx VIi 0 
When the difference between t and tn becomes negligible, the iteration 
may be terminated. 
With x known, we must then calculate the corresponding f and v. To 
do this we will now develop what is called the f and 9 expressions in 
terms of x and z. 
4.4.3 The f and 9 Expressio ns. Knowing x we now wish to calculate 
the f and v in terms of f 0' v 0 and x. In determining this relationship we 
will make use of a fundamental theorem concerning coplanar vectors: If 
A, Band C are coplanar vectors, and Aand Bare not colinear, it is pos­
sible to express Cas a linear combination of Aand B. 
Since Keplerian motion is confined to a plane, the four vectors fO' 
V 0' r and vare all coplanar. Thus 
(4.4-18) 
Differentiating this expression gives 
(4.4-19) 

<<<PAGE 214>>>

Sec 4.4 THE PREDICTiON PROBLEM 199 
where f, g, t and 9 are time dependent scalar quantities. The main pur­
pose of this section will be to determine expressions for these scalars in 
terms of the universal variable, x. 
First, however, we will derive an interesting relationship between f, 
g, f and g. Crossing equation (4.4-18) into equation (4.4-19) gives 
Equating the scalar components of h on both sides of the equation 
yields 
h r--= -fg---tg ....... , (4.4-20) 
This equation shows that f, g, f and 9 are not independent; if you 
know any three you can determine the fourth from this useful identity. 
We will now develop the f and 9 expressions in terms of perifocal co­
ordinates. We can isolate the scalar, f, in equation (4.4-18) by crossing 
the equation into vo: 
Since r = Xw p + Yw Q and Vo = Xw p + Yw Q, the left side of the

We can isolate 9 in a similar manner by crossing ro into equation 
(4.4-18): 
To obtain f and 9 we only need to differentiate the expressions for f

cross equation (4.4-19) into 'vo to get f):

Sec 4.5 UNIVERSAL VARIABLE FORMULATION 203 
In computati on, note that equation (4.4-20) can be used as a check on 
the accuracy of the f and 9 expressions. Also, in any of the equations 
where z appears, its definition, x2 la, can be used. Note also that if to 
were not zero, the expression (t -tJ would replace t. 
4.4.4 Algorithm for Solution of the Kepler Problem. 
1. From ro and Vo determine r 0 and a. 
2. Given t -to (usually to is assumed to be zero), solve the universal 
time-of-flight equation for x using a Newton iteration scheme. 
3. Evaluate f and 9 from equations (4.4-31) and (4.4-34); then 
compute rand r from equation (4.4-18). 
4. Evaluate f and 9 (rom equations (4.4-35) and (4.4-36); then 
compute v from equation (4.4-19). 
The advantages of this method over other methods are that only one 
set of equations works for all conic orbits and accuracy and 
convergence for nearly parabolic orbits is better. 
4.5 IMPLEMENTING THE UNIVERSAL VARIABLE FORMULATION 
In this section several aspects of the universal variable formulation 
will be presented which will increase your understanding and facilitate 
its computer implementation. 
4.5.1 The Physical Significance of x and z. Up to now we have 
developed universally valid expressions for rand t -to in terms of the 
auxiliary variables X and z; but we have not said what x and z represent. 
Obviously , if we are going to use equation (4.4-12) above we must 
know how x and z are related to the physical parameters of the orbit. 
Let's compare the expression for r in terms of x with the 
correspond ing expression for r in terms of eccentric anomaly: 
r = a (1 + e si n x + Co ) 
Va 
r = a (1 -e cos E). (4.3-4)

We can conclude that

so E -7r X + Co --+ --� 2ya (4.5-2) 
If we compare equations (4.3-4) and (4.5·1) at time to when x = 0, 
r = r 0' and E = Eo' we get 
Eo = !r. + Co (4.5-3) 2ya 
Subtracting equation (4.5-3) from (4.5-2) yields I X = Va IE - Eol. I (4.5-4) 
Using the identity F -iE, we can conclude that I ·x = V'ii IF - F 01 I (4.5-5) 
whenever a is negative. 
To determine what x represents on the parabolic orbit let's look at 
the general expression for r in terms of x: 
r = X2C + fO-VO (1 S) (1 C) VIi X -Z + ro -z _. 
F or the parabolic orbit z = ° and C = 112, since a = 00 , so 
r = 1 x2 + fO-VO X + 2 y'Ti ro -(4.4-13) 
We will show later in equation (4.6-6) that f • V 0 = Vii Do and in 
equation (4.6-5) that r = 1/2 (p + D2) and r 0 = �/2 (p + �), therefore 
l(p + D2) = 1 x2 + D x + l(p + D2) 
2 2 0 2 0 
If we solve this quadratic for x, we get 
I x= D-Do.1 (4.5-6) 
Which is valid for parabolic orbits. 
Obviously x is related to the change in eccentric anomaly that occurs 
between fO and f. Since z = x2 la, 
(4.5-7)

when z is positive. If z is negative it can only mean that E and Eo are 
imaginary, so I -z = IF -Fa)'·1 (4.5-8) 
When z is zero, either a is infinite or the change in eccentric anomaly 
is zero. 
Figure 4.5-1 Change in true anomaly and eccentric 
anomaly during time t -to 
4.5.2 Some Notes on the Compute r Solution of the Kepler Problem. 
A word of caution is in order concerning the use of the universal 
time-of-flight equation for solving the Kepler problem. In computing 
the semi-major axis, a, from TO and Vo and the energy equation we get 
If the orbit is parabolic the denominator of this expression is zero 
and an error finish would result if the computation is performed on a 
digital computer. Therefore, the reciprocal of a should be computed 
and stored instead: 
(4.5-9) 

<<<PAGE 221>>>

206 POSITION AND VELOCITY -A FUNCTION OF TIME Ch. 4 
All equations should then be modified by replacing 1/a, wherever it 
occurs, with £X. 
The number of iterations required to compute X to any desired 
degree of accuracy depends mainly on the initial trial value of X; if the 
initial estimate of X is close to the correct value, convergence will be 
extremely rapid. 
In the case of elliptical orbits, where the given time·of-flight exceeds 
one orbital period, t can obviously be reduced to less than the period 
and the same r and v will result. Furtherm ore, since X = foE, 
X = ¥ after one orbital pedod and we can make the approximation

where lP is the period. Solving for X and letting lP =2n...ji11;, we get I X � yp.(t a-to). I (4.5-10) 
for elliptical orbits. Use this for a first guess. 
If the orbit is hyperbolic and the change in eccentric anomaly, .6F, is 
large, then Z will be a large negative number. When z is negative the C 
function may be evaluated from 
C = 1 - cosh ,5 z . 
But coshyCz = (eyCz + e -yCz )/2 and ifyCzis a large positive number, 
eFz will be large compared to 1 or e -...;:z, so

Sec 4.5 UNIVERSAL VARIABLE FORMU LATION 207 
The ± sign can be resolved easily since we know (section 4.5.3) that 
the S function is positive for all values of z. Therefore, if X is positive 
we should take the + sign and if X is negative we should take the -sign 
in the above expression. Anytime t -to is positive, X will be positive and 
vice versa, so .

4.6 CLASSICAL FORMULATIONS OF THE KEPLER PROBLE M 
In the interest of relating to the historical development of the 
solution of the Kepler problem we will briefly summarize the solution 
using the various eccentric anomalies. But first some useful identities 
will be presented. 
4.6.1 Some Useful Identities Involving D, E and F. We have 
developed time-of-flight equations for the parabola, ellipse and 
hyperbola which involve the auxiliary variables D, E and F. You have 
already seen how these eccentric anomalies relate to the true anomaly, 
v. Now let's look at the relationship between these auxiliary variables 
and some other physical parameters of the orbit. 
Taking each of the eccentric anomalie s in tum, we will derive 
expressions for xw; y wand r in terms of D, E or F. Then we will relate 
the eccentric anomalie s to the dot product r • v. Finally, we will 
examine the very interest ing and fundamenta l relationship between E 
and F. 
In order to simplify Barker's equation (4.2-17), we introduced the 
parabolic eccentric anomaly, D, as 
D = v'P tan � . 
2 
From Figure 4.6-1 we can see that 
Xw = r cos v . 
But, for the parabola, since e = 1, 
r = _---.JPt::....._ 
+ cos V ' 
P cos v 1 + cos v (4.6-1) 
(4.6.2)

Now substitute cos v = cos2 2-Si� 2 2 in the numerator of equation 
(4.6-2) and substitute cos v = 2 cos2 -- 1 in the denominator: 
x = Q (1 -tan2 �) . w 2 2 2 
If we substitute from equation (4.6-1), the expression for Xw 
reduces to 
The expression for ywis much simpler: 
y w = r sin v = p sin v = p tan v 1 + cos v 2 
r---------------, (4.6-3) 
(4.6-4) 
Since Xw and yware the rectangular components of the vector r in 
the perifocal coordinate system, 
r2 = x2 + y2 W W 
r = 1 (p + D2).

214 POSITION AND VElOCITY -A FUNCTION OF TIME Ch. 4 
Now let's fmd an expression for the dot product, r • v. Using r • r = rr, and equation (2.5-2) and setting e = 1 in this equation and 
substituting for r from the polar equation of a parabola yields 
r • v = P .J7!-sin v = ffp tan v 1 + cos v p, 2' 
If we now substitute from equation (4.6-1), we get 
which is useful for evaluating D when r and v are known. (4.6-6) 
For the eccentric anomaly, in Figure 4.6-2 we have drawn an ellipse 
with its auxiliary circle in the perifocal coordinate system. The origin of 
the perifocal system is at the focus of the ellipse and the distance 
between the focus and the center (0) is just c = ae as shown.

Sec 4.6 THE KEPLER PROBLEM 215 
From Figure 4.6-2, we see that 
Xw = a cos E -ae 
or 1 X w = a (cos E -e) '1 (4.6-7) 
From geometry and the relationship between the y w-ordinates of 
the ellipse and circle, we get 
y w = Q. (a sin E) -a 
But, since b2 = a2 -c3 for the ellipse and C = ae, 
I y w = aJ1 -e2 sin E. I 
Just as we did for the parabola, we can say that 
Substituting from equations (4.6-7) and (4.6-,8) and simplifying, we 
obtain 
----------------------� I r = a (1 -e cos E). (4.6-9) 
If we solve this equation for e illS E we get another useful 
expression: I e COS E = 1 -�. (4.6-10) 
We will find it convenient to have an expression for e sin E also. To 
get it we need to differentiate equation (4.6-9) 
r = (ae sin E)E . 
. 
To find E we could differentiate the Kepler time-of-flight equation: 
f83 -t -T = Y M (E -e Sin E) . (4.2-4) 

<<<PAGE 231>>>

216 POSITION AND VELOCITV-A FUNCTION OF TIME Ch. 4 
Thus

Solving this equation for E and substituting for e cos E from equation 
(4.6-10), we get 
And so 
r =$a .e Sin E 
r (4.6-11) 
Finally, solving this 
rr = r • v, we obtain equation for e sin E and again noting that 
e sin E =.!.....:..Y 
Vfia (4.6-12) 
which is particularly useful since the term e sin E appears in the Kepler 
time-of-flight equation. 
For the hyperbolic eccentric anomaly we will exploit the 
relationship between E and F to arrive at a set of identities involving F 
which are analogous to the ones involving E. 
The. relationship between the eccentric anomalies and the true 
anomaly, v, is given by 
cos E = e + cos V 1 + e cos V 
cosh F = e + cos V 
1 + e cos V 
From which we may conclude that 
cosh F = cos E 
Using the identity cosh 8 =cos i8 we see that apparently 
E= ± iF (4.2-8) 
(4.2-21) 
(4.6-13) 
In other words, when E is a real number, F is imaginary; when F is a 
real number, E is imaginary. The ± sign is a result of defining E in the

Sec 4.6 THE KEPLER PROBLEM 217 
range from 0 to 2rr while F is defined from minus infinity to plus 
infinity. The proper sign can always be determined from physical 
reasoning. 
From equation (4.6-7) we can write 
xw= a (cos E -ell 
= a (cos iF -e). 
But cos iF = cosh F, so 
Xw =a(rosh F -e). 
Similarly , 
Yw=a�sinE 
=ai�siniF, 
But i sin iF = -sinh F, so 
Yw=-a� sinh F. 
The following identities are obtained in analogous fashion: 
r = a (1 -e cosh F) 
r ecosh F= 1- -a 
r • v esinh F =_� 
v -Ila (4.6-14) 
(4.6-15) 
(4.6-16) 
(4.6-17) 
(4.6-18) 
This last identity is particularly useful since the expression e sinh F 
appears in the hyperbolic time-of-flight equation.

have drawn an orbit in the perifocal system. Although an ellipse is 
shown we need to make no assumption concerning the type of conic.

written as 
xw= r cos V (4.6-19)

4;6.3 The f and 9 Expressions in Terms of Eccentric Anomaly. 
From equations (4.6-7) and (4.6-8), the rectangular components of

Xw = - a E sin E . 
But, using equation (4.6-11) 
�w = -I-Jlla sin E. r

Yw = a � E cos E .

As before we will use the relationship that 6E = i6F and the

4.6.4 Kepler Problem Algorithm. In classical terms, the Kepler 
problem is basically the solution of the equation 
M = E -8 sin E (4.2-6) 
where M is known as n (t -T). M can be obtained from 
M = � (t -to) -2k7T + Mo . 
. V a3 
Even though equation (4.2-6) is one equation in one unknown, it is 
transcende ntal in E; there is no way of getting E by itself on the left of 
the equal sign. Kepler himself realized this, of course, and Sma1l4 tells 
us: "But, with respect to the direct solution of the problem-from the 
mean anomaly given to find the true-[Kepler] tells us that he found it 
impracticable, and that he did not believe there was any geometrical or 
rigorous method of attaining to it." 
The first approximate solution for E was quite naturally made by 
Kepler himself. The next was by Newton in the Principia; from a 
graphical construction involving the cycloid he was able to find an 
approximate solution for the eccentric anomaly. A very large number 
of analytical and graphical solutions have since been discovered because 
nearly every prominent mathemat ician since Newton has given some

It would, of course, be possible to graph Kepler's equation as we 
have done in Figure 4.6-4 and then determine what value of E 
corresponds to a known value of M; but this is not very accurate. Since 
we can derive an analytical expression for the slope of the M vs E curve, 
we can formulate a Newton iteration scheme as follows: first select a 
trial value for E-call it En' Next, compute the mean anomaly, Mn, that 
results from this trial value. 
Now, select a new trial value, En+1' from

where dM / dEl is the slope of the M vs E curve at the trial value, 
E E=E 
n. n 
The slope expression is obtained by differentiating Kepler's 
equation. 
dM = 1 -e cos E. dE 
Therefore, equation (4.6-36) may be written as 
E = E + 
n+l n -e cos En (4.6-40) 
When the difference M - Mn becomes acceptably small we can quit 
iterating. Since the slope of the M vs E curve approaches zero at E = 0 
0f 21(-when e is nearly 1, we can anticipate convergence difficulties for 
the near-parabolic orbits. Picking a first trial value of El = 7r should 
guarantee convergence, however, even when e is nearly 1. 
Once E is determined by any method, the true anomaly may be 
found from equation (4.2-12). Exactly analogous methods may be used 
to solve for von a hyperbolic orbit when a, e, va and the time-of-flight, 
t -to' are given. 
We may now state the algorithm for solving the Kepler problem. It 
can be used forLW or�E. 
1. From fa and va determine r 0' a, e, p and va· 
2. Given t -to' solve the appropriate Kepler time-of-flight equation 
for E or F using a trial-and-error method such as the Newton iteration. 
Solve for V if needed. 
3. Solve for r from the polar equation of a conic or equation 
(4.2-14) or the similar expression for the hyperbola. 
4. Evaluate the f and 9 expressions above using r, r 0' p and LW (or 
�Eor�F). 
5. Determine f and V from equations (4.4-18) and (4.4-19). 
The algorithm using �E (or �F) is shorter than using LW since neither 
p or V need to be calculated.

ORBIT DETERMINATION 
FROM TWO POSITIONS AND TIME 
Probably all mathematicians today regret that Gauss was 
deflected from his march through darkness by "a couple of 
clods of dirt which we call planets" -his own words-which 
shone out unexpectedly in the night sky and led him astray. 
Lesser mathematicians than Gauss-Laplace for instance­
might have done all that Gauss did in computing the orbits 
of Ceres and Pallas, even if the problem of orbit 
determination was of a sort which Newton said belonged to 
the most difficult in mathematical astronomy. But the 
brilliant success of Gauss in these matters brought him 
instant recognition as the first mathematician in Europe 
and thereby won him a comfortable position where he 
could work in· comparative peace; so perhaps those 
wretched lumps of dirt were after all his lucky stars. 
-Eric Temple Bell! 
5.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
The most brilliant chapter in the history of orbit determination was 
written by Carl Fredrich Gauss, a 24-year-old German mathematician, 
in the first year of the 19th century. Ever since Sir William Herschel 
had discovered the seventh planet, Uranus, in 1781, astronomers had 
been looking for further members of the solar system-especially since 
Bode's law predicted the existence of a planet between the orbits of 
Mars and Jupiter. A plan was formed dividing the sky into several areas 
which were to be searched for evidence of a new planet. But, before the 
search operation could begin one of the prospective participants, 
227

Giuseppe Piazzi of Palermo, on New Year's day of 1801, observed what 
he first mistook for a small comet approaching the sun. The object 
turned out to be Ceres, the first of the swarm of asteroids or minor 
planets circling the sun between Mars and Jupiter. 
It is ironic that the discovery of Ceres coincided with the publication 
of the famous philosopher Hegel of a vitriolic attack on astronomers for 
wasting their time in search for an eighth planet. If they paid some 
attention to philosophy, Hegel asserted, they would see immediately 
that there can be precisely seven planets, no more, no less. This slight 
lapse on Hegel's part no doubt has been explained by his disciples even 
if they cannot explain away the hundreds of minor planets which mock 
his philosophic ban. 
To understand why computing the orbit of Ceres was such a triumph 
for Gauss, you must appreciate the meager data which was available in 
the case of sighting a new object in the sky. Without radar or any other 
means of measuring the distance or velocity of the object, the only 
information astronomers had to work with was the line-of-sight 
direction at each sighting. To compound the difficulty in the case of 
Ceres, Piazzi was only able to observe the asteroid for about 1 month 
before it was lost in the glare of the sun. The challenge of rediscovering 
the insignificant clod of dirt when it reappeared from behind the sun 
seduced the intellect of Gauss and he calculated as he had never 
calculated before. Ceres was rediscovered on New Year's day in 1802, 
exactly 1 year later, precisely where the ingenious and detailed 
calculations of the young Gauss had predicted she must be found.l 
The method which Gauss used is just as pertinent today as it was in 
1802, but for a different reason. The data that Gauss used to determine 
the orbit of Ceres consisted of the right ascension and declination at 
three observation times. His method is much simplified if the original 
data consists of two position vectors and the time-of-flight between 
them. The technique of determining an orbit from two positions and· 
time is of considerable interest to modern astrodynamics since it has 
direct application in the solution of intercept and rendezvous or 
ballistic missile targeting problems. Because of its importance, and for 
convenience in referring to it later, we will formally define the problem 
of orbit determination from two positions and time and give it a 
name-"the Gauss problem." 
5.2 THE GAUSS PROBLEM-GENERAL METHODS OF SOLUTION 
We may define the Gauss problem as follows: Given rl, r2, the 
time-of-flight from rl to r2 which we will call t, and the direction of

motion, find VI and v2• 
By "direction of motion" we mean whether the satellite is to go 
from f I to f2 the "short way," through an angular change (w) of less 
than 7r radians, or the "long way," through an angular change greater 
than 7r. 
Obviously, there are an infinite number of orbits passing through fl 
and f2' but only two which have the specified time-of-flight-one for 
each possible direction of motion.

with same time-of-flight 
One thing is immediately obvious from Figure 5.2-1; the two vectors 
fl and f2 uniquely define the plane of the transfer orbit. If the vectors 
fl and f2 are collinear and in opposite directions (w = 7r), the plane of 
the transfer orbit is not determined and a unique solution for VI and v2 
is not possible. If the two position vectors are collinear and in the same 
directiOll (W = 0 or 27r), the orbit is a degenerate conic, but a unique 
solution is possible for VI and V 2' In the latter case, the method of 
solution may have to be modified as there may be a mathematica l 
singularity in the equations used, particularly if the parameter, p, 
appears in the denominator of any expression. 
The relationship between the four vectors fl, f2' VI and v2 is 
contained in the f and 9 expressions which were developed in Chapter 
4. It is not surprising, therefore, that nearly every known method for 
solving the Gauss problem may be derived from the f and 9 relations. 
We will rewrite them below making an obvious change in notation to be 
consistent with the definition of the Gauss problem:

Since equat!o�s (5.2-7) and (5.2-2) express the vectors VI and v2 in 
terms of f, g, f, 9 and the two known vectors r1 and r2, the, solut�on to 
the Gauss problem is reduced to evaluating the scalars f, g, f and g. 
Consider equations (5.2-3), (5.2-4) arid (5.2-5). There are seven 
variables-f1, r2, bv., t, p, a and �E; but the first four are known, so 
what we have is three equations in three unknowns. The only trouble is 
that the equations are transcende ntal in nature, so a trial-and-error 
solution is necessary. We may outline the general method of solution as 
follows: 
1. Guess a trial value for one of the three unknown s, p, a or � 
directly or indirectly by guessing some other parameter of the transfer 
orbit which in tum establishes p, a or �E. 
2. Use equations (5.2-3) and (5.2-5) to compute the remaining two 
unknowns. 
3. Test the result by solving equation (5.2-4) for t and check it 
against the given value of time-of-flight. 

<<<PAGE 246>>>

Sec. 5.3 SOLUTION VIA UNIVERSAL VARIABLES 231 
4. If the computed value of t does not agree with the given value, 
adjust the trial value of the iteration variable and repeat the procedure 
until it does agree. 
This last step is perhaps the most important of all, since the method 
used to adjust the trial value ofthe iteration variable is what determines 
how quickly the procedure converges to a solution. This point is 
frequently overlooked by authors who . suggest a method of 
accomplishing the first three steps but give no guidance on how to 
adjust the iterative variable. 
Several methods for solving the Gauss problem will be discussed in 
this chapter, including the Qriginal method suggested by Gauss. In each 
case, a scheme for adjusting the trial value of the iterative variable will 
be suggested and the relative advantages of one method over another 
will be discussed. What we are referring to as the Gauss problem can 
also be stated in terms of the Lambert theorem. Solution using the 
Lambert theorem will not be treated here because the universal variable 
method avoids much of the awkwardness of special cases which must be 
treated when applying Lambert's theorem. 
5.3 SOLUTION OF THE GAUSS PROBLEM 
VIA UNNERSAL VARIABLES 
In discussing general methods for solving the Gauss problem earlier 
in this chapter, we indicated that the f and 9 expressions provide us 
with three independent equations in three unknowns, p, a and L'£ or 
6F. Later we will show that a trial-and-error solution based on guessing 
a value of p can be formulated. A direct iteration on the variable a is 
more difficult since picking a trial value for a does not determine a 
unique value for p or 6E. A solution based on guessing a trial value of 
6E or 6F would work, however, and would enable us to use the 
universal variables, x and z, introduced in Chapter 4, since Z =L'£2 and 
-z=6F2. 
To see how such a scheme might work, let's write the expressions for 
f, g, {and 9 in terms of the universal variables:

Substituting for x in equation (5.3-3) and cancellingvwp from both

We can write this equation more compactly if we define a constant, 
A, as . rrr-sin b.v V'l'2 A

We will also find it convenient to define another auxiliary variable, 
y, such that 
r 1 r 2 (1 -cos b.v) 
y = (5.3-8)

Using these definitions of A and y, equation (5.3-6) may be written

We can also express X in equation (5.3-5) more concisely:

The simplification of the equations resulting from the introduction 
of the constant, A, and the auxiliary variable, y, can be extended to the

(5.3-4), we can obtain the following simplified expressions: If=1-LI r I (5.3-13)

1. From fI' f2 and the "direction of motion," evaluate the 
constant, A, using equation (5.3-7). 
2. Pick a trial value for z. Since z = .0,E2 and -z =.0,P , this amounts 
to guessing the change in eccentric anomaly. The usual range for z is 
from minus values to (27T)2. Values of'z greater than (27Tf correspond 
to changes in eccentric anomaly of more than 27T and can occur only if 
the satellite passes back through f 1 enroute to f2. 
3. Evaluate the functions Sand C for the selected trial value of z 
using equations (4.4-10) and (4.4-11). 
4. Determine the auxiliary variable, y, from equation (5.3-9). 
5. Determine x from equation (5 .3-10). 
6. Check the trial value of z by computing t from equation (5.3-12) 
and compare it with the desired time-of-flight. If it is not nearly the 
same, adjust the trial value of z and repeat the procedure until the 
desired value of t is obtained. A Newton iteration scheme for adjusting 
z will be discussed in the next section. 
7. When the method has converged to a solution, evaluate t, 9 and 9 
from equations (5.3-13), (5.3-14) and (5.3-15), then compute VI and v2 
from equations (5.3-16) and (5.3-17). 
5.3.1 Selecting A New Trial Value of z. Although any iterative 
scheme, such as a Bolzano bisection technique or linear interpolation, 
may be used successfully to pick a better trial value for z, a Newton 
iteration, which converges more rapidly, may be used if we can 
determine the slope of the t vs z curve at the last trial point. 
The derivative, dt / dz, necessary for a Newton iteration can be 
determined by differentiating equation (5.3-12) for t:

EXAMPLE PROBLEM. From radar measurements you know the 
position vector of a space object at 0432:00Z to be: rl =0.51 +0.6J + 
0.7K DU. At 0445 :OOZ the position of the object was: r2 = 0.01 + 1.ill

object could have moved from position one to position two. Assume 
the object occupies each position only once during this time period. 
There is only one path for a given direction of motion. Thus the two 
paths sought are the "short way" and "long way." We first find VI and v2 for each direction by solving the Gauss problem and then use rl, VI 
and the method of Chapter 2 to solve for the orbital elements. 
To facilitate our solution let us define an integer quantity DM, 
"direction of motion":

Then using the given r vectors and these v vectors we have specified the 
two paths. 
Notice that the long way trajectory is a hyperbola: 
Energy = 0.2553 DU2 /TU2 
Eccentricity = 3.96 
and perigee radius = 0.0191 DU 
while the short way is an ellipse: 
Energy = -4.636 DU2/TU2 
Eccentricity = 0.076832 
and perigee radius = 0.9958 0 U 
Since the hyperbola passes through the earth between the two 
positions, and the ellipse intersects the earth (but only after it passes 
the second position), the ellipse is the only trajectory a real object 
could travel on. This result illustrates the beauty of the universal 
variables approach to this problem: with one set of equations we solved 
problems involving two different types of conics. 
There is one pitfall in the solution of the Gauss problem via universal 
variables which you should be aware of. For "short way" trajectories, 
where f::1) is less than 7T, the t vs z curve crosses the t = Oaxis at some 
negative value of z as shown in Figure 5.3-1. In other words, there is a 
negative lower limit for permissable values of z when f::1) < 7T. The 
reason for this may be seen by examining equations (5.3-8) and (5.3-9). 
From equation (5.3-8) it is obvious that y cannot be negative, yet 
equation (5.3-9) will result in a negative value for y if f::1) < 7T and z is 
too large a negative number. This is apparent from the fact that A is 
positive whenever f::1) < 7T and negative whenever 7T <f::1) < 27T. Because 
both C and S become large positive numbers when z is large and 
negative (see Figure 4.5-2), the expression 
A( 1 -zS) 
yfC 
can become a large positive number if A is positive. Whenever 
A( 1 -zS) 
---- > r1 + r2 
VC the value of y will be negative and x will be imaginary in equation 
(53-1O} 

<<<PAGE 256>>>

Sec. 5.4 THE p-ITERATION METHOD 241 
Any computational algorithm for solving the Gauss problem via 
universal variables should include a check to see if y is negative prior to 
evaluating x. This check is only necessary when A is positive. F or "long 
way" trajectories y is positive. for all values of z and the t vs z curve 
approaches zero asymptotically as z approaches minus infinity. 
5.4 THE p-ITERA TION METHO D· 
The next method of solving the Gauss problem that we will look at 
could be called a direct p-iteration technique. It differs from the 
p-iteration method first proposed by Herrick and Liu in 19596 since it 
does not directly involve eccentricity. The method consists of guessing 
a trial value of p from which we can compute the other two unknowns, 
a and ""E. The trial values are checked by solving for t and comparing it 
with the given time-of-flight. 
The p-iteration method presented below is unusual in that it will 
permit us to develop an analytical expression for the slope of the t vs p 
curve; hence, a Newton iteration scheme is possible for adjusting the 
trial value of p. 
5.4.1 Expressing p as a Function of ""E. From equation (5.2-5), if

rearranging yields

is to find an expression for a as a function of p and the given 
information. We will find it convenient to define three constants which 
may be determined from the given information: 
k = r 1 r 2 (1 - cos bJ)) 
m = r 1 r 2 (1 + cos bJ)) • 
Using these definitions, a may be written as k k 
a = -----
------=--p(1 • COSLl.E) 2p sin 2_Ll._E 
k 2 (5.4-4) 
(5.4-5) 
Using these same definitions, and noting that � cos '2 = 
± .J r 1 r 2 (1 + cos Ll.v) , we can rewrite equation (5.4-3) as 
k p = Ll.E (5.4-6) 
Q ± y'2ni COS-. 2 
Ll.E Solving for cos2, we get 
Ll.E k -Qp CO� = ± y'2ni p 
Ll.E (k -Qp)2 cos2-2 2mp2 (5.4-7) 
If we substitute this last expression into equation (5.4-5) and 
simplify, we obtain 
a= m p (5.4-8)

of a is determined.

Figure 5.4-1 Typical plot of a vs p for a fIxed r1 and r2 
In Figure 5.4-1 we have drawn a typical plot of a vs p for a fixed r 1 ' 
r2 and Dv less than 'fr. Notice that for those orbits where a is positive 
(ellipses), a may not be smaller than some minimum value, am The 
point where a is a minimum corresponds to the "minimum energy 
ellipse" joining r1 and r2. 
The two points where a approaches infInity correspond to parabolic 
orbits joining r1 and r2. The values' of p that specify the parabolic 
orbits are labeled Pj and Pjj and will be important to us later. 
Those orbits where a is negative are hyperbolic. The limiting case 
where P approaches infinity and a approaches zero is the straight-line 
orbit connecting r1 and r2• It would require infinity energy and have a 
time-of· flight of zero. 
5.4.3 Checking the Trial Value of p. Once we have selected a trial 
value of P and computed a from equation (504-8), we' are ready to solve 
for t and check it against the given time-of-flight. First, however, we 
need to determine � (or .6.F in case a is negative). 

<<<PAGE 259>>>

244 ORBIT DETERMI NATION FROM 2 POSITIONS & TIME Ch. 5 
From the trial value of P and the known information, we can 
compute f, 9 and f from equations (5.2-3), (5.2-4) and (5.2-5). If a is 
positive, we can determine .6.E from equations (5.2-3) and (5.2-5): 
r1 
cos .6.E = 1 -a-(1 -f) (5.4-9) 
(5.4-10) 
If a is negative, the corresponding f and 9 expressions involving .6.F 
yield 
r1 
cosh.6.F = 1 --(1 -f) (5.4-11) 
a 
Since we always assume .6.F is positive, there is no ambiguity in 
determining � from this one equation. 
The time-of-flight may now be determined from equation (5.2-4) or 
the corresponding equation involving .6.F: 
t = 9 + If (.6.E -sin .6.E) 
;Tar t = 9 + vi -;;-(sinh.6.F -.6.F). (5.4-12) 
(5.4-13) 
5.4.4 The t vs P Curve. Before discussing the method of selecting a 
new trial value of p, we need to understand what the t vs p curve looks 
like. To get a feeling for the problem, let's look at the family of orbits 
that can be drawn between a given £1 and £2. In Figure 5.4-2 we have 
drawn £1 and £2 to be of equal length. The conclusions we will reach 
from examining this illustration also apply to the more general case 
where £1 =1=£2· 
First, let's consider the orbits that permit traveling from £1 to £2 the 
"short way." The quickest way to get from £1 to £2 is obviously along 
the straight line from £1 to £2. This is the limiting case where p is 
infinite and t is zero. As we take longer to make the journey from £1 to 
£2' the trajectories become more "lofted" until we approach the 
limiting case where we try to go through the open end of the parabola 
joining £1 and £2· Notice that, although t approaches infInity for this 
orbit, p approaches a finite minimum value which we will call Pi. 
If we look at "long way" trajectories, we see that the limiting case of 

<<<PAGE 260>>>

Sec. 5.4 THE p-ITERA TION METHOD 245 
zero time-of-flight is achieved on the degenerate hyperbola that goes 
straight down r 1 to the focus and then straight up r2 and has p equal to 
zero. As we choose trajectories with longer times-of-flight, P iricreases 
until we reach the limiting case where we try to travel through the open 
end of the other parabola that joins r1 and r2• For this case, t 
approaches infinity as P approaches a finite limiting value which we will 
call Pjj. 
From the discussion above, we can construct a typical plot of t vs P 
for a fixed r1 and r2. In Figure 5.4-3 the solid line represents "shoit 
way" trajectories and the dashed line represents "long way" 
traj ectories. 
For l'J) less than IT, P must lie between Pj and infinity; for t:sv greater 
than IT, P must lie between o and Pjj. Since it is important tharthe first 
trial value, as well as all subsequent guesses for p, lie within the 
prescribed limits, we should first compute Pj or Pjj.

5.4.5 Selecting a New Trial Value of p. The method used to adjust 
the trial value of p to give the desired time-of-flight is crucial in 
determining how rapidly p converges to a solution. Several simple 
methods may be used successfully, such as the "Bolzano bisection" 
technique or "linear interpolation" (regula falsi). 
In the bisection method we must find two trial values of p; one that 
gives too small a value for t, and one that gives too large a value. The 
solution is then bracketed and, by choosing our next trial value half 
way between the first two, we can keep it bracketed while reducing the 
interval of uncertainty to some arbitrarily small value. 

<<<PAGE 262>>>

Sec. 5.4 THE p-ITERATION METHOD 247 
In the linear interpolation method we choose two trial values of 
p-call them Pn-1 and Pn. If tn-1 and tn are the times-of-flight 
corresponding to these trial values of p, then we select a new value from 
Pn+1 = Pn + (t-tn)(Pn-Pn-1) 
(tn -tn-1) (5.4-16) 
This scheme can be repeated, always retaining the latest two trial 
values of P and their corresponding times-of-flight for use in computing 
a still better trial value from equation (5.4-16). It is not necessary that 
the initial two trial values bracket the answer.

An even faster method is a Newton iteration, but it requires that we 
compute the slope of the t vs P curve at the last trial value of p. If this 
last trial value is called Pn and tn is the time-of-flight that results from 
it, then a better estimate of p may be obtained from

Sec. 5.5 GAUSS PROBLEM USING f AND 9 SERIES 251 
To evaluate the slope at Pn, the values of g, a, t and .6E or Ll.F 
obtained from the trial value, Pn, should be used in equation (5.4-22) 
or (5.4-23). 
We can summarize the steps involved in solving the Gauss problem 
via the p-iteration technique as follows: 
1. Evaluate the constants k, Q and m from r], r2 and Ll.II using 
equations (5.4-4). . 
2. Determine the limits on the possible values of P by evaluating Pj 
and Pjj from equations (5.4-14) and (5.4-15). 
3. Pick a trial value of P within the appropriate limits. 
4. Using the trial value. of p, solve for a from equation (5.4-8). The 
type conic orbit will be known from the value of a. 
5. Solve for f, 9 and f from equations (5.2·3), (5.2-4) and (5.2-5). 
6. Solve for Ll.E or Ll.F, as appropriate , using equations (5.4-9) and 
(5.4-10) or equation (5.4-11). 
7. Solve for t from equation (5.4-12) or (5.4-13) and compare it 
with the desired time-of-flight. 
8. Adjust the trial value of P using one of the iteration methods 
discussed above until the desired time-of-flight is obtained. 
9. Evaluate 9 from equation (5.2-6) and then solve for VI and v2 
using equations (5.2-7) and (5.2-2). 
The p-iteration method converges in all cases except when r] and r2 
are collinear. Its main disadvantage is that separate equations are used 
for the ellipse and hyperbola. This defect may be overcome by using 
the universal variables X and z introduced in Chapter 4 and discussed 
earlier in this chapter. 
5.5 THE GAUSS PROBLEM USING THE f AND 9 SERIES 
In this section we will develop another method for solving the Gauss 
problem. Instead of using the f and 9 expres�ions, we will develop and 
use the f and 9 series. As stated earlier, the motion of a body in a 
Keplerian orbit is in a plane which contains the radius vector from the 
center of force to the body and the velocity vector. If we know the 
position ro and the velOCity Vo at some time to then we know that the 
position vector at any time t can be expressed as a linear combination 
of ro and Vo because it always lies in the same plane as ro and vo' The 
coefficients of ro and Vo in this linear combination will be functions of 
the time and will depend upon the vectors ro and vo.

We can determine the functions f and 9 by expanding r in a Taylor 
series expansion around t = to 
r= L (5.5-2) 
n=O 
where 
(5.5-3) 
Since the motion is in a plane all the time derivatives ofr must lie in the 
plane of rand v. Therefore, we can write in general

r (n+ 1 ) = F r + F v + G V + G r n n n n

formulas

Gn+1 = F n + Gn . (5.5-7)

From which it is obvious that F 0 = 1 and Go = O. 
5.5.1 Development of the Series Coefficients. Before continuing 
with the development of the functions F nand Gn it is convenient to 
digress at this point to introduce and discuss three quantities u, p and q 
which will be useful later. We define them as follows: 
u ==I:L 
r3 
p == _1 -(r . v) (not the semi-latus rectum) 
r2 
q ==� (V)2 -u. 
r (5.5-W) 
(5.5-11) 
(5.5-12) 
These quantities can all be determined if the position r and the velocity 
v are known. These quantities are useful because their time derivatives 
can be expressed in terms of the quantities u, p, q, as we shall 
demonstrate. 
(5.5-13) 
Using the relationship r· V = rr and the definition of p,this can be 
written: 
(5.5-14) 
(5.5-15) 
Using the relationship r· V = rr .and the equation of motion f = -ur, 
this can be written: p= _1 (V)2 _ u -L.(r' V)2 
r2 r4 
Using the definitions of q and p we have (5.5-16)

Similarly,

Using the definition of P, q and the expression for U we have 
q=-2p (u +q +u) +3up 
q = -p (u + 2q) .

After this digression we are now in a position to carry out the 
recursion of the F nand Gn· We have already seen that 
Applying the recursion formulas (5.5-7) and (5.5-8) we obtain 
F = F auG =0

It may be appropriate to stop at this point and check that these 
results make sense. Writing equation (5.5-4) for n = 0, 1, 2 we have:

In the next step we shall see the value of u, p and q.

Continuing,

laborious; therefore, the algebra was programmed on a computer to get 
further terms which are indicated in Table 5.5-1, but we shall use our

5.5.2 Solution of the Gauss Problem. The f and 9 series may be used 
. to solve Gauss' problem if the time interval between the two 
measurements is not too large. This method has the advantage of not 
having a quadrant ambiguity as some other methods. We assume that 
we are given the positions r � and r at times t and t and we wish to 
find v. From equation (5.5-1) 2 I 2 
from which we find 
r2 -f(rI,rI,7)rI 
g(rI,fI,7) (5.5·28) 
(5.5·29) 
If we guess a value of VI we can compute f and 9 and then can use 
equation (5.5·29) to compute a new value of VI' This method of 
successive approximations can be continued until VI is determined with 
sufficient accuracy. This method converges very rapidly if 7 is not too 
large. 
5.6 WE ORIGINAL GAUSS METHOD 
In the interest of its historic and illustrative value we will exa· 
mine the method which was originally proposed by Gauss in 
18094. Although we will assume that the transfer orbit connecting r I 
and r is an ellipse, the extension of the method to cover hyperbolic 2 orbits will be obvious. The derivation of the necessary equations "from 
scratch" is long and tedious and may be found in Escobal3 or 
Moulton5. Since all of the relationships we need are contained in the f 
and 9 expressions, we will present a very compact and concise 
development of the Gauss method using only equations (5.2·3), (5.2-4) 
and (5.2·5).

vector sweeps out the shaded area shown in Figure 5.6-1. In Chapter 1 
we showed that area is swept out at a constant rate: 
dt = 2 dA. h 
Since h =�the area of the shaded sector, As, becomes (1.7-7) 
where t is the time-of-flight from r 1 to r . 
The area of the triangle formed by t�e two radii and the subtended 
chord is just one-half the base times the altitude; so 
Figure 5.6-1 Sector and triangle area 
Gauss called the ratio of sector to triangle area Y, thus 
(5.6-1) 
The Gauss method is based on obtaining two independent equations 
relating Y and the change in eccentric anomaly, L£. A trial value of Y 
(usually Y � 1) is selected and the first equation is solved for L£. This 

<<<PAGE 275>>>

260 ORBIT DETERMI NATION FROM 2 POSITIONS & TIME Ch. 5 
value of L'£ is then used in the second equation to compute a better 
trial value of y. This technique of successive approximations will 
converge rapidly if y is nearly one, but fails completely if the radius 
vector spread is large. 
The first equation of Gauss will be obtained by substituting for pin 
equation (5.6-1) an expression which containsL'£ as the only unknown.

Substituting for y-from (5.6-4) and solving for y, we get (A C . A C ) ( 1 -cos � ) y = 1 + = -Sin = . S + 2

which is known as "the second equation of Gauss." (5.6-9) 
5.6.4 Solution of the Equations. To review what we have done so 
far, recall that we started with three equations, (5.2-3), (5.24) and 
(5.2-5), in three unknowns, p, a and LE. We then added another 
independent equation, (5.6-1), and one more unknown, y. By a process 
of eliminating p and a between these four equations, we now have 
reduced the set to two equations in two unknowns, y and LE. 
Unfortunately, equations (5.64) and (5.6-9) are transcendenta l, so a 
trial-and-error solution is necessary. 
The first step is to evaluate the constants, sand w, from r I' r2 ,!:JJ 
and t. Next, pick a trial value for y; since this method only works well 
if 6vis less than about 900, a good first guess is y � 1. 
We can now solve Gauss' first equation for 6E, using the trial value of 
y: 
cosf= 1-2(� -s). (5.6-10) 
If we assume that LE is less than 21r (which will always be the case 
unless the satellite passes back through fl enroute to f2), there is no 
problem determining the correct quadrant for LE. 
We are now ready to use this approximate value for6E to compute a 
better approximation for y from Gauss' second equation. This better 
value of y is then used in equation (5.6-10) to compute a still better 
value of 6E, and so on, until two successive approximations for yare 
nearly identical. 
When convergence has occurred, the parameter p may be computed 
from equation (5.4-3) and the f and 9 expressions evaluated. The 
determination of VI and v2 from equations (5.2-7) and (5.2-2) 
completes the solution. 

<<<PAGE 278>>>

Sec. 5.6 THE ORIGINAL GAUSS METHOD 263 
Since the equations above involve .cE, they are valid only if the 
transfer orbit from (1 to (2 is elliptical. The extension of Gauss' 
method to include hyperbolic and parabolic orbits is the subject of the 
next section. 
S.6.5 Extension of Gauss' Method to Any Type of Conic Orbit. If 
the given time-of-flight is short, the right-hand side of equation (5.6-10) 
may become greater than one, indicating that�,E is imaginary. Since we 
already know that when.c:.E is imaginary, .c:.F is real, we can conclude 
that the transfer orbit is hyperbolic when this occurs. Noting that .c:.E = 
i.c:.F and COS i.c:.F = rush .c:.F, equation (5.6-10) may also be written as 
.c:.F (w) 
cosh 2" = 1 -2 y2 - S (5.6-11) 
whenever the right side is greater than one. 
Using the identity, -i sin i.c:.F = sinh .c:.F, equation (5.6-9) becomes (sinh .c:.F -.c:.F ) � 1 -cosh .c:.F) 
y = 1 + . 3.c:.F s + 2· sinh "2 2 (5.6-12) 
These equations may be used exactly as equations (5.6-9) and 
(5.0-10) to determine y. 
If the transfer orbit being sought happens to be parabolic, then .c:.E 
and .c:.F will be zero and both equations (5.6-9) and· (5 .6-12) become 
indeterminate. For this reason, difficulties may be anticipated any time 
.c:.E or .c:.F are close to zero. Gauss solved this problem by defining two 
auxiliary variables, x (not to be confused with the universal variable of 
Chapter 4) and X as follows: 
x = � (1 -cos �) 
X = .c:.E -si n .c:.E 
sin3 .c:.E 
2 
The first equation of Gauss may then be written, as 
y2 = W 
S + x 

<<<PAGE 279>>>

·x = ....Y:i.- -s. y2 
The second equation of Gauss may be written as 
I y = 1 + X (s + x) ·1 (5.6-13) 
(5.6-14) 
Now, it is possible to expand the function X as a power series in x. 
This may be accomplished by first writing the power series expansion 
for X in terms of &, and then expressing 6.E as a power series in x. The 
result, which is developed by Moulton, is 
1 � = 1. ( 1 + §. X + 6·8 x2 + 6·8·10 x3 + .... ) .1 
. 3 5 5·7 5·7·9 . (5.6-15) 
We may now reformulate the algorithm for solving the Gauss 
problem via the Gauss method as follows: 
1. Compute the constants, sand w, from rl, r2, /:;]) and t using 
equations (5.6-2) and (5.6-3). 
2. Assume y � 1 and compute X from equation (5.6-13). 
3. Determine X from equation (5.6-15) and use it to compute a 
better approximation to y from equation (5.6-14). Repeat this cycle 
until y converges to a solution. 
4. The type of conic orbit is determined at this point, the orbit 
being an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola according to whether x is 
positive, zero, or negative. Depending on the type of conic, determine 
6.E or 6.F from equation (5.6-10) or (5.6-11). 
5. Determine p from equation (5.4-3), replacing CDs6.E with CDsh 
6.F in the case of the hyperbolic orbit. 2 
2 .. 6. Evaluate f, g, f and 9 from equations (5.2-3), (5.2-4), (5.2-5) and 
(5.2-6). 7. Solve for VI and v2 from equations (5.2-7) and (5.2-2). 
The method outlined above is perhaps the most accurate and rapid 
technique known for solving the Gauss problem when l:J) is less than 
900; the iteration to determine y fails to converge shortly beyond this 
point.

Sec. 5.7 INTERCEPT AND RENDEZVOUS 
5.7 PRACTICAL APPLICA TIONS OF THE GAUSS 
PROBLEM-INTERCEPT AND RENDEZVOUS 265 
A fundamental problem of astrodynamics is that of getting from one 
point in space to another in a predetermined time. Usually, we would 
like to know what velocity is required at the first point in order to 
coast along a conic orbit and arrive at the destination at the prescribed 
time. If the object of the mission is to rendezvous with some other 
satellite, then we may also be interested in the velocity we will have 
upon arrival at the destination. 
Applications of the Gauss problem are almost limitless and include 
interplanetary transfers, �atellite intercept and rendezvous, ballistic 
missile targeting, and ballistic missile interception. The subject of 
ballistic missile targeting is covered in Chapter 6 and interplanetary 
trajectories are covered in Chapter 8. The Gauss problem is also 
applicable to lunar trajectories which is the subject of Chapter 7. 
Oribt determination from two positions and time is usually part of 
an even larger problem which we may call "mission planning." Mission 
planning includes determining the optimum timing and sequence of 
maneuvers for a particular mission and the cost of the mission in terms 
of f':Nor "characteristic velocity." 
In all but the simplest cases, the problem of determining the 
optimum sequencing of velocity changes to give the minimum total t:lJ 
defies analytical solution, and we must rely on a computer analysis to 
establish suitable "launch windows" for a particular mission. To avoid 
generalities, let's define a hypothetical mission and show how such an 
analysis is performed. 
Let's assume that we have the position and velocity of a target 
satellite at some time to and we wish to intercept this target satellite 
from a ground launch site. We will assume that a single impulse is added 
to the launch vehicle to give it its launch veloci ty. The problem is to 
establish the optimum launch time and time-of-flight for the 
interceptor. 
To make the problem even more specific, we will assume that the 
target satellite is in a nearly circular orbit inclined 650 to the equator 
and at time, to' it is over the Aleutian Islands heading southeastward. 
Our launch site will be at Johnston Island in the Pacific. The situ�tion 
at time to is illustrated in Figure 5.7-2. We will assume that time to is 
1200 GMT. 
The £:,v required to intercept the target depends on two parameters

Sec. 5.7 INTERCEPT AND RENDEZVOUS 267 
Figure 5.7-2 Example intercept problem 
which we are free to choose arbitrarily, the launch time and the 
time-of-flight of the interceptor. Suppose we pick a launch time of 
1205 and a time-of·flight of 5 minutes. The first step in determining�v 
is to find the position and velocity of the interceptor at 1205. Since it 
is stationary on the launch pad at Johnston Island, we need to find the 
position vector from the center of the Earth to the launch site at 1205. 
We have already discussed this problem in Chapter 2. The velocity of 
the interceptor is due solely to earth rotation and is in the eastward 
direction at the site. 
The next step is to determine where the target will be at 1210, 
which is when the intercept will occur. Since we know the position and 
velocity of the target at 1200, we can update r and v to 1210 by solving 
the Kepler problem which we discussed in Chapter 4. 
We now have two position vectors and the time-of-flight between 

<<<PAGE 283>>>

268 ORBIT DETERMINATION FROM 2 POSITIONS & TIME Ch. 5 
them, so we can solve the Gauss problem to find what velocity is 
required at the launch point and what velocity the interceptor will have 
at the intercept point. 
The difference between the required launch velocity and the velocity 
that the interceptor already has by virtue of earth rotation is the �Vl 
that the booster rocket must provide to put the interceptor on a 
collision course with the target. The difference between the velocity of 
the target and interceptor at the intercept point is the �V2 that would 
. have to be added if a rendezvous with the target is desired. Since the 
interceptor must be put on a collision course with the target for a 
rendezvous mission, the total cost of intercept-rendezvous is the scalar 
sum of �Vl and �V2' 
If we carry out the computations outlined above we get �Vl = 4.121 
km/sec and �Vl + �V2 = 11.238 km/sec. But how do we know that 
some other launch time and time-of-flight might not be cheaper in 
terms of �v? To find out, we need to repeat the calculations for various 
combinations of launch time and time-of-flight. The results may be 
displayed in tabular form or as we have done in Figure 5.7-4 where lines 
of constant �v indicate the regions of interest.

5.7.1 Interpreta tion of the t:N Plot. A great deal may be learned 
about a particular mission just by studying a 6V plot. In Figure 5.7-4 
the shaded area represents those conditions that result in the 
interceptor striking the earth enroute to the target. This is most likely 
to occur when the intercept point is located far from the launch site 
and time-of-flight is short. The lowest 6V's for intercept are likely to 
occur when the intercept point is close to the launch site. From Figure 
5.7-2 we can see that this will first occur when the intercept time is 
about 1210 (launch at 1205 plus 5 min time-of-flight). Keep in mind 
that the Earth is rotating and, although the target satellite returns to 
the same position in space �fter one orbital period, the launch site will 
have moved eastward. 
The target satellite in our example will again pass close to Johnston 
Island at about 1340 GMT and another good launch opportun ity will 
present itself. Because of earth rotation, the next pass at 1510 will not 
bring the target satellite nearly so close to the launch site. After 12 
hours the launch site will again pass through the plane of the target's 
orbit and another good series of launch windows should occur. 
In summary , we can say that the most important single factor in 
determining the 6V required for intercept is the choice of where the 
intercept is made relative to the launch site; the closer the intercept 
point is to the launch site, the better. 
A similar 6V plot for intercept-plus-rendezvous would show that the 
lowest 6V's occur when the transfer orbit is coplanar with the target's 
orbit. This can only occur if the launch takes place at the exact time 
the launch site is passing through the target's orbital plane and only 
occurs twice every 24 hours at most. 
5.7.2 Definition of "Optimum Launch Conditions." It would be a 
mistake to assume that those launch conditions which minimize 6V are 
the optimum for a particular mission. We have to know more about the 
mission before we can properly interpret a 6V plot. 
Suppose the mission is to intercept the target as quickly as possible 
with an interceptor that has a fixed 6V capability. In this case 
"optimum" launch conditions are those that result in the earliest 
intercept time without exceeding the 6V limitations of the interceptor. 
There are two common instances where we would be trying to 
minimize 6V. One is where we have a fixed payload and are trying to 
minimize the size of the launch vehicle required to accomplish the 
mission. The other is where we have fixed the launch vehicle and are

Although we have examined a very specific example, the technique 
of producing and interpreting a 6,V plot as an aid in mission planning is 
generally applicable to all types of mission analysis. 
5.8 DETERMINA TION OF ORBIT FROM 
SIGHTING DIRECTIONS AT STATION 
Though one method of orbit determination from optical sightings 
was presented in Chapter 2, now that we have developed the f and 9 
series, another method will be developed. 
Let us assume that we can measure the right ascension and 
declination of an Earth satellite from some station on the Earth at three 
times t1, t2, t3' The unit vector Lj pointing in the direction of the 
satellite from the station is 
(5.8-1) 
The vector r from the center of the Earth is 
r=R+pL. (5.8-2) 
We expand the vector r in terms of the f and 9 series evaluated at t2 so 
that 
(5.8-4) 
(5.8-5) 
(5.8-6) 
This is a set of nine equations in the nine unknowns r2, v2• PI' P2, P3, 
i.e. the three components of r2, the three components of v2 and the 
three quantities PI' P2, P3· 

<<<PAGE 287>>>

We can eliminate the Pj by cross multiply the jth equation by Lj to 
obtain 
(5.8·7) 
(5.8.8) 
(5.8·9) 
Although it appears that there are now nine equations in six unknowns, 
i.e. the components of f2 and V2, in fact only six of the equations are 
independent. Letting the Cartesian components of f2 be x, y and z, the 
components of Vz be X, y and Z, and eliminating the K components, 
these equations are: 
f 1 L 1 zX -f 1 L 1 XZ + 91 L 1 Z� -91 L 1 xi == R 1 xLI Z -R 1 Z L 1 X 
f 1 LIZ Y -f 1 L 1 yZ + 91 LIZ Y -91 L 1 yi == R 1 Y LIZ -R 1 Z L 1 Y

f 3 L3 zy -f 3 L3 yZ + 93 L3 zY -93 L3 yi == R 3 Y L3 Z -R 3 Z L3 Y 
A procedure which may be used to solve this set of equations is as 
follows: 
a. Estimate the magnitude of f2. 
b. Using this estimate compute u =�3' 2 r 
2 c. Compute the values of f l' 91, f3 and 93 using the terms of 
equations (5.5-26) and (5.5-27) which are independent of P2 and q2' 
d. Substitute these values of fl ' 91, f3' 93 and the known values of 
the components of L1, L2, L3, R1, Rz, � into equations (5.8-10) and 
solve the resulting linear algebraic equations for the six unknowns x, y,

necessary to obtain required accuracy. 
f. Repeat steps d and e until process converges to correct values of 
f2 and v2· 
This process converges very rapidly if the time intervals t3 -t2 and 
t2 -t} are not too large, but it is probably too tedious for hand 
computation because of the time required to solve the system of six 
linear algebraic equations several times. The process is well suited to 
solution on a digital computer.

CHAPTER 6 
BALLISTIC MISSIL E TRAJECTORIES 
'Tis a principle of war that when you can use the 
lightning 'tis better than cannon. 
-Napoleon I 
6.1 HISTORICAL BACKG ROUND 
While the purist might insist that the history of ballistic missiles 
stretches back to the first use of crude rockets in warfare by the 
Chinese, long-range ballistic missiles, which concern us in this chapter, 
have a very short history. 
The impetus for developing the long-range rocket as a weapon of war 
was, ironically, the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War I. It 
forbade the Germans to develop long-range artillery. As a result the 
German High Command was more receptive to suggestions for rocket 
development than were military commands in other countries. The 
result is well known. Efforts, begun in 1932 under the direction of then 
Captain Walter Dornberger , culminated in the first successful launch of 
an A-4 ballistic missile (commonly known as the V-2) on 3 October 
1942. During 1943 and 1944 over 280 test missiles were fired from 
Peenemiinde . The first two operational missiles were fired against Paris 
on 6 September 1944 and an attaok on London followed 2 days later. 
By the end of the war in May 1945 over 3,000 V-2's had been fired in 
anger.1 
General Dornberger summed up the use of the long-range missile in 
World War II as "too late.,,2 He might have added that it was not a 
particularly effective weapon as used. It had a dispersion at the target 
of 10 miles over a range of 200 miles and carried a warhead of about

one ton of the high explosive AmatoL 3 Nevertheless, it was more than 
just an extension of long·range artillery-it was the first ballistic missile 
as we know it today. 
After the war there was a mad scramble to "capture" the German 
scientists of Peenemunde who were responsible for this technologica l 
miracle. The United States Army obtained the services of most of the 
key scientists and technicians including Dornberger and Wernher von 
Braun. The Soviets were able to assemble at Khimki a staff of about 80 
men under the former propulsion expert Werner Baum. They were 
assigned the task of designing a rocket motor with a thrust of 260,000 
pounds and later one of 530,000 pounds thrust. 3 
At an intelligence briefing at Wright-Pat terson Air Force Base in 
August 1952, these disquieting facts were revealed by Dornberger who 
had interviewed many of his former colleagues on a return trip to 
Germany. Even more disquieting should have been the report that the 
Soviets had built a separate factory building adjacent to that occupied 
by the German workers. No German was permitted to enter this 
separate building. 
The experts displayed no particular sense of immediacy. After all, 
the atomic bomb was still too heavy to be carried by a rocket. 
According to Dr. Darol Froman of the Los Alamos Scientific 
Laboratory the key question in the 1950's was "When could the AEC 
come up with a warhead light enough to make missiles practical?" 
The ballistic missile program in this country \\liS still essentially in 
abeyance when a limited contract for the ICBM called "Atlas" was 
awarded. But in November 1952 at Eniwetok the thermonuclear 
"Mike" shot ended all doubts and paved the way for the "Shrimp" shot 
of March 1954 which revolution ized the program.4 
Accordingly, in June 1953, Trevor Gardner, Assistant Secretary of 
the Air Force for Research and Development, convened a special group 
of the nation's leading scientists known as the Teapot Committee. The 
group was led by the late Professor John von Neumann of the Institute 
for Advanced Studies at Princeton. They met in a vacant church in 
Inglewood, California, and the result of their study was a 
recommendation to the Air Force that the ballistic missile program be 
reactivated with top priority. 
In October 1953 a study contract was placed with the 
Ramo-Wo oldridge Corporation and by May 1954 the new ICBM 
program had highest Air Force priority. In July 1954, Brigadier General

Bernard A. Schriever was given the monumenta l task of directing the 
accelerated ICBM program and began handpicking a staff of military 
assistants. When he reported to the West Coast he had with him a 
nucleus of four officers-among them Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin P. 
Blasingame, later to become the first Head of the Department of 
Astronautics at the United States Air Force Academy. 
Within a year of its beginning in a converted parochial school 
building in Inglewood the prograin had passed from top Air Force 
priority to top national priority. From 2 main contractors at the 
beginning, the program had, by mid·1959, 30 main contractors and 
more than 80,000 people participating directly. 
Progress was rapid. After three unsuccessful attempts, the first 
successful flight of a Series A Atlas took place on 17 December 1957. 
Only 4 months after the Soviet Union had announced that it had an 
intercontinental ballistic missile, Atlas was a reality. 
While the history of the ballistic missile is both interesting and 
significant, a knowledge of how and why it works is indispensable for 
understanding its employment as a weapon. 
The trajectory of a missile differs from a satellite orbit in only one 
respect-it intersects the surface of the Earth. Otherwise, it follows a 
conic orbit during the free· flight portion of its trajectory and we can 
analyze its behavior according to principles which you already know. 
Ballistic missile targeting is just a special application of the Gauss 
problem which we treated rigorously in Chapter 5. In this chapter we 
will present a somewhat simplified scalar analy sis of the problem so 
that you may gain some fresh insight into the nature of ballistic 
trajectories. To compute precise missile trajectories requires the full 
complexi ty of perturbation theory. In this chapter we are concerned 
mainly with concepts. 
6.2 THE GENERAL BALLISTIC MISSILE PROBLEM 
A ballistic missile trajectory is composed of three parts-the powered 
flight portion which lasts from launch to thrust cutoff or burnout, the 
free-flight portion which constitutes most of the trajectory, and the 
re-entry portion which begins at some ill-defined point where 
atmospheric drag becomes a significant force in determining the 
missile's path and lasts until impact. 
Since energy is continuously being added to the missile during 
powered flight, we cannot use 2-body mechanics to determine its path 

<<<PAGE 295>>>

280 BALLISTIC MIS SILE TRAJECTORIES Ch. 6 
from launch to burnout. The path of the missile during this critical part 
of the flight is determined by the guidance and navigation system. This 
is the topic of an entire course and will not be covered here; 
During free-flight the trajectory is part of a conic orbit-almost 
always an ellipse-which we can analyze using the principles learned in 
Chapter 1. 
Re-entry involves the dissipation of energy by friction with the 
atmosphere. It will not be discussed in this text. 
We will begin by assuming that the Earth does not rotate and that 
the altitude at which re-entry starts is the same as the burnout altitude. 
This latter assumption insures that the free-flight trajectory is 
symmetrical and will allow us to derive a fairly simple expression for 
the free-flight range of a missile in terms of its burnout conditions. 
We will then answer a more practical question-"given rbo' vbo' and 
a desired free-flight range, what flight-path angle at burnout is 
required?" 
Following a discussion of maximum range trajectories, we will 
determine the time-of-flight for the free-flight portion of the trajectory. 
6.2.1 Geomet ry of the Trajectory. Since you are already familiar 
with the terminology of orbital mechanics, such terms as "height at 
burnout," "height of apogee," "flight-path angle at burnout," etc., 
need not be redefined. There are, however, a few new and unfamiliar 
terms which you must learn before we embark on any derivations. 
Figure 6.2.1 defines these new quantities. 
6.2.2 The Nondimensional Paramet er, Q. We will find it very 
convenient to define a nondimensional parameter called Q such that 
(6.2-1) 
Q can be evaluated at any point in an orbit and may be thought of as 
the squared ratio of the speed of the satellite to circular satellite speed 
at that point. Since Va:, =...ji1Tr.

282 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRAJECTORIES Ch. 6 
The value of Qis not constant for a satellite but varies from point to 
point in the orbit. When Q is equal to 1, the satellite has exactly local 
circular satellite speed. This condition (Q = 1) exists at every point in a 
circular orbit and at the end of the minor axis of every elliptical orbit. 
If Q= 2 it means that the satellite has exactly escape speed and is on 
a parabolic orbit. If Q is greater than 2, the satellite is on a hyperbolic 
orbit. It would be rare to find a ballistic missile with a Q equal to or 
greater than 2. 
We can take the familiar energy equation of Chapter 1, 
and substitute for V-the expression p.O/r from equation (6.2-1). This 
yields both of the following relationships which will prove useful: 
(6.2-3) 
or 
IQ=2-�·1 (6.2-4) 
6.2.3 The Free-Flight Range Equatio n. Since the free-flight 
trajectory of a missile is a conic section, the general equation of a conic 
can be applied to the burnout point. 
r = p . bo 1 + e cos vbo 
Solving for cos vbo' we get 
p -rb cos vbo = ___ 0 erbo (6.2-5)

Figure 6.2-2 Symmetrical trajectory 
Since the free-flight trajectory is assumed to be symmetrical (hbo = 
hre), half the free-flight range angle, 'l', lies on each side of the major 
axis, and 
cos � = -cos vbo . 2 
Equation,f6.2-6) above can, therefore, be written as (6.2-7)

We now have an expression for the free-flight range angle in terms of 
p, e, and rbo' Since p = h2/11and. h=rvcos cp, we can use the definition 
of Q to obtain 
P --r2 v2 cos2 ,/. 2 '-----=---='----' �"--= rQ COS cp. 
11 
Now, since p=a(1-e2), 
e2 = 1 -Q. . a 
Substituting p = rQ cCJil cp and a = n' we get 
e2 = 1 + Q(Q -2) cos 2 cp (6.2-9) 
(6_2-10) 
(6.2-11) 
If we now substitute equations (6.2-9) and (6.2-11) into equation 
(6.2-8) we have one form of the free-flight range equation: 
(6.2-12) 
From this equation we can calculate the free-flight range angle resulting 
frbm any given combination of burnout conditions, rbo' vbo and CPbO" While this will prove to be a very valuable equation, it is not 
particularly useful in solving the typical ballistic missile problem which 
can be stated thus: Given a particular launch point and target, the total 
range angle, A, can be calculated as we shall see later in this chapter. If 
we know how far the missile will travel during powered flight and 
re-entry, the required free-flight range angle, 'l1, also becomes known. If 
we now specify rbo and vbo for the missile, what should the flight-path 
angle, ¢ro, be in order that the missile will hit the target? 

<<<PAGE 300>>>

Sec 6.2 GENERAL BALLISTIC MISSILE PROBLEM 285 
In other words, it would be nice to have an equation for ¢bo in 
terms of rbo' vbo and \{r. 
We could, with a little algebra, choose the straightforward way of 
solving the range equation for cos ¢bo. Instead, we will derive an 
expression for ¢bo geometrically because it demonstrates some rather 
interesting geometrical properties of the ellipse. 
\

Figure 6.2-3 Ellipse geometry 
6.2.4 The Flight-Path Angle Equation. In Figure 6.2-3 we have 
drawn the local horizontal at the burnout point and also the tangent 
and normal at the burnout point. The line from the burnout point to 
the secondary focus, F', is called rbo. 
The angle between the local horizontal and the tangent (direction of 
voo') is the flight-path angle, ¢bo. Since rbo is perpendic ular to the local 
horizontal, and the normal is perpendicular to the tangent, the angle 
between rbo and the normal is also ¢bo. 
Now, it can be proven (although we won't do it) that the angle 

<<<PAGE 301>>>

286 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRAJECTORIES Ch. 6 
between rOO and rbo is bisected by the normal. This fact gives rise to 
many interesting applications for the ellipse. It means, for examp le, 
that, if the ellipse represented the surface of a mirror, light emanating 
from one focus would be reflected to the other focus since the angle of 
reflection equals the angle of incidence. If the ceiling of a room were 
made in the shape of an ellipsoid, a person standing at a particular point 
in the room corresponding to one focus could be heard clearly by a 
person standing at the other focus even though he were whispering. 
This is, in fact, the basis for the so-called "whispering gallery." 
What all this means for our derivation is simply that the angle 
between roo and rbo is 2¢bo' 
Let us concentra te on the triangle formed by F, F' and the burnout 
point. We know two of the angles in this triangle and the third can be 
determined from the fact that the angles of a triangle sum to 1800. If 
we divide the triangle into two right triangles by the dashed line, d, 
shown in Figure 6.2-4, we can express d as 
.'i' d = rb SIn­o 2 
and also as (6.2-13) 
(6.2-14) 
Combining these two equations and noting that sin (1800 -x) = sin 
x, we get 
sin (2¢bO + 'i' \ = r?O sin� . 2 J r bo 2 (6.2-15) 
Since rbo = a(2 -000) from equation (6.2-3) and r60 + rbo = 2a, 
sin �¢ + 'lr) = 2 -Qbo sin � . bo 2 Q 2 bo (6.2-16) 
This is called the flight-path angle equation and it points out some 
interesting and important facts about ballistic missile trajectories.

Figure 6.2-4 Ellipse geometry 
Suppose we want a missile to travel a free-flight range of 900 and it 
has Qbo= .9. Substituting these values into equation (6.2-16) gives us 
sin (2<Pbo + 45°) = 2 -·9 sin 45° = .866 
·9 
But there are two angles whose sine equals .866, so 
and 
There are two trajectories to the target which result from the same 
values of rbo and vbo· The trajectory corresponding to the larger value 
of flight-path angle is called the high trajectory; the trajectory 
associated with the smaller flight-path angle is the low trajectory. 

<<<PAGE 303>>>

288 BALLISTIC MIS SILE TRA JECTORIES Ch. 6 
The fact that there are two trajectories to the target should not 
surprise you since even very short-range ballistic trajectories exhibit this 
property. A familiar illustration of this result is the behavior of water 
discharged from a garden hose. With constant water pressure and nozzle 
setting, the speed of the water leaving the nozzle is fixed. If a target 
well within the maximum range of the hose is selected, the target can 
be hit by a flat or lofted trajectory. 
The nature of the high and low trajectory depends primarily on the 
value of Qbo. If Qbo is less than·1 there will be a limit to how large 'l' 
may be in order that the value of the right side of equation (6.2-16) 
does not exceed 1. This implies that there is a maximum range for a 
missile with Qbo less than 1. This maximum range will always be less 
than 1800 for Qbo less than 1. Provided that 'l'is attainable, there will 
be both a high and a low trajectory to the target. 
If Qbo is exactly 1, one of the trajectories to the target will be the 
circular orbit connecting the burnout and re-entry points. This would 
not be a very practical missile trajectory, but it does represent the 
borderline case where ranges of 1800 and more are just attainable. 
If Qbo is greater than 1, equation (6.2-16) will always yield one 
positive and one negative value for ¢bo' regardless of range. A negative 
¢bo is not practical since the trajectory would penetrate the earth, so 
only the high trajectory can be realized for Qbo greater than 1. 
The real significan ce of Qbogreater than 1 is that ranges in excess of 
1800 are possible. An illustration of such a trajectory would be a 
missile directed at the North American continent from Asia via the 
south pole. While such a trajectory would avoid detection by our 
northern radar "fences," it would be costly in terms of payload 
delivered and accuracy attainable. Nevertheless, the shock value of such 
a surprise attack in terms of what it might do towards creating chaos 
among our defensive forces should not be overlooked by military 
planners. 
Since both the high and low trajectories re sult from the same rbo 
and vbo' they both have the same energy. Because a = -P/2&, the major 
axis of the high and low trajectories are the same length. 
Table 6.2-1 shows which trajectories are possible for various 
combinations of Qbo and 'l'. Figure 6.2-5 should be helpful in 
visualizing each case.

altitude are 1.0817 DU/TU and .025 DU respectively. 'IT is less than

What must the flight-path angle be at burnout? 
Before we can use the flight-path angle equation to find <Pbo' we must 
find Qbo and 'IT.

increases then reaches a maximum and decreases to zero again. Notice

is only one path to the target. 
There are at least two ways that we could derive expressions for the

a<p and set it equal to zero. A simpler method is to see under what 
conditions the flight-path angle equation yields a single solution.

useful for determining the lowest value of Qbo that will attain a given 
range angle. 
6.2.6 Time of Free-Fligh t. The time-of-flight methods developed in 
Chapter 4 are applicable to the free-flight portion of a ballistic missile 
trajectory, but, due to the symmetry of the case where hre = hbo' the 
equations are considerabl y simplified. From the symmetry of Figure 
6.2-7 you can see that the time-of-flight from burnout to re- entry isjust 
twice the time-of-flight from burnout (point 1) to apogee (point 2). 
By inspection, the eccentric anomaly of point 2 is 1T radians or 1800.

Figure 6.2-9 is an excellent chart for making rapid time-of-flight 
calculations for the ballistic missile. In fact, since five variables have 
been plotted on the figure, most ballistic missile problems can be solved 
completel y using just this chart. 
The free-flight time is read from the chart as the ratio tff!IP cs' where 
Wcs is the period of a fictitious circular satellite orbiting at the burnout 
altitude. Values for TI'csmay be calculated from 
(6.2-23) 
or they may be read directly from Figure 6.2-8.

6.3 EFFECT OF LAUNCHING ERRORS ON RANGE 
Variations in the speed, position, and launch direction of the missile 
at thrust cutoff will produce errors at the impact point. These errors are 
of two types-errors in the intended plane which cause either a long or 
a short hit, and out-of-plane errors which cause the missile to hit to the 
right or left of the target. For brevity, we will refer to errors in the 
intended plane as "down-range " errors, and out-of-plane errors as 
"cross-range" errors. 
There are two possible sources of cross-range error and these will be 
treated first. 
6.3.1 Effect of a Lateral Displacement of the Burnout Point. If the 
thrust cutoff point is displaced by an amount, .6X, perpendicular to the 
intended plane of the trajectory and all other conditions are nominal, 
the cross-range error, .6C, at impact can be determined from spherical 
trigonometry. In Figure 6.3-1 we show the ground traces of the intended 
and actual trajectories. For purposes of this example, suppose the 
intended burnout point is on the equator and the launch azimuth is due 
north along a meridian toward the intended target at A. The actual 
burnout point occurs at a point on the equator a distance,.6X to the 
east but with the correct launch azimuth of due north. As a result the 
missile flies up the wrong meridian, impacting at B. 
The arc length.6C represents the cross-range error. It is customary in 
spherical trigonometry to measure arc length in terms of the angle 
subtended at the center of the sphere so that both.6X and.6C may be 

<<<PAGE 313>>>

298 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRAJEC TORIES Ch. 6 
thought of as angles. 
Applying the law of cosines for spherical trigonome try to triangle 
OAB in Figure 6.3-1 and noting that the small angle at 0 is the same as 
�X, we get 
(6.3-1) 
Since both �X and �C will be very small angle s, we can use the small 
. . X2 angle approxunatlOn, cos X � 1 -"2 to simplify equation (6.3-1) to I �C ��X cos 'lr. I (6.3-2) 
Both �X and �C are assumed to be expressed as angles in this 
equation. If they are in radians you can convert them to arc length by 
multiplying by the radius of the Earth; if they are in degrees, you can 
use the fact that a 60 nm arc on the surface of the Earth sub tends an 
angle of 10 at the center. 
Equation (6.3-2) tells us that cross-range error is zero for a free-flight 
range of 900 (5,400 nm) regardless of how far the burnout point is 
displaced out of the intended plane. In Figure 6.3-1, for example, if the 
intended target had been the north pole, the actual burnout point could 
occur anywhere on the equator and we would hit the target so long as

launch azimuth and free-flight range, 'l1, are as planned. Since mostof 
our ICBM's are targeted for ranges of approximately 900, this particular 
source of cross-range error is not as significant as an error in launch 
azimuth as we shall see in the next section. 
Figure 6.3-2 Azimuth error 
6.3.2 Cross-Range Error Due to Incorrect Launch Azimuth. If the 
actual launch azimuth differs from the intended launch azimuth by an 
amount,6(3, a cross-range error, �C, will result. Figure 6.3-2 illustrates 
the geometry of an azimuth error. The ground trace of the actual and 
intended trajectory are shown. Since all launch conditions are assumed 
to be nominal except launch azimuth, the free-flight range of both the 
actual and the intended trajectories is 'l1. The third side of the spher ical 
triangle shown in Figure 6.3-2 is �C, the cross-range error. P. 0 before, 
we will consider �C to be expressed in terms of the angle it subtends at 
the center of the Earth. 
From the law of cosines for spherical triangles we get 
cos �C = cos2 'l1 + sin2 'l1 cos 6(3 (6.3-3) 

<<<PAGE 315>>>

If we assume that both 43 and ,0,C will be very small angles we can use 
2 
the approxima tion, cos X � 1 -x2 ' to simplify equation (6.3-3) to 
(6.3-4) 
This time we see that the cross-range error is a maximum for a 
free-flight range of 900 (or 2700) and goes to zero if \]I is 1800. In 
other words, if you have a missile which will travel exactly half way 
around the Earth, it really doesn't matter in what direction you launch 
it; it will hit the target anyway. 
6.3.3 Effect of Down-Range Displacement of the Burnout Point. An 
error in down-range position at thrust cutoff produces an equal error at 
impact. The effect may be visualized by rotating the trajectory in 
Figure 6.2-1 about the center of the Earth. If the actual burnout point 
is 1 nm farther down-range than was intended, the missile will 
overshoot the target by exactly 1 urn.

the curve (which is gtt:io) at the point corresponding to the intended 
trajectory. The diagram at the right of Figure 6.3-3 illustrates the fact 
that

which is a good approximation for very small values of �bo. 
The expression for gto may be obtained by implicit partial 
differentiation of the free-flight range equation. But first we will derive 
an alternate form of the free-flight range equation. 
The free-flight range equation was derived as equation (6.2-12) of 
this chapter. If we call the numerator of this expression a and· the 
denominator {3, then 
cos�= � 2 {3 
and cot �= a 2 J{32 _ a2 
Substituting for a and {3 we get 
cot � = 1 -Qbo cos2 <Pbo 2 Qbo cos <Pbo -/1 -cos2 <P 
Since J1 -cos2 <Pbo = sin <Pbo'

We now have another form of the free-flight range equation which is 
much simpler to differentiate. Let us first express equation (6.3-10) in 
terms of r bo' vbo and ¢bo'

Sec. 6.3 LAUNCHING ERRORS ON RANGE 303 
which finally reduces to 
(6.3-13) 
This partial derivative, when used in the manner described above, is 
called an influence coefficient since it influences the size of the range 
error resulting from a. particular burnout error. 
While we need equation (6.3-13) to evaluate the magnitude of the 
flight-path angle influence coefficient, the general effect of errors in 
flight-path angle at burnout are apparent from Figure 6.3-3. 
The maximum range condition separates the low trajectories from 
the high trajectories. For all low trajectories the slope of the curve :00 
is positive which means that too high a flight-path angle (a positive 
t4� will cause a positive 6'1' (overshoot); a flight-path angle which is 
lower than intended (a negative l4bJ will cause a negative 6'1' 
(undershoot). 
Just the opposite effect occurs for all high trajectories where 
aaw is ¢bo 
always negative. Too high a cf>bo on the high trajectory will cause the 
missile to fall short and too low a cf>oo will cause an overshoot. If this 
seems strange, remember that water from a garden hose behaves in 
exactly the same way. 
Figure 6.3-3 also reveals that the high trajectory is less sensitive than 
the low trajectory to flight-path angle errors. For a typical ICBM fired 
over a 5,000 nm range, an error of 1 minute (1/60 of a degree) causes a 
miss of about 1 nm on the high trajectory and nearly 3 nm on the low 
trajectory. 
The maximum range trajectory is the least sensitive to flight-pat h 
angle errors. Since ��o = 0 for the maximum range case, equation 
(6.3-5) tells us that 6'1' will be approximately zero for small values of 
t4t0. In fact, the actual range error on a 3,600 nm ICBM flight due to 
a 1 minute error in cf>bo is only 4 feet! 
6.3.5 Down-Range Errors Caused by Incorrect Burnout Height. We 
can use exactly the same approach to errors in burnout height as we 
used in the previous section. A plot of range versus burnout radius, 

<<<PAGE 319>>>

304 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRAJECTORIES Ch. 6 
however, is not particularly interesting since it reveals just what we 
might suspect-if burnout occurs higher than intended, the missile 
overshoots; if burnout occurs too low, the missile falls short of the 
target in every case. 
Following the argume nts in the last section we can say that 
(6.3-14) 
for small values of .6rbo· 
The partial derivative with respect to rbo is much simpler. Again, 
differentiating the range equation (6.3-11) implicitly ,

(6.3-16) 
A burnout error of 1 nm in height on a 5,000 nm range trajectory 
will cause a miss of about 2 nm on the high trajectory and about 5 nm 
on the low trajectory. 
6.3.6 Down-Range Errors Caused by Incorrect Speed at Burnout. 
Speed at �urnout affects range in just the way we would expect-too 
fast and the missile overshoots; too slow and the missile falls short. The 
magnitude of the error is 
(6.3-17) 
where OW/oVbo is given by implicit differentiation of equation

(6.3-18) 
A rough rule-of-thumb is that an error of 1 ft/sec will cause a miss of 
about 1 nm over typical ICBM range. 
An analysis of equation (6.3-18) would reveal that, like the other 
two influence coefficients, a'lr / avbo is larger on the low trajectory 
than on the high. Most ICBM's are programmed for the high trajectory 
for the simple reason that is revealed here-the guidance requirements 
are less stringent and the accuracy is better. 
EXAMPLE PROBLEM. A ballistic missile has the following nominal 
burnout conditions: 
Vbo = .905 DU!TU, rbo = 1.1 DU, ¢bo = 300 
The following errors exist at burnout: 
LWbo = -5 x 10-5 DU/TU, ubo = 5 x 10-4 DU 
.6¢bo= -10-4 radians. 
How far will the missile miss the target? What will be the direction of 
the miss relative to the trajectory plane? 
We will find total down-range error. There is no cross-range error. We 
will need Qbo (.9 for this case) and 'Ir ('Ir � 1000 from Figure 6.2-9).

6.4 THE EFFECT OF EARTH ROTATION 
Up to this point the Earth has been considere d as nonrotating. In the 
two sections which follow we will see what effect earth rotation has on 
the problem of sending a ballistic missile from one fixed point on the 
Earth to another. 
The Earth rotates once on its axis in 23 hrs 56 min producing a 
surface velocity at the equator of 1,524 ft/sec. The rotation is from 
west to east. 
The free-flight portion of a ballistic missile trajectory is inertial in 
character. That is, it remains fixed in the XYZ inertial frame while the 
Earth runs under it. Relative to this inertial XYZ frame, both the 
launch point and the target are in motion. 
We will compensate for motion of the launch site by recognizing 
that the "true velocity" of the missile at burnout is the velocity relative 
to the launch site (which could be measured by radar) plus the initial 
eastward velocity of the launch site due to earth rotation. 
We will compensate for motion of the target by "leading it" slightly. 
That is, we will send our missile on a trajectory that passes through the 
point in space where the target will be when our missile arrives. If we 
know the time-of-flight of the missile, we can compute how much the 
Earth (and target) will turn in that time and can aim for a point the 
proper distance to the east of the target. 
6.4.1 Compens ating for the Initial Velocity of the Missile Due to 
Earth Rotation. We describe the speed and direction of a missile at 
burnout in terms of its speed, v, its flight-path angle , <p, and its azimuth 
angle, {3. If measurements of these three quantities are made from the 
surface of the rotating Earth (by radar, for example), then all three

measurements are erroneous in that they do not indicate the "true" 
speed and direction of the missile. A simple example should clarify this 
point. 
Suppose we set up a cannon on a train which is moving along a 
straight section of track in a northerly direction. If we point the cannon 
due east (perpendicular to the track) and upward at a 450 angle and 
then fire it, an observer on the moving train would say that the 
projectile had a flight-path angle, 1>, of 450, an azimu th, �, of 900 
(east), and a speed of, say 1,000 ft/sec. 
An observer at rest would not agree. He would correctly see that the 
"true" velocity of the projectile includes the velocity of the train 
relative to the "fixed frame." The vector diagram at the right of Figure 
6.4-1 illustrates the true situation and shows that the speed is actually 
somewhat greater than 1,000 ft/sec, the flight-path angle slightly less 
than 450, and the azimuth considerably less than 900. 
Like the observer on the moving train, we make our measureme nts 
in a moving reference frame. This frame is called the topocentric­
horizon system. Hereafter, we will refer to measurements of burnout 
direction in this frame as 1>e and �e. . 
Since a point on the equator has a speed of 1,524 ft/sec in the 
eastward direction, we can express the speed of any launch point on the 
surface of the earth as 
Vo = 1524 cos Lo (ft/sec). (6.4-1) 

<<<PAGE 323>>>

308 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRAJECTORIES Ch. 6 
where Lo is the latitude of the launch site. The subscript "0" is used to 
indicate that this is the initial eastward velocity of the missile even 
while it is on the launch pad. 
We can obtain the south, east, and up components of the true 
velocity, v, by breaking up ve into its components and adding Vo to the 
eastward (E) component. Thus,

(6.4-5) 
The inverse problem of determining ve' ¢e and {3e if you are given v, 
¢ and {3 can be handled in a similar manner; first, break up V into its 
components, then subtract Vo from the eastward component to obtain 
the components ofVe. Once you have the components ofve, finding ve' 
¢e and �e is easy. 
One word of caution: you will have to determine in which quadrant 
the azimuth, �, lies. If you can draw even a crude sketch and visualize 
the geometry of the problem, this will not be difficult. 
It is, of course, v at burnout which determines the missile's

6.4.2 Compen!\llting for Movement of the Target Due to Earth 
Rotation . In Figure 6.4-3 we show the Earth at the instant a missile is 
launched. The trajectory goes from the launch point at A to an "aiming 
point" at B. This aiming point does not coincide with the target at the 
time the missile is launched. Rather, it is a point at the same latitude as 
the target but east of it an amount equal to the number of degrees the 
Earth will turn during the total time the missile is in flight. Hopefully, 
when the missile arrives at point B, the target will be there also. 
The latitude and longitude coordinates of the launch point are Lo 
and No' respectively, so the arc lengthOA in Figure 6.4-3 isjust 900-
Lo. If the coordinates of the target are (4, Nt) then the latitude and 
longitUde of the aiming point should be 4 and Nt + �tA' 
respectively. The term, wEetA' represents the number of degrees the 
Earth turns during the time tt}: The angular rate, wEe' at which the 
earth turns is approximately 15 /hI. 
Arc length 0 B is simply 900 -4, and the third side of the spherical

triangle (the dashed line) is the ground trace of the missile trajectory 
which subtends the angle A The included angle at A is the launch 
azimuth, {3. The angle formed at 0 is just the difference in longitude 
between the launch point and the aiming point,.0.N + wffitA' where.0.N 
is the difference in longitude between launch point and target. 
If we assume that we know the coordinates of the launch point and 
target and the total time-of-flight, tA, we can use the law of cosines for 
spherical triangles to obtain 
cos A = sin La sin Lt 
+ cos La cos Lt cos (.0.N + wffitA) . (6.4-6) 
In applying this equation we must observe certain precautions. The 
longitude difference, .0.N, should be measured from the launch point 
eastward toward the target. The equation yields two solutions for 
A-one angle between 00 and 1800, and another between 1800 and 
3600. These two solutions represent the two great-circle paths between 
the launch point and aiming point. Whether you select one or the other 
depends on whether you want to go the short way or the long way 
around to the target. 
Once we know the total range angle, A, we can solve for the required 
launch azimuth, {3, by applying the law of cosines to the triangle in 
Figure 6.4-3 again-this time considering {3 as the included angle: 
sin Lt = sin La cos A + cos La sin A cos {3 . 
Solving for cos {3, we get 
sin Lt -sin La cosA cos {3 = . cos La Sin A (6.4-7) 
(6.4-8) 
Again, this equation yields two solutions for {3-one between 00 and 
1800 and the other between 1800 and 3600. A simple rule exists for 
determining which value of {3 is correct: If you are going the "short 
way" to the target, and if.0.N + wffitA lies between 00 and 1800 then so 
does {3. If you are firing the missile the "long way" around, then a value 
of .0.N + wffitA between 00 and 1800 requires that {3 lie between 1800 
and 3600. 
It is worth going back for a moment to look at the equations for

Figure 6.4-3 Launch site and "aiming point" at the instant of launch 
total range, A, and launch azimuth, (3. In order to compute (3 we must 
know the coordinates of the launch point and target as well as the 
range, A In order to compute A we must know the time-of-flight, tA 
But, how can we know the time-of-flight if we do not know the 
range being flown? 
The situation is not entirely desperate. In actual practice you would 
begin by "guessing" a reasonable time for tA This value would be used 
to compute an initial estimate for A which in turn would allow you to 
get a first estimate of tff. By adding the times of powered flight and 
re-entry (which also depend somewhat on A) to tff you get a value of 
tA which you can use as your second "guess." The whole process is 
then repeated until the computed value of tA agrees with the estimated 
value. Needless to say, the digital computer is more suited for this type

CHAPTER 7 
LUNAR TRAJECTORIES 
Whichismore usef ul, the Sun or the Moon? ... The Moon 
is the more useful, since it gives us light during the night, 
when it is dark, whereas the Sun shines only in the daytime, 
when it is light anyway. 
7.1 HISTORICAL BACKGRO UND -fictitious philosopher 
created by George Gamow1 
According to the British astronomer Sir Richard A. Proctor, 
"Altogether the most important circumstance in what may be called 
the history of the Moon is the part which she has played in assisting the 
progress of modern exact astronom y. It is not saying too much to assert 
that if the Earth had no satellite the law of gravitation would never 
have been discovered.,,2 
The first complete explanation of the irregularities in the motion of 
the Moon was given by Newton in Book I of the Principia where he 
states: 
For-the Moon, though principally attracted by the Earth, 
and moving round it, does, together with the Earth, move 
round the Sun once a year, and is, according as she is nearer 
or farther from the Sun, drawn by him more or less than 
the center of the Earth, about which she moves; whence 
arise several irregularities in her motion, of all which, the 
321 

<<<PAGE 337>>>

322 LUNAR TRAJECTORIES 
Author in this book, with no less subtility than industry, 
has given a full account. 3 Ch. 7 
Newton nevertheless regarded the Lunar Theory as very difficult and 
confided to Halley in despair that it "made his head ache and kept him 
awake so often that he would think of it no more." 
In the 18th century Lunar Theory was developed analytically by 
Euler, Clairaut, D'Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace. Much of the work 
was motivated by the offer of substantial cash prizes by the English 
Government and numerous scientific societies to anyone who could 
produce accurate lunar tables for the use of navigators in determining 
their position at sea. 
A more exact theory based on new concepts and developed by new 
mathematical methods was published by G. W. Hill in 1878 and was 
finally brought to perfection by the research of E. W. Brown. 
In the first part of this chapter we will describe the Earth-Moon 
system together with some of the irregularities of the Moon's motion 
which have occupied astronom ers since Newton's time. In the second 
part we will look at the problem of launching a vehicle from the Earth 
to the Moon. 
The motion of near-Earth satellites or ballistic missiles may be 
described by 2-body orbital mechanics where the Earth is the single 
point of attraction. Even interplanetary trajectories, which are the 
subject of the next chapter, may be characterized by motion which is 
predominantly shaped by the presence of a single center of attraction, 
.in this case the Sun. What distinguis hes these situations from the 
problem of lunar trajectories is that the vast majority of the flight time 
is spent in the gravitational environment of a single body. 
A significant feature of lunar trajectories is not merely the presence 
of two centers of attraction, but the relative sizes of the Earth and 
Moon. Although the mass of the Moon is only about 1/80th the mass of 
the Earth, this ratio is far larger than any other binary system in our 
solar system. Thus the Earth-Moon system is a rather Singular event, not 
merely because we fmd our abode on the Earth, but because it comes 
close to being a double planet. 
7.2 THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM 
The notion that the Moon revolves about the Earth is somewhat 
erroneous; it is more precise to say that both the Earth and the Moon 

<<<PAGE 338>>>

Sec. 7.2 THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM 323 
revolve about their common center of mass. The mean distance 
between the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon is 384,400 
km4 and the mass of the Moon is 1/81.304 of the mass of the Earth. 
This puts the center of the system 4,671 km from the center of the 
Earth or about 3/4 of the way from the center to the surface. 
Describing the motion of the Earth-Moon system is a fairly complex 
business and begins by noting that the center of mass revolves around 
the Sun once per year (by definition). The Earth and Moon both 
revolve about their common center of mass once in 27.3 days. As a 
result, the longitude of an object such as the Sun or a nearby planet 
exhibits fluctuations with a period of 27.3 days arising from the fact 
that we observe it from the Earth and not from the center of mass of 
the Earth-Moon system. These periodic fluctuations in longitude were, 
in fact, the most reliable source for determining the Moon's mass until 
Ranger 5 flew within 450 miles of the Moon in October 1962. 
The orbital period of the Moon is not constant but is slowly 
increasing at the same time the distance between the Earth and Moon is 
increasing. According to one theory advan ced by G. H. Darwin, son of 
the great biologist Charles Darwin, the Moon was at one time much 
closer to the Earth than at present. The slow recession of the Moon can 
be explained by the fact that the tidal bulge in the Earth's oceans raised 
by the Moon is carried eastward by the Earth's rotation. This shifts the 
center of gravity of the Earth to the east of the line joining the centers 
of mass of the Earth and Moon and gives the Moon a small acceleration 
in the direction of its orbital motion causing it to speed up and slowly 
spiral outward.

Figure 7.2-2 Lunar orbital elements 
7.2.1 Orbital Elements of the Moon. When viewed from the center 
of the Earth the Moon's orbit can be described by six classical orbital 
elements, for example: 
a-semi-major axis 
e-eccentricity 
i-inclination 
n-Iongitude of the ascending node 
w--argument of perigee 
�-right ascension at epoch 
The fIrst fIve of these elements are defined and discussed in Chapter 
2 and should be familiar to you. The right ascension at epoch is the 
angle measured eastward from the vernal equinox to the projection of 
the Moon's position vector on the equatorial plane. 
In Chapter 2 orbital elements were studied in the context of the 
"restricted 2-body problem" and the elements were found to be 
constants. In the case of the Moon's orbit, due primarily to the 
perturbati ve effect of the Sun, the orbital elements are constantly 

<<<PAGE 340>>>

Sec. 7.2 THE EARTH- MOON SYSTEM 325 
changing with time; their value at any particular time can be obtained 
from a lunar ephemeris such as is published in the American Ephemeris 
and Nautical Almanac. 
We will mention some of the principal perturbations of the Moon's 
motion in order to illustrate its complexity: 
a. The mean value of the semi-major axis is 384,400 km. The average 
time for the Moon to make one complete revolution around the Earth 
relative to the stars is 27.31661 days. Due to solar perturbations the 
sidereal period may vary by as much as 7 hours. 
b. The mean eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is 0.054900489. Small 
periodic changes in the orbital eccentricity occur at intervals of 31.8 
days. This effect, called "evection," was discovered more than 2,000 
years ago by Hipparchus. 
c. The Moon's orbit is inclined to the ecliptic (plane of the Earth's 
orbit) by about 50S'. The line of nodes, which is the intersection of the 
Zt 
vernal equinox 
direction h 
Figure 7.2-3 Rotation of the moon's line of nodes 

<<<PAGE 341>>>

326 LUNAR TRAJECTOR I ES Ch. 7 
Moon's orbital plane with the ecliptic, rotates westward, making one 
complete revolution in lS.6 years. 
The node where the Moon crosses the ecliptic from south to north is 
called the ascending node; the other, where the Moon crosses from 
north to south, is the descending node. Only when the Moon is at one 
of these nodal crossing points carl eclipses occur, for only then can Sun, 
Earth and Moon be suitably aligned. The average time for the Moon to 
go around its orbit from node to (the same) node is 27.21222 days and 
is called the "draconitic period," in reference to the superstition that a 
dragon was supposed to swallow the Sun at a total eclipse. 
d. The inclination of the Moon's orbit to the ecliptic actually varies 
between 40591 and 501SI; its mean value is 5 0S'. The Earth's equator is 
inclined to the ecliptic by 23027', and except for the slow precession of 
the Earth's axis of rotation with a period of 26,000 years, the 
equatorial plane is relatively stationary. 
From Figure 7.2-3 we can see that the angle between the equator and 
the Moon's orbital plane varies because of the rotation of the Moon's 
line of nodes. When the Moon's ascending node coincides with the 
vernal equinox direction, the inclination of the Moon's orbit to the 
equator is a maximum, being the sum of 50S' and 23027' or 2S035'. 
When the descending node is at the vernal equinox, the inclination of the 
Moon's orbit to the equator is the difference, 23°27' - 50S' = lSo19'. 
Thus, the inclination relative to the equator varies between lSol9' and 
2S035' with a period of lS.6 years. 
Both the slight variation in inclination relative to the ecliptic and the 
regression of the line of nodes were first observed by Flamsteed about 
1670. 
e. The line of apsides (line joining perigee and apogee) rotates in the 
direction of the Moon's orbital motion causing w to change by 360° in 
about S.9 years. Newton tried to explain this effect in the Principia but 
his predictions accounted for only about half the observed apsidal 
rotation. In 1749 the French mathematician Clairaut was able to derive 
the correct result from theory, but more than a century later, in lS72, 
the correct calculations were also discovered among Newton's 
unpublished papers: he had detected his own error but had never 
bothered to correct it in print! 
7.2.2 Lunar Librations. The Moon's period of revolution around the 
Earth is exactly equal to its period of rotation on its axis, so it always 
keeps the same face turned toward the Earth. If the Moon's orbit were 

<<<PAGE 342>>>

Sec. 7.3 SIMPLE EARTH-MOON TRAJECTORIES 327 
circular and if its axis of rotation were perpendicular to its orbit, we 
would see exactly half of its surface. 
Actually we see, at one time or another, about 59 percent of the 
lunar surface because of a phenomeno n known as "lunar libration." 
The libration or "rocking motion" of the Moon is due to two causes. 
The geometrical lib ration in latitude occurs because the Moon's equator 
is inclined 6.50 to the plane of its orbit. At one time during the month 
the Moon's north pole is tipped toward the Earth and half a month 
later the south pole is tipped toward us allowing us to see slightly 
beyond each pole in turn. 
The geometrical libration in longitude is due to the eccentricity of 
the orbit. The rotation of the Moon on its axis is uniform but its 
angular velocity around its orbit is not since it moves faster near perigee 
and slower near apogee. This permits us to see about 7.750 around each 
limb of the moon. 
In addition to the apparent rocking motion described above there is 
an actual rocking called "physicallibration" ca,Used by the attraction of 
the Earth on the long diameter of the Moon's triaxial ellipsoid figure. 
7.3 SIMPLE EARTH-MOON TRAJECTORIES 
The computation of a precision lunar trajectory can only be done by 
numerical integration of the equations of motion, taking into account 
the oblate shape of the Earth, solar perturbations, solar pressure, and 
the terminal attraction of the Moon, among other things. Because of 
the complex motions of the Moon, actually mission planning places 
heavy reliance on a lunar ephemeris, which is a tabular listing of the 
Moon's position at regular intervals of chronological time. As a result, 
lunar missions are planned on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day, 
month-by-mo nth basis. 
The general procedure is to assume the initial conditions, ro and vO' 
at the injection point and then use a Runge-Kutta or similar numerica l 
method to determine the subsequent trajectory. Depending on how 
well we select the initial ro and vO' the trajectory may hit the Moon or 
miss it entirely. The idea is to adjust the injection conditions by 
trial-and-error until a suitable lunar impact occurs. 
Even on a high-speed digital computer this procedure can take hours 
of computation time for a single launch date. If we have to explore a 
large number of different launch dates and a variety of injection 
conditions, the computer time required could become prohibitive, and 

<<<PAGE 343>>>

328 LUNAR TRAJECTORIES Ch. 7 
some approximate analytical method is needed to narrow down the 
choice of launch time and injection conditions. 
It is not important that the analytical method be precise, but only 
that it retain the predominant features of the actual problem. With this 
thought in mind, we will look at a few simple Earth-Moon trajectories 
in order to gain some insight into the problem of selecting optimum 
launch dates and approximate injection conditi ons. 
7.3.1 Some Simplifying Assumptions. In order to study the basic 
dynamics of lunar trajectories, we will assume that the Moon's orbit is 
circular with a radius of 384,400 km. Since the mean eccentricity of 
the actual orbit is only about .0549, this will not introduce significant 
errors. We will also assume that we can neglect the terminal attraction 
of the Moon and simply look at some trajectories that intersect the 
Moon's orbit. 
In the analysis which follows we will also assume that the lunar 
trajectory is coplanar with the Moon's orbit. In a precision trajectory 
calculation the launch time is selected so that this is approximately true 
in order to minimize the .6V required for the mission since plane changes 
are expensive in terms of velocity. 
7.3.2 Time-of-Flight Versus Injection Speed. With the assumption 
stated above we can proceed to investigate the effect of injection speed 
on the time-of-flight of a lunar probe. We can compute the energy and 
angular momentum of the trajectory from 2

If we let r = r 0 in this expression, we can solve for va; if we let r equal 
the radius of the Moon's orbit, we can find the true anomaly upon 
arrival at the Moon's orbit. 
We now have enough information to determine the time-of-flight 
from Earth to Moon for any set of injection conditions using the 
equations presented in Chapter 4. 
In Figure 7.3-1 we have plotted time-of-flight vs injection speed for 

<<<PAGE 345>>>

330 LUNAR TRAJECTORIES Ch. 7 
an injection altitude of .05 Earth radii (320 km) and a flight-path angle 
of 00. Actually, the curve is nearly independent of flight-path angle at 
injection. 
We see from this curve that a significant reduction in time-of·flight is 
possible with only modest increases in injection speed. For manned 
missions life-support requirements increase with mission duration so the 
slightly higher injection speed required to achieve a shorter flight time 
pays for itself up to a point. It is interesting to note that the flight time 
chosen for the Apollo lunar landing mission was about 72 hours. 
7.3.3 The Minimum Energy Trajectory. If we assume that injection 
into the lunar trajectory occurs at perigee where <Po = CP, then it is easy 
to see what effect injection speed has on the orbit. In Figure 7.3-2 we 
have shown a family of orbits corresponding to different injection 
speeds. 
For the limiting case where the injection speed is infinite, the path is 
a straight line with a time·of-flight of zero. As we lower the injection 
speed the orbit goes from hyperbolic, to parabolic, to elliptical in shape

Sec. 7.3 SIMPLE EARTH- MOON TRAJECTORIES 331 
and the time-of-flight increases. Eventually, if we keep reducing the 
injection speed, we will arrive at the dashed orbit in Figure 7.3-2 whose 
apogee just barely reaches to the distance of the Moon. Assuming an 
injection altitude of .05 Earth radii (320 km), this minimum injection 
speed is 10.82 km/sec. If we give our lunar probe less than this speed it 
will fail to reach the moon's orbit like the dotted path in Figure 7.3-2. 
The time-of-flight for this minimum energy lunar trajectory is 7,172 
minutes or about 120 hours. Because all other trajectories that reach to 
the Moon's orbit have shorter flight times, this represents an 
approximate maximum time-of-flight for a lunar mission; if we try to 
take longer by going slower,.we will never reach the Moon at all. 
The eccentricity of the minimum energy trajectory is 0.966 and 
represents the minimum eccentricity for an elliptical orbit that reaches 
as far as tht; Moon from our assumed injection point. 
Assuming no lunar gravity , the speed upon arrival at the Moon's orbit 
for the minimum energy trajectory is 0.188 km/sec. This represents the 
slowest approach speed possible for our example. Since the Moon's 
orbital speed is about 1 km/sec, the Moon would literally run into our 
probe from behind, resulting in an impact on the "leading edge" or 
eastern limb of the Moon. Probes which have a higher arrival speed 
would tend to impact somewhere on the side of the Moon facing us. 
From Figure 7.3-2 we see that, as the injection speed is decreased, 
the geocentric angle swept out by the lunar probe from injection to 
lunar intercept increases from 00 to 1800 for the minimum energy case. 
In general the sweep angle, which we can call 1/1, is a function of 
. injection speed for a fixed injection altitude and flight-path angle; an 
increase in sweep angle (up to 1800) corresponds to a decrease in 
injection speed. If we are trying to minimize injection speed, we should 
tty to select an orbit which has a sweep angle of nearly 1800. We will 
make use of this general principal later in this chapter. 
7.3.4 Miss Distance at the Moon Caused by Injection Errors. In 
trying for a direct hit on the Moon we would time our launch so that 
the probe crosses the Moon's orbit just at the instant the Moon is at the 
intercept point. Using our simplified model of the Earth-Moon system 
and neglecting lunar gravity, we can get some idea of how much we will 
miss the center of the Moon if, due to errors in guidance or other 
factors, the injection conditions are not exactly as specified. 
In such a case, both the sweep angle and the time-of-flight will differ 
from their nominal values and the trajectory of the probe will cross the

\ moon \ot ''''''h 
Figure 7.3-3 Effects of launch error may tend to cancel 
Moon's orbit at a different point and time than predicted. In the case of 
a direct (eastward) launch, the effects of such injection errors tend to 
cancel. This may be seen from Figure 7.3-3. 
If, for example, the initial velocity is too high, the geocentric sweep 
angle will be smaller than predicted; that is, the probe will cross the 
Moon's orbit west of the predicted point by some amount 6tj;. But, the 
time-of-flight will be shorter by an amount 6t, so the Moon will be west 
of the predicted intercept point by an amount wrrft, where wm is the 
angular velocity of the Moon in its orbit. Neglecting lunar gravity, the 
angular miss distance along the Moon's orbit is the difference between 
6tj; and wrrft.

Sec. 7.4 THE PATCHED-CONIC APPRO XIMATION : 333 
It is possible to show that for an injection speed of about 11.0 
km/sec, which results in a sweep angle of about 1600, the effects of 
errors in injection altitude and speed exactly cancel' and, for all 
practical purposes, the miss distance at the Moon is a function only of 
errors in the flight-path angle. For this condition an error of 10 in 
flight-path angle produces a miss of about 1,300 km.5 The effect of 
lunar gravity is to reduce this miss distance. 
7.4 THE PATCHED-CONIC APPROXIMATION 
While it is acceptable to neglect lunar gravity if we, only are 
interested in determining ap,proximate injection conditions that result 
in a lunar impact, it is necessary to account for the terminal attrac­
tion of the Moon if we want to predict the lunar arrival conditions 
more exactly .. 
We can take lunar gravity into account and still use 2-body orbital 
mechanics by the simple expedient of considering the probe to be 
under the gravitational influence of the Earth alone until it enters the 
gravitational "sphere of influence" of the Moon and then assuming that 
it moves only under the gravitational influence of the Moon. In effect, 
we pick a point in the vicinity of the Moon where we "turn off the 
Earth and turn on the Moon." Before we show how this is done it 
should be clear to you that what we are about to do is an 
approximation. The transition from geocentric motion to selenocentric 
motion is a gradual process which takes place over a fmite ,arc of the 
trajectory where both Earth and Moon affect the path equally. There is, 
however, evidence to show that this simple strategy of patching two 
conics together at the edge of the Moon's sphere of influence is a 
sufficiently good approximation for preliminary mission analysis.5 
However, the patched-conic analysis is not good for the calculation of 
the return trajectory to the Earth because of errors in the ,encounter 
with the Moon's sphere of influence. It will also be in error for the same 
reason in calculating the perilune altitude and lunar trajectory 
orientation. It is good primarily for outbound delta-v calculations. 
For the analysis which follows we will adopt the definition of sphere 
of influence suggested by Laplace. This is a sphere centered at the 
Moon and having a radius, Rs' given by the expression 
(7.4-1) 

<<<PAGE 349>>>

where D is the distance from the Earth to the Moon. A full derivation 
of equation (7.4-1) can be found in Battin.6 To give at least an 
elementary idea of its origin, consider the equation of motion viewed 
from an Earth frame, (central ,) 
a = acceleration due to earth (perturbing ,) 
+ acceleration due to moon 
Then, the equation of motion viewed from the Moon is (central ) (perturbing ) 
A = acceleration + acceleration 
due to moon due to earth 
The sphere of influence is the approximation resulting from equating 
the ratios 
Equation (7.4-1) yields the value 
Rs = 66,300 km 
or about 1/6 the distance from the Moon to the Earth. 
7.4.1 The Geocentric Departure Orbit. Figure 7.4-1 shows the 
geometry of the geocentric departure orbit. The four quantities that 
completel y specify the geocentric phase are 
where 'Yo is called the "phase angle at departure." 
The difficulty with selecting these four quantities as the independen t

variables is that the determination of the point at which the geocentric 
trajectory crosses the lunar sphere of influence involves an iterative 
procedure in which time-of-flight must be computed during each 
iteration. This difficulty may be by-passed by selecting three initial 
conditions and one arrival condition as the independent variables. A 
particularly convenient set is 
where the angle \ specifies the point at which the geocentric 
trajectory crosses the lunar sphere of influence. 
Given these four quantities we can compute the remaining arrival 
conditions, r1, VI' <PI and 'Y1• We will assume that the geocentric 
trajectory is direct and that lunar arrival occurs prior to apogee of the 
geocentric orbit. The energy and angular momentum of the orbit can be 
determined from 
(7.4-2) 
(7.4-3) 
From the law of cosines, the radius, r1, at lunar arrival is 
(7.4-4) 
. The speed and flight path angle at arrival follow from conservation of 
energy and momentum:

occurs prior to apogee.

The Moon moves through an angle wm (\ -to) between injection

velocity of the Moon in its orbit. Based on our Simplified model of the 
Earth-Moon system, 
Wm = 2.649 X 10-6 rad/sec 
= 2.137 X 10-3 rad/TUEIl 
The phase angle at departure, 'Yo' is then determined from 
(7.4-16) 
Actually, the time-of-flight and phase angle at departure need not be 
computed until we have verified that the values r 0' vo' ct>o and A1, 

<<<PAGE 353>>>

which we chose arbitrarily , result in a satisfactory lunar approach 
trajectory or impact . We will do this in the sections that follow. If the 
lunar trajectory is not satisfactory, then we will adjust the values of r 0' 
vO' ¢o and \ until it is. Only after this trial-and-error procedure is 
complete should we perform the computations embodied in equations 
(7.4-8) through (7.4-16) above. 
Before proceeding to a discussion of the patch condition, a few 
remarks are in order concerning equation (7.4-5). The energy in the 
geocentric departure 0rbit is completely determined by r 0 and vO. The 
geocentric radius, r1, at arrival is completely determined by \ . It may 
happen that the trajectory is not sufficiently energetic to reach the 
specified point on the lunar sphere of influence as determined by \ . If 
so, the quantity under the radical sign in equation (7.4-5) will be 
negative and the whole computationa1 process fails. 
7.4.2 Conditions at the Patch Point. We are now ready to determine 
the trajectory inside the Moon's sphere of influence where only lunar 
gravity is assumed to act on the spacecraft. Since we must now consider 
the Moon as the central body, it is necessary to find the speed and 
direction of the spacecraft relative to the center of the Moon. In Figure 
7.4-2 the geometry of the situation at arrival is shown in detail. 
If we let the subscript 2 indicate the initial conditions relative to the 
Moon's center, then the selena centric radius, r2, is 
(7.4-17) 
The velocity of the spacecraft relative to the center of the Moon is 
where vm is velocity of the Moon relative to the center of the Earth. 
The orbital speed of the Moon for our simplified Earth-Moon model is 
Vm = 1.018 km/sec. (7.4-18) 
The selenocentric arrival speed, v2' may be obtained by applying the 
law of cosines to the vector triangle in Figure 7.4-2:

7.4.3 The Selenocentric Arrival Orbit. The selenocentric initial 
conditions r2, v2 and €2 are now known and so we can compute 
terminal conditions at other points on the trajectory. There are a 

<<<PAGE 355>>>

340 LUNAR TRAJECTORIES Ch. 7 
number of terminal conditions of interest depending on the nature of 
the mission, for example: 
1. Lunar impact, in which case we wish to determine if the 
periselenium radius is less than the radius of the Moon. In case r p. < r m 
we may wish to compute the speed at impact. The radius of the Moon, 
r m may be taken as 1,738 kIn. 
2. Lunar orbit, in which case we may wish to compute the speed 
. increment necessary to produce a circular lunar satellite at the 
periselenium altitude. 
3. Circumluna r flight, in which case we probably would want to 
compute both the periselenium conditions and the conditions upon exit 
from the lunar sphere of influence. 
In any case, the conditions at periselenium will certainly be of 
interest and are probably the best single measure of the trajectory. 
The energy and momentum relative to the center of the Moon are 
given by

trajectory with the following injection conditions:

7.5 NONCOPLANAR LUNAR TRAJECTORIES 
The preceding analysis has been based on the assumption that the 
lunar trajectory lies in the plane of the Moon's orbit. The inclination of 
the Moon's orbit varies between about 18.20 and 28.50 over a period of 
18.6 years. Since it is impossible to launch an Earth satellite into an 
orbit whose inclination is less than the latitude of the launch site (see 
section 2.14-2), a coplanar trajectory originating from Cape Kennedy, 
whose latitude is 28.50, is possible only when the inclination of the 
Moon's orbit is at its maximum value. This occured in the early part of 
1969 and will occur again in 1978. 
Launches which occur at times other than these must necessarily 

<<<PAGE 360>>>

Sec. 7.5 NONC OPLANAR LUNAR TRAJECTORIES 345 
result in non coplanar trajectories. In the sections which follow we will 
examine noncopla nar trajectories and develop a method for selecting 
acceptable launch dates and injection conditions. 
7.5.1 Some Typical Constraints on Lunar Trajectories. If there are 
no restrictions on the launch conditions of a spacecraft or on the 
conditions at lunar approach, then there are no limitations on the time 
of the lunar month at which the spacecraft can approach the Moon. 
Practical considerations, such as launch site' loca tion, missile-range 
safety, accuracy tolerances, and the limited range of attainable injection 
conditions, impose restrictions on the lunar intercept declination which 
can be accommodated. It i� interesting to examine the limitations on 
the possible launch times for lunar missions that are imposed by some 
of these restrictions. 
A typical design restriction for lunar missions is the specification of 
the lighting conditions on the surface of the Moon as determined by the 
phase of the Moon. For a particular year , the declination of the Moon 
at a given phase varies between maximum and minimum values which 
correspond approximately to the mean inclination of the Moon's orbit 
for that year. 
Another typical restriction concerns the permissible directions of 
launch from a particular site. 
In the analysis which follows the launch site is assUmed to be Cape 
Kennedy which has a latitude of 28.50. The launch azimuth, Po' must 
be between 400 and 1150 as specified by Eastern Test Range safety 
requirements. 
7.5.2 Determining the Geocentric Sweep Angle. An important 
parameter in determining acceptable launch times is the total geocentric 
angle swept out by the spacecraft from launch to lunar intercept. The 
total sweep angle I/It' consists of the free-flight sweep angle, I/Iff' from 
injection to intercept plus the geocentric angular travel from launch to 
injection, I/Ic. Depending on the launch technique used, I/Ic may be 
simply the burning arc of the booster for a direct-ascent launch or it 
may be the burning arc plus the angular distance traveled during a 
coasting period prior to injection. 
While the angle I/Ic may be selected arbitrarily, the free-flight sweep 
angle, I/Iff' is determined by the injection conditions r 0' Vo and cpo. The 
angle I/Iff is just the difference in true anomaly between injection and 
lunar intercept and may be computed from the equations in section 
7.3.2. In Figure 7.5-2 we have plotted the free-flight sweep angle for

several values of Vo and ¢o and a fixed injection altitude of 320 km or 
about 200 miles. Lunar intercept is assumed to occur at a distance of 
384,400km. 
By selecting the injection conditions, r 0' Vo and ¢o we can 
determine 1/1ff" If we arbitrarily select 1/1 C' we can obtain the total sweep 
angle from 
(7.5-1) 
Since the latitude or declination of the launch site is known, we may 
determine the declination of the spacecraft after it has traversed an arc 
1/1t if we know the launch azimuth, f30' This is essentially a problem in 
spherical trigonometry and is illustrated in Figure 7.5-3. 
From the law of cosines for spherical triangles, we obtain 
sin 81 = sin 80 cos 1/1t + cos 80 sin 1/1t cos f30 . (7.5-2)

Sec. 7.5 NONCOPLANAR LUNAR TRAJECTORIES 349 
We have plotted values of 01 obtained from equation (7.5-2) versus 
total sweep angle for launch azimuths between 400 and 1150 in Figure 
7.5-4. Since the Moon's declination at intercept is limited between 
+28.50 and -28.50 (during 1969) and because of the range safety 
restrictions on launch azimuth, those portions of the graph that are 
shaded represent impossible launch conditions. 
There are several interesting features of Figure 7.5-4 worth noticing. 
Perhaps the most interesting is the fact that a sweep angle of 1800 is 
possible only if we intercept the Moon at its maximum southern 
declination of -28.50. For this condition any launch azimuth is correct. 
From Figure 7.5-2 we see that free-flight sweep angles of less than 
about 1200 are impossible to achieve without going to very high 
injection speeds or large flight path angles, both of which are 
undesirable. As a result, if we are interested in minimizing injection 
speed, we must intercept the Moon when it is near its maximum 
southern declination for direct-ascent launches or launches where the 
coasting period is small enough to keep t/Jt less than 1800. 
However, if we add a coasting arc, t/J c' large enough to make t/Jt 
greater than 1800, we can intercept the Moon at any point along its 
orbit. 
It should be obvious from equation (7.5-2) and Figure 7.5-4 that 
launch azimuth and lunar declination at intercept are not independent ; 
once t/Jt is known selecting either launch azimuth or declination at 
intercept determines the other uniquely. If lunar declination at 
intercept is specified, then launch azimuth may be read directly from 
Figure 7.5-4 or computed more accurately from 
sir! 01 -sir! 00 cos t/Jt cos {3 = - ---=-� --:-- --- o cos 00 sir! t/Jt (7.5-3) 
7.5.3 Selecting an Acceptable Launch Date. Once the lunar 
declination at intercept is determined the next step is to search through 
a lunar ephemeris to find a time when the Moon is at the correct 
declinatio n. If lighting conditions are important , we must find a time 
when both declination and phase are simultaneously correct. The 
American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac (AE) lists the right 
ascension and declination of the Moon for every hour as well as the 
phases of the Moon. Figure 7.5 -5 shows a typical page portion from 
a lunar epheme ris.

Sec. 7.5 NONCOPLANAR LUNAR TRAJECTORIES 351 
Suppose we now select a time, \' for lunar intercept that meets the 
declination and lighting constraints. The right ascension of the moon at 
t1 should be noted from theAE. This is the angle a1 in Figure 7.5-3. 
The difference in right ascension, !::lX, between launch and intercept 
is fixed by the geometry of Figure 7.5-3. Applying the law of cosines to 
the spherical triangle in Figure 7.5-3, we get 
cos 6a. = cos 1/1t -sin 00 sin 0 1 
cos 00 cos 01 (7.5-4) 
The next step is to establish the exact time of launch, to' and the 
right ascension of the launch site, ao' at this launch time. To establish 
to we need to compute the total time from launch to intercept. This 
consists of the free-flight time from injection to intercept, which may 
be computed from the injection conditions, plus the time to traverse 
the burning and coasting arc, 1/1c' Thus, the total time, tt' is 
(7.5-5) 
where tft is the free-flight time and tc is the burn-plus-coast time. 
The launch time, to' can now be obtained from 
(7.5-6) 
The right ascension of the launch point, �, is the same as the "local 
sidereal time," 8, at the launch point (see Figure 2.8-4), and may be 
obtained from equation (2.8-9): 
a = 8 = 8 + AE o 9 (7.5-7) 
where AE is the east longitude of the launch site and 8g is the 
G�eenwich Sidereal Time at to' Values of 8 
Q are tabulated in the AE for 
o UT on every day of the year and may oe obtained by interpolation 
for any hour or by the method outlined in section 2.9. 
It would be sheer coincidence if the difference a1 -ao were the same 
as the!::lX calculated from equation (7.5-4). Since the right ascension of 
the Moon changes very slowly whereas the right ascension of the launch 
point changes by nearly 3600 in a day, it is possible to adjusttl, slightly 

<<<PAGE 367>>>

352 LUNAR TRAJECTOI;tIES Ch. 7 
and recompute to and Qb until (Xl - (Xo and the required f::Dl from 
equation (7.5-4) agree. The lunar declination at intercept will change 
very slightly as tl is adjusted and it may be necessary to go back to 
equation (7.5-3) and redetermine the launch azimuth, � . 
We now know the injection condition s, r 0' vo' CPo' 30 and the exact 
day and hour of launch and lunar intercept that will satisfy all of the 
constraints set forth earlier. These launch conditions should provide us 
with sufficiently accurate initial conditions to begin the computation of 
a precision lunar trajectory using numerical methods. 
EXERCISES 
7.1 Calculate the burnout velocity required to transfer a probe 
between the vicinity of the Earth (assume rbo = 1 DU) and the Moon's 
orbit using a Hohmann transfer. What additional 6.V would be required 
to place the probe in the same orbit as that of the Moon. Neglect the 
Moon's gravity in both parts. 
7.2 For a lunar vehicle which is injected at perigee near the surface 
of the Earth, determine the eccentricity of the trajectory that just 
reaches the sphere of influence of the Moon. 
7.3 For a value of € = + 2r:P determine the maximum value of V 
which will allow lunar impact. 2 
7.4 The following quantities are with respect to the Moon:

VI = 1 km/sec 
�m = 0.426 km2/sec2 
Determine A of perilune. hm = 33,084 km2 /sec

Ch. 7 EXERCISES 353 
7.S It is desired that a lunar vehicle have its perilune 262 km above 
the lunar surface with direct motion about the Moon. 
a. At the sphere of influence v2 = 500 m/sec. Calculate the initial 
value of €2 which must exist to satisfy the conditions. 
b. Determine the /:;.v necessary to place the probe in a circular 
orbit in which perilune is an altitude of 262 krn. 
7.6 A space probe was sent to investigate the planet Mars. On the 
way it crosses the Moon's orbit. The burnout conditions are: 
rbo = 7972 km 
Vbo = 1600 m/sec 
For vmoon = 1024 m/sec and D = 384,400 km: 
a. What is the speed of the probe as it is at the distance D from 
the Earth? 
b. What is the elevation angle of the probe at D? 
c. What is the angle through which the Moon will have moved 30 
hours after launch of the probe? 
7.7 A lunar vehicle arrives at the sphere of influence of the Moon 
with A.I = 00• The speed of the vehicle relative to the Earth is 200 
m/sec and the flight-path angle relative to the Earth is 80°. The vehicle 
is in direct motion relative to the Earth. Find v2 relative to the Moon 
and €2' Is the vehicle in retrograde or direct motion relative to the 
Moon? 
7.8 Given a lunar declination at intercept of 150 and a total 
geocentric sweep angle of 1500 find the launch azimuth. Is this an 
acceptable launch azimuth? 
7.9 A sounding rocket is fired vertically from the surface of the 
Earth so that its maximum altitude occurs at the distance of the Moon's 
orbit. Determine the velocity of the sounding rocket at apogee relative 
to the Moon (neglecting Moon gravity) if the Moon were nearby.

7.10 Discuss the change in energy with respect to the Earth due to 
passing by the Moon in front or behind the Moon's orbit (retrograde or 
direct orbit with respect to the Moon). Which would be best for a lunar 
landing? 
7.11 Design a computer program which will solve the basic patched 
conic lunar transfer problem. Specifically, given that you wish to arrive 
at perilune at a specified altitude, select ro' vo' <1>0 to meet this 
. requirement . One approach is to select a reasonable r 0' vo' CPo and 
iterate on Ai until the lunar orbit conditions are met. A suggested set of 
data is hbo = 200 km, CPo = 00 and vary the Vo to show the effect of 
insufficient energy to reach the Moon. Choose a reasonable value of 
maximum available velocity (of which Vo is a part) and consider having 
enough velocity remaining at perilune to inject the probe into a circular 
lunar orbit at perilune altitude. 
* 7 .12 A "free-return" lunar trajectory is one which passes around the 
Moon in such a manner that it will return to the Earth with no 
additional power to change its orbit-Determine such an orbit using the 
patched conic method. Find the vbo' CPbo and 'Yo such that the return 
trajectory will havehp3rigee= 50 n mi and thus insure re-entry. Use hbo 
= lOO n mi. Attempt to have a perilune altitude of about 100 n mi. 
(Hint: Use a computer and don't expect an exact solution. There are 
several orbits that may meet the criteria. You will have to extend the 
iterative technique of this chapter.) 
*7.13 To show that the calculations in problem 7.12 cannot really be 
used in practice, vary vbo' rbo and CPbo by some small amount (. 1 
percent) to find the sensitivity of perilune distance and return 
trajectory perigee to the burnout parameters. Then make some 
estimates as to how inaccurate the patched-conic approximation is and 
discuss how great the real-world or act ual errors would be (use the 
sensitivity calculations as a basis for the discussion).

CHAPTER 8 
INTERPLANETARY TRAJECTORIES 
There are seven windows in the head, two nostrils, two 
eyes, two ears, and a mouth; so in the heavens there are two 
favorable stars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and 
Mercury alone undecided and indifferent. From which and 
many other similar phenomena of nature, such as the seven 
metals, etc., which it were tedious to enumerate, we gather 
that the number of planets is neces sarily seven. 
-Francesco Sizzi 
(argument against Galileo's 
discovery of the satellites of 
Jupiter)} 
8.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
The word "planet" means "wanderer." That the naked-eye planets 
wander among the stars was one of the earliest astronomical 
observations. At first it was not understood. The ancient Greeks 
gradually saw its significance; indeed, Aristarchu s of Samos realized 
that the planets must revolve around the Sun as the central body of the 
solar system. But the tide of opinion ebbed, and an Earth-centered 
system held the field until Copernicus rediscovered the heliocent ric 
system in the 16th century. 
Copernicus, who was born in Polish Prussia in 1473, compiled tables 
of the planetary motions that remained useful until superceded by the 
more accurate measurements of Tycho Brahe. By 1507 he was 
357 

<<<PAGE 373>>>

358 INTERPL ANETARY TRAJECTORIES Ch.8 
convinced that the planets revolved around the Sun and in 1530 he 
wrote a treatise setting forth his revolutionary concept. It is not well 
known that this work was dedicated to Pope Paul III and that a cardinal 
paid for the printing; indeed, during the lifetime of Copernicus his work 
received the approval of the Church. Not until 1616 was it declared 
"false, and altogether opposed to Holy Scripture," in spite of the fact 
that Kepler published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609. 
Such was the atmosphere of the Dark Ages that even the telescopic 
. observations of Galileo in 1610 failed to change the Church's position. 
Galileo's data seemed to point decisively to the heliocentric 
hypothesis: the moons of Jupiter were a solar system in miniature. 
Galileo's books which set forth cogent and unanswerable astronomical 
arguments in favor of the Copernican theory were suppressed and 
Galileo himself, at the age of 70, was forced by the Inquisition to 
renounce what he knew to be true. After swearing that the Earth was 
"fixed" at the center of the solar system he is said to have murmured 
under his breath "it does move, neverthele ss." 
The publication of Newton's Principia in 1687 laid to rest forever 
the Earth-centered concept of the solar system. With Newton the 
process of formulating and understanding the motions within the solar 
system was brought to completion. 
8.2 THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
The Sun is attended by an enormous number of lesser bodies, the 
members of the solar system. Most conspicuous are the nine 
planets-Merc ury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, 
Neptune, and Pluto. Between Mars and Jupiter circulate the minor 
planets, or asteroids which vary in size from a few hundred miles to a 
few feet in. diameter. In addition, comets, some of which pass near the 
Sun, are spread much more widely throughout the system. 
8.2.1 Bode's Law. The mean distances of the principal planets from 
the Sun show a simple relationship which is known as Bode's Law after 
the man who formulated it in 1772. If we write down the series 0, 3, 6, 
12 ... , add 4 to each number and divide by 10, the numbers thus 
obtained represent the mean distances of the planets from the Sun in 
Astronom ical Units (AU). An Astronomical Unit is the mean distance 
from the Sun to the Earth. The "law," as may be seen in Table 8.2-1, 
predicts fairly well the distances of all the planets except Neptune and 
Pluto.

Whether Bode's Law is an empirical accident or is somehow related 
to the origin and evolution of the solar system by physical laws is a 
question which remains unanswered. 
8.2.2 Orbital Elements and Physical Constants. Except for Mercury 
and Pluto, the orbits of the planets are nearly circular and lie nearly in 
the plane of the ecliptic. Pluto's orbit is so eccentric that the perihelion 
point lies inside the orbit of Neptune; this suggests that Pluto may be 
an escaped satellite of Neptune. 
The size, shape and orientation of the planetary orbits is described 
by five classical orbital elements which remain relatively fixed except 
for slight perturbations caused by the mutual attraction of the planets. 
The sixth orbital element, which defines the position of the planet in its 
orbit, changes rapidly with time and may be obtained for any date from 
the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. A complete set of 
orbital elements for the epoch 1969 June 28.0 is presented in Table 
8.2-2. 
Table 8.2-3 summarizes some of the important physical character­
istics of the planets.

362 INTERPL ANETARY TRAJECTORIES Ch. S 
shaped by the gravitational field of the departure or arrival planet. The 
perturbations caused by the other planets while the spacecraft is 
pursuing its heliocentric course are negligible. 
Just as in lunar trajectories, the computation of a precision orbit is a 
trial-and-error procedure involving numerical integration of the 
complete equations of motion where all per�urbation effects are 
considered. For preliminary mission analysis and feasibility studies it is 
sufficient to have an approximate analytical method for determining 
. the total !::N required to accomplish an interplanetary mission. The best 
method available for such an analysis is called the patched-conic 
approximation and was introduced in Chapter 7. 
The patched-conic method permits us to ignore the gravitational 
influence of the Sun until the spacecraft is a great distance from the 
Earth (perhaps a million kilometers). At this point its speed relative to 
the Earth is very nearly the "hyperbolic excess speed" referred to in 
Chapter 1. If we now switch to a heliocentric frame of reference, we 
can determine both the velocity of the spacecraft relative to the Sun 
and the subsequent heliocentric orbit. The same procedure is followed 
in reverse upon arrival at the target planet's sphere of influence. 
The first step in designing a successful interplanetary trajectory is to 
select the heliocentric transfer orbit that takes the spacecraft from the 
sphere of influence of the departure planet to the sphere of influence of 
the arrival planet. 
8.3.1 The Heliocentric Transfer Orbit. For transfers to most of the 
planets, we may consider that the planetary orbits are both circular and 
coplanar. In Chapter 3 we discussed the problem of transferring 
between coplanar circular orbits and found that the most economical 
method, from the standpoint of /:,v required, was the Hohmann 
transfer. A Hohmann transfer between Earth and Mars is pictured in 
Figure 8.3-l. 
While it is always desirable that the transfer orbit be tangential to 
the Earth's orbit at departure, it may be preferrable to intercept Mars' 
orbit prior to apogee, especially if the spacecraft is to return to Earth. 
The Hohmann transfer, if continued past the destination planet, would 
not provide a suitable return trajectory. For a one-way trip this is 
irrelevent ; however, for a probe which is to be recovered or for a 
manned mission, this consideration is important. The outbound trip to 
Mars on the Hohmann trajectory consumes between 8 and 9 months. If 
the spacecraft continued its flight it would return to the original point

for nearly 6 months or the original trajectory must be modifip.d so that 
the spacecraft will encounter the Earth at the point where it recrosses 
the earth's orbit. 
Neverthe less, the Hohmann transfer provides us with a convenient 
yardstick for determining the minimum /::;.v required for an 
interplane tary mission. The energy of the Hohmann transfer orbit is 
given by

364 INTERPL ANETARY TRAJECTORIES Ch. B 
(8.3-1) 
where f.l0 is the gravitational parameter of the Sun, r 1 is the radius of 
the departure planet's orbit, and r2 is the radius of the arrival planet's 
orbit. 
The heliocentric speed, VI' required at the departure point is 
obtained from 
(8.3-2) 
The time-of-flight on the Hohmailn transfer is just half the period of 
the transfer orbit since departure occurs at perihelion and arrival occurs 
at aphelion. If tl is the time when the spacecraft departs and t2 is the 
arrival time, then, for the Hohmann transfer, 
tt �w j} 2 1 f.l0 
=1f (r + r )3 1 2 (8.3-3) 
In Table 8.3-1 we have listed the heliocentric speed required at 
departure and the time-of-flight for Hohmann transfers to all of the 
principal planets of the solar system. 
The orbital speed of the Earth is 1 AU0'TU0 or 29.78 kIn/sec. 
From Table 8.3-1 it is obvious that transfers to the inner planets require 
that the spacecraft be launched in the direction opposite the Earth's 
orbital motion so as to cancel some of the Earth's orbital velocity; 
transfers to the outer planets require that the spacecraft depart the 
Earth parallel to the Earth's orbital velocity. 
In any case, the difference between the heliocentric speed, VI' and 
the Earth's orbital speed represents the speed of the space craft relative 
to the Earth at departure which we will call /:"V1 • 
The method for computing /:"v1 for other than Hohmann transfers is 
presented in section 3.3.3 and should be reviewed.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM. Calculate the heliocentric departure speed 
and time of flight for a Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars. Assume 
both planets are in circular coplanar orbits. Neglect the phasing 
requirements due to their relative positions at the time of transfer. 
From Table 8.2-2 the radius to Mars from the Sun, r d> and the radius 
to Earth from the Sun, r E9> are respectively: . 
rd = 1.524 AU 
From equation (8.3-1) the energy of the Hohmann transfer trajectory 
is: 

<<<PAGE 381>>>

366 INTERPL ANETARY TRAJECTORIES Ch. 8 
From equation (8.3-2) the heliocentric speed, vl' required at the 
departure point is: 
= 1.099AU/TU0 
= 32.73Km/sec . 
From equation (8.3.-3) the time-of-flight from Earth to Mars for the 
Hohmann transfer is 
J!3 t -t =1T _t_=rr 21 11 
1'""0 
= 4.4538 TUG = .7088 years = 258.9 days 
8.3.2 Phase Angle at Departure. If the spacecraft is to encounter the 
target planet at the time it crosses the planet's orbit then obviously the 
Earth and the target planet must have the correct angular relationship 
at departure. The angle between the radius vectors to the departure and 
arrival planets is called 'Y1, the phase angle at departure, and is 
illustrated in Figure 8.3-2 for a Mars trajectory. 
The total sweep angle from departure to arrival is just the difference 
in true anomaly at the two points, v2 - VI' which may be determined 
from the polar equation of a conic once p and e of the heliocentric 
transfer orbit have been selected. 
p -r cosv = __ 2 2 er 2 (8.3-4) 
p -r cos V = __ 1 (8.3-5) 1 er 1 
The time-of-flight may be determined from the Kepler equation 
which was derived in Chapter 4. The target planet will move through an 
angle wt(t2 -t1) while the spacecraft is in flight, where wt is the 
angular velocity of the target planet. Thus, the correct phase angle at 
departure is

severely limits the times when a launch may take place. The 
heliocentric longitudes of the planets are tabulated in the American 
Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, pp 160-176, and these may be used 
to determine when the phase angle will be correct. The heliocentric 
longitude of the Earth may be obtained from pp 20-33 of the AE by 
adding 1800 to the tabulated geocentric longitudes of the Sun. 
If we miss a particular launch opportunity, how long will we have to 
wait until the correct phase angle repeats itself? The answer to this 
question depends on the "synodic period" between the Earth and the 
particular target planet. Synodic period is defined as the time required 
for any phase angle to repeat itself.

advance of one will exceed that of the other by 21T radians and the 
original phase angle will be repeated, so 
WEfJ7s -Wt7s = ± 21T 
21T 7 = (8.3-7) s I wEfJ - wt I 
The synodic periods of all the planets relative to Earth are given in 
Table 8.3·2. 
It is clear that for the two planets nearest the Earth, Mars and 
Venus, the times between the reoccurence of a particular phase angle is 
quite long. Thus; if a Mars or Venus launch is postponed, we must 
either compute a new trajectory or wait a long time for the same launch 
conditions 'to occur again. 
8.3.3 Escape From the Earth's Sphere of Influence. Once the 
heliocentric transfer orbit has been selected and /:::;v1 determined, we 
can proceed to establish the injection or launch conditions near the 
surface of the Earth which will result in the required hyperbolic excess 
speed. Since the Earth's sphere of influence has a radius of about 106 
km, we assume that

Solving for vo' we get 
(8.3-10) 
The hyperbolic excess speed is extremely sensitive to small errors in 

<<<PAGE 385>>>

370 INTER PLANETARY TRAJECTORIES Ch. 8 
the injection speed. This may be seen by solving equation (8.3-9) for v! 
and taking the differential of both sides of the resulting equation 
assuming that r 0 is constant: 
The relative error in v"" may be expressed as 
(8.3-11) 
For a Hohmann transfer to Mars, v"" = 2.98 km/sec and Vo = 11.6 
km/sec, so equation (8.3-11) becomes 
which says that a 1 percent error in injection speed results in a 15.2 
percent error in hyperbolic excess speed. 
For transfer to one of the outer planets, the hyperbolic excess 
velocity should be parallel to the Earth's orbital velocity as shown in 
Figure 8.3-3. Assuming that injection occurs at perigee of the departure 
hyperbola, the angle, fI, between the Earth's orbital velocity vector and 
the injection radius vector may be determined from the geometry of 
the hyperbola. 
From Figure 8.3-4 we see that the angie, fI, is given by 
cos fI = -§. C

It should be noted at this point that it is not necessary that the 
geocentric departure orbit lie in the plane of the ecliptic but only that 
the hyperbolic departure asymptote be parallel to the Earth's orbital 
velocity vector. 
The locus of possible injection points forms a circle on the surface of 
the Earth. When the launch site rotates through this circle launch may 
occur. 
8.3.4 Arrival at the Target Planet. Generally, the heliocentri c 
transfer orbit will be tangent to the Earth's orbit at departure in order 
to take full advantage of the Earth's orbital velocity. At arrival, 
however, the heliocentric transfer orbit usually crosses the target 
planet's orbit at some angle, cfJ2' as shown in Figure 8.3-6. 
If &t and hr are the energy and angular momentum of the 
heliocent ric transfer orbit, then v2 and cfJ2 may be determined from

3 (8.3-19) 
If a dead-center hit on the target planet is planned then the phase 
angle at departure, 'Yl ' should be selected from equation (8.3-6). This 
ensures that the target planet will be at the intercept point at the same 
time the spacecraft is there. It also means that the relative velocity 
vector, v3' upon arrival at the target planet's sphere of influence, will be 
directed toward the center of the planet, resulting in a straight line 
hyperbolic approach trajectory. 
If it is desired to fly by the target planet instead of impacting it, then 
the phase angle at departure must be modified so that the spacecraft 
crosses the target planet's orbit ahead of or behind the planet. If the 
miss distance along the orbit is called x then the phase angle at 
departure should be 
(8.3-20) 
where the plus or minus sign is chosen depending on whether the 
spacecraft is to cross ahead of (-) or behind (+) the target planet. 
If the spacecraft crosses the planet's orbit a distance x ahead of the 
planet, then the vector v3' which represents the hyperbolic excess 
velocity on the approach hyperbola, is offset a distance y from the 
center of the target planet as shown in Figure 8.3-7. 
From Figure 8.3-7 we see that 
y = x sin e (8.3-21) 
Once the offset distance is known, the distance of closest approach 
or periapsis radius may be computed.

hyperbolic approach trajectory is shown, where V3 is the hyperbolic 
excess velocity upon entrance to the target planet's sphere of influence

and solving for vp and substituting it into equation (8.3-28) we 'get 
(8.3-29) 
It is interesting to see what offset distance results in a periapsis 
radius equal to the radius of the target planet, r t This particular offset 
distance is called b, the "inwact parameter," since any offset less than 
this will result in a collision. In this connection it is convenient to assign 
to the target planet an impact size which is larger than its physical size. 
This concept is also employed by atomic and nuclear physicists and is 
called "effective collision cross section." The radius of the effective 
collision cross section is just the impact parameter, b. 
We can determine the impact parameter by setting r p = rt in 
equation (8.3-29). 
2 2fJ.t V +--3 r t (8.3-30) 
The effective cross section of the planet represents a rather large 
target as shown in Figure 8.3-9. If we wish to take advantage of 
atmospheric braking, then a much smaller target must be considered; 
only a thin annulus of radius b and width db. The cross section for 
hitting the atmosphere of the target planet is called the "re-entry 
corridor" and may be very small indeed.

Up to now we have assumed that the planetary orbits an1ie in the 
plane of the ecliptic. From Table 8.2-2 it may be seen that some of the 
planetary orbits are inclined several degrees to the ecliptic. Fimple4 has 
shown that a good procedure to use when the target planet lies above or 
below the ecliptic plane at intercept is to launch the spacecraft into a 
transfer orbit which lies in the ecliptic plane and then make a simple 
plane change during mid-course when the true anomaly change 
remaining to intercept is 900. This minimizes the magnitude of the 
plane change required and is illustrated in Figure 8.4-1.

PERTURBATIONS 
"Life itself is a perturbation of the norm." 
"An unperturbed existence leads to dullness of spirit and 
mind." 
"To cause a planet or other celestial body to deviate from a 
theoretically regular orbital motion." -Webster 
9.1 INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
A perturbation is a deviation from some normal or expected motion. 
Macroscopically, one tends to view the universe as a highly regular and 
predictable scheme of motion. Yet when it is analyzed from accurate 
observational data, it is found that there seem to be distinct, and at 
times unexplainab le, irregularit ies of motion superimp osed upon the 
average or mean movement of the celestial bodies. After working in 
great detail in this text with many aspects of the two-body problem, it 
may come as somewhat of a shock to realize that real-world trajectory 
problems cannot be solved accurately with the restricted two-body theory 
presented. The actual path will vary from the theoretical two-body path 
due to perturbations caused by other mass bodies (such as the Moon) 
and additional forces not considered in Keplerian motion (such as 
nonspherical Earth). 
We are very familiar with perturbations in almost every area of life. 
Seldom does anything go exactly as planned, but is perturbed by 
various unpredictable circumstan ces. There is always some variation 
385 

<<<PAGE 401>>>

386 PERTURB ATIONS Ch. 9 
from the norm. An excellent example is an aircraft encounter ing a wind 
gust. The power and all directional controls are kept constant, yet the 
path may change abruptly from the theoretical. The wind gust was a 
perturbation. Fortunately , most of the perturbations we will need to 
consider in orbital flight are much more predictable and analytically 
tractable than the above example. Those which are unpredictable (wind 
gusts, meteoroid collisions, etc.) must be treated in a stochastic 
(probabilistic) manner. Some of the perturbations which could be 
considered are due to the presence of other attracting bodies, 
atmospheric drag and lift, the asphericity of the Earth or Moon, solar 
radiation effects, magnetic, and relativistic effects. Analytic formula­
tions of some of these will be given in section 9.6. 
It should not be supposed that perturbations are always small, for 
they can be as large as or larger than the primary attracting force. In 
fact, many interplanetary missions would miss their target entirely if 
the perturbing effect of other attracting bodies were not taken into 
account. Ignoring the effect of the oblateness of the Earth on an 
artificial satellite would cause us to completely fail in the predictio n of 
its position over a long period of time. Without the use of perturbation 
methods of analysis it would be impossible to explain or predict the 
orbit of the Moon. Following are some specific examples of the past 
value of perturbation analysis. Newton had explained most of the 
variations in the Moon's orbit, except the motion of the perigee. In 
1749 Clairant found that the second-order perturbation terms removed 
discrepancies between the observed and theoretical values, which had 
not been treated by Newton. Then, about a century later, the full 
explanation was found in an unpublished manuscript of Newton's. E. 
M. Brown's papers of 1897-1908 explain in great detail the perturbative 
effects of the oblateness of the Earth and Moon on the Moon's orbit 
and the effect of other plane ts. The presence of the planet Neptune was 
deduced analytically by Adams and by Leverrier from analysis of the 
perturbed motion of Uranus. The fIrst accurate prediction of the return 
of Halley's Comet in 1759 by Clairant was made from calculation of 
the perturbations due to Jupiter and Saturn. He correctly predicted a 
possible error of 1 month due to mass uncertainty and other more 
distant planets. The shape of the Earth was deduced by an analysis of 
long-perio d perturbation terms in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. 
These are but a few of the examples of application of perturbation 
analysis. Note that these were studies of bodies over which we have no

control. With the capability for orbital flight, knowledge of how to 
handle perturbations is a necessary skill for applying astrodynamics to 
real-world problems of getting from one place (or planet) to another. 
This chapter is a first step to reality from the simplified theoretical 
foundation laid earlier in this text. 
There are two main categories of perturbation techniques. These are 
referred to as special perturbati ons and general (or absolute) 
perturbati ons. Special perturbations are techniques which deal with the 
direct numerical integration of the equations of motion including all 
necessary perturbing accelerations. This is the main emphasis of this 
chapter. General perturbation techniques involve an analytic integration 
of series expansions of the perturbing accelerations. This is a more 
difficult and lengthy technique than special perturbation techniques, 
but it leads to better understanding of the source of the perturbation. 
Most of the discoveries of the preceding paragraph are due to general 
perturbation studies. 
The objective of this chapter is to present some of the more useful 
and well-known special perturbation techniques in such a way that the 
reader can determine when and how to apply them to a specific 
problem. In particular, the Cowell, Encke, and variation of elements 
techniques are discussed. Since numerical integration is necessary in 
many uses, asectiondiscussingmethods and errors is included. Analytical 
formulation of some of the more common perturbation accelerations is 
included to aid application to specific problems . A list of classical and 
current works on perturbations and integration techniques will be 
included at the end of the chapter for the reader who wishes to study 
perturbation analysis in greater depth. See section 1.2 for a table 
showing relative perturbation accelerations on a typical Earth satellite. 
9.2 COWELL'S METHOD 
This is the simplest and most straight forward of all the perturbation 
methods. It was developed by P. H. Cowell in the early 20th century 
and was used to determine the orbit of the eighth satellite of Jupiter. 
Cowell and Crommelin also used it to predict the return of Halley's 
Comet for the period 1759 to 1910. This method has been 
"rediscovered" many times in many forms. It is especially popular and 
useful now with faster and larger capacity computers becoming 
common. 
The application of Cowell's method is simply to write the equations

and then to integrate them step-by-st ep numerically . For the two-body

Having the analytical formulation of the perturbation, the state (r and 
v) at any time can be found by applying one of the many available 
numerical integration schemes to equations (9.2-3). 
The main advantage of Cowell's method is the simplicity of 
formulation and implementation. Any number of perturbations can 
be handled at the same time. Intuitively , one would suspect that no 
method so simple would also be free of shortcomin gs, and he would 
be correct. There are some disadvantages of the method. When motion 
is near a large attracting body, smaller integration steps must be 
taken which severely affect time and accumulative error due to 
roundoff. This method is approximately 10 times slower than Enc ke's 
method. It has been found that Cowell's method is not the best for 
lunar trajectories. Even in double precision computer arithmetic, 
roundoff error will soon take its toll in interplanetary flight 
calculations if step size is small. 
Classically, Cowell's method has been applied in a Cartesian 
coordinate system as shown in equations (9.2-2). Some improvement 
can be made in trajectory problems by formulating the problem in 
polar or spherical coordinates. In this case the r will tend to vary 
slowly and the angle change often will be monotonic. This will often permit 
larger integration step sizes for the same truncation error. In spherical 
coordinates (r, 8, ¢) the equations of motion are (for an equatorial 
coordinate system):

9.3 ENCKE'S METHOD 
Though the method of Encke is more complex than that of 
Cowell, it appeared over half a century earlier in 1857. Bond had 
actually suggested it in 1849-2 years before Encke's work became 
known. 
In the Cowell method the sum of all accelerations was integrated 
together. In the Encke method, the difference between the primary 
acceleration and all perturbing accelerations is integrated. This implies

a reference orbit along which the object would move in the absence of 
all perturbing accelerations. Presumably , this reference orbit would be a 
conic section in an ideal Newtonian gravitational field. Thus all 
calculations and states (position and velocity) would be with respect to 
the reference trajectory. In most works the reference trajectory is called 
the osculating orbit. "Osculation" is the "scientific" term for kissing. 
The term connotes the sense of contact, and, in our case, contact 
between the reference (or osculating) orbit and the true perturbed 

<<<PAGE 406>>>

Sec. 9.3 ENCKE 'S METHOD 391 
orbit. The osculating orbit is the orbit that would result if all perturbing 
accelerations could be removed at a particular time (epoch). At that 
time, or epoch, the osculating and true orbits are in contact or coincide 
(see Figure 9.3-1). 
Any particular osculating orbit is good until the true orbit deviates 
too far from it. Then a process called rectification must occur to 
continue the integration. This simply means that a new epoch and 
starting point will be chosen which coincide with the true orbital path. 
Then a new osculating orbit is calculated from the true radius and 
velocity vectors, neglecting the perturbations (see Figure 9.3-1). 
Now we will consider th,e analytic formulation of Encke's method. 
The basic objective is to find an analytic expression for the difference 
between the true and reference orbits. Let rand p be the radius vectors 
to, respectively, the true (perturbed) and osculating (reference) orbits 
at a particular time 7 (7 = t -to)' Then for the true orbit, 
r + � r = a r3 p 
and for the osculating orbit, 
Note that at the epoch, to = 0, 
r(to) = p(tb) and v(to) == p(to) (9.3-1) 
(9.3-2) 
Let the deviation from the reference orbit, Sr, be defined as (see Figure 
9.3-2) 
Sr = r -p 
.. .. 
and Sr = r -p 
Substituting equations (9.3-1) and (9.3-2) into (9.3-3) we obtain (9.3-3)

This is the desired differential equation for the deviation, 6r. For a 
given set of initial conditions, 6r (to + .6.t) can be calculated 
numerically . p is a known function of time, so r can be obtained from 
6r and p. So, theoretically, we should be able to calculate the perturbed 
position and velocity of the object. However, one of the reasons for 
going to this method from Cowell's method- was to obtain more 
3 
accuracy , but the term (1 -�) is the difference of two very nearly r 
equal quantities which requires many extra digits of computer accuracy 
on that one operation to maintain reasonable accuracy throughout. A 
standard method of treating the difference of nearly equal quantities is 
to define

r2 _ p2 -1 -2q 
So 
q = -*2 [<5X(PX+%<5X) + <5Y(Py+%<5y) + <5z(pz+%<5z)](9.3-8) 
Now, at any point where pand <5r are known we can calculate q, but as 
was noted before the same problem of small differences still exists in 
equation (9.3-7). There are two methods of solution at this point. The 
first is to expand the term (1 -2q)-3 /2 in a binomial series to get 
1 -(1 -2qr3/2= 3q _ 3·5 q2 + 3·5·7 q3 _ ... 
2! 3! (9.3-9) 
Before the advent of high speed digital computers this was a very 
cumbersome task, so the second method was to define a function f as 
f = 1 [1 -(1 -2q r3 /2] 
q 
Then equation (9.3-7) becomes (9.3-10) 
(9.3-11) 
Tables of f vs q have been constructed (see Planetary Coordinates, 
1960)1 to avoid hand calculation. It should also be noted that when the 
deviation from the reference orbit is small (which should be the case 
most of the time) the /)x2, /)y2, <5z2 term can be neglected in equation 
(9.3-8) and 
(9.3-12) 

<<<PAGE 410>>>

Sec. 9.3 ENCKE'S METHOD 395 
which is easily calculated. Then the tables could be used to find f. The 
method using equation (9.3-9) is recommended for use with the 
computer, although the use of equation (9.3-12) may be slightly faster. 
If equation (9.3-12) is used, care must be taken to see when the 
approximation is not valid. 
The Encke formulation reduces the number of integration steps 
since the (jr presumably changes mbre slowly than r, so larger step sizes 
can be taken. The advantages of the method diminish if (1) ap becomes 
Il (jr much larger than -3 (fqr -5r) or (2)-does not remain quite small. In p p 
the case of (1) it may be that the reference parameters (or orbit) need 
to be changed since the perturbations are becoming prima ry. In the case 
of (2) a new osculating orbit needs to be chosen using the values of r 
(jr 
and v as described earlier. Rectification should be initiated when -is p 
greater than or equal to some small constant (of the reader's selection 
depending on the accuracy and speed of the computing machinery 
used, but of the order of magnitude of 0.01). 
Encke's method is generally much faster than Cowell's due to the 
ability to take larger integration step sizes when near a large attr acting 
body. It will be about 10 times faster for interplane tary orbits, but only 
about 3 times faster for Earth satellites (see Baker, Vol 2, p 229).2 
A computational algorithm for Encke's method can be outlined as 
follows; 
a. Given the initial conditions r(to) = p(to)' 'v(to) = iJ(to) defme the 
osculating orbit. (jr = 0, and 5r = 0 at this point.

This algorithm assumes that the perturbation accelerations are 
known in analytic form. In a lunar flight another check would be added 
to determine when the perturbation due to the Moon should become 
the primary acceleration. The Encke method has been found to be 
quite good for calculating lunar trajectories. See equation (9.2-3) for

9.4 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS OR ELEMENTS (9.3-13) 
The method of the variation of parameters was first developed by 
Euler in 1748 and was the only successful method of perturbations 
used until the more recent development of the machine-oriented Cowell 
and Encke methods. The latter are concerned with a calculation of 
the coordinates whereas the variation of parameters calculates the 
orbital elements or any other consistent set of parameters which 
adequately describe the orbit. Though, at the outset, this method may 
seem more difficult to implement, it has distinct advantages in many 
problems where the perturbing forces are quite small. 
One main difference between the Encke method and the variation of 
parameters method is that the Encke reference orbit is constant until 
rectification occurs. In variation of parameters the reference orbit is 
changing continuously . For instance, if at any two successive points 
along the perturbed trajectory one were to calculate the eccentricity of 
a reference trajectory (unperturbed) using the actual r and v, one would 
observe a small change in eccentricity due to the perturbing forces . 
.6.e 
Then e � .6.t which is an approximation for the time rate of change of 
eccentricity. A similar check could be made on i, a, etc. Thus, the 
orbital parameters of the reference trajectory are changing with time. In 
the absence of perturbation s, they would remain constant. From 
previous work we know that r and v can be calculated from the set of 
six orbital elements (parameters), so if the perturbed elements could be 
calculated as a function of time, then the perturbed state (r and v) 
would be known. 
A two-body orbit can be described by any consistent set of six 

<<<PAGE 412>>>

Sec. 9.4 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS OR ELEMENTS 397 
parameters (or constants) since it is described by three second order 
differential equations. The orbital elements are only one of many 
possible sets (see Baker, Vol 2, p 246, for a table of parameter sets).2 
The essence of the variation of parameters method is to find how the 
selected set of parameters vary With time due to the perturbations. This 
is done by finding analytic expressions for the rate-of-change of the 
paramete rs in terms of the perturbations. These expressions are then 
integrated numerically to find their values at some later time. 
Integrating the expressions analytically is the method of general 
perturbati ons. It is clear that the elements will vary slowly as compared 
to the position and velocity .variations (e.g. the eccentricity may change 
only slightly in an entire orbit) so larger integration steps may be taken 
than in the cases where the total acceleration is being integrate d such as 
in Cowell's method, or the perturbing acceleration is integrated as in 
Encke's method. In this section two sets of parameters will be treated. 
The first will be the classical orbital elements because of their 
familiarity and universality in the literature. The second will be the f 
and 9 expression variations which are of greater practical value and are 
easier to implement.

for illustrative purposes to choose a system in which the derivations are 
the easiest to follow. This derivation partially follows one described in

In the following derivation of"'dt an important difference from the 
previous derivations becomes apparent. Up to now "constants" such as

to the perturbations. Now, however, the state vectors of position and 
velocity will appear in the expression. Since we are considering only the

,due to the perturbation forces. In Chapt�r 4 we described the position 
at any time as a function of ro' va' f, f, 9 and. g, where the f and 9 
expressions were in terms of the universal variable, x. We can express ro 
and va as 
ro = Fr + Gv 
va = Fr + GV (9.4-39) 
F, G, F, G are the same as f, 9, f, 9 except t is replaced by -t and x is 
replaced by -x and rand r a are interchanged. Thus

Note that v includes only the perturbative acceleratio ns. Now the 
perturbed position and velocity can be calculated by numerical 
integration of equations (9.4-44). The corresponding x is determined 
from Kepler's equation (4.4-12), and then position and velocity are 
obtained from equations (4.4-18) and (4.4-19). Note that equation 
(9.4-43) also must be integrated to obtain ex . 
9.4.3 Example to Introduce General Perturbations. The variation of 
parameters method of the previous section is classified as a special 
perturbation te�hnique only because the final integration is 
accomplished numerically . If these equations could be integrated 
analytically , the technique would be that of general perturbations. To 
permit an analytic treatment the perturbation forces can oe expressed 
in a power series and integrated analytically. Though this sounds simple 
enough, in practice the integration may be quite difficult. Also, a series 
solution method of integration is frequently used. In special 
perturbations the result is an answer to one specific problem or set of 
initial conditions. In general perturbations the result will cover many 
cases and will give a great deal more information on the perturbed 
orbit. This is especially true for long duration calculatio ns. To give the 
reader a beginning understanding of general perturbations, a very simple 
example will be treated here which uses the variation of parameters 
method and a series expansion of the perturbing force. 
Consider the equation 
• V x-ex= ---- (9.4-50) 
where ex is a constant and J.I. and vare small numbers. Consider the term 
on the right to be a perturbation. In the absence of the perturbation, 
the solution would be 
x=cxt+c (9.4-51) 

<<<PAGE 426>>>

Sec. 9.4 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS OR ELEMENTS 411 
where c will be the parameter. The constant of integration, C, is 
analogous to the orbital elements in orbital mechanics. Since p. and V 
are small, the solution will vary only slightly from equation (9.4-51), so 
the variation of C to satisfy equation (9.4-50) should be small. From 
equation (9.4-51), allowing c to vary with time, 
x=a+c 
Substituting X and x into equation (9.4-50) and solving for ewe find 
c = v 
[1 + P. (at + c) )2 (9.4-52) 
The right-hand side of equation (9.4-52) is the perturbation and can be 
expanded as 
c = vIl -2p.{at + c) + 3p.2 (at + C)2 -...•... ] (9.4-53) 
The lowest order approximation would be C = v, but more practically 
we would consider 
� = v -2p.v{at + c) 
(9.4-54) 
c + 2p.vc - v = -2p.vat 
which can be easily solved for c. 
a+v a 1 c = ve-2p.vt -at+ -----e-2p.vt for c{O) = v+ --2p.v 2p.v 2p. 
Then x will be be given by equation (9.4-51) correct to first order in J.J.. 
Though this example has no physical significance it clearly 
demonstrate s how the perturbation would be treated analytically using 
a series expansion, which is a common method of expression of the 
perturbation. 
For the reader who wishes to pursue the general perturbation 
analysis Brouwer and Clemence,4 Moultons and many papers discuss it

in detail. Many other approaches could be treated in this chapter, such 
as the disturbing function, Lagrange's planetary variables or derivations 
from Hamiltonian mechanics, but to pursue the topic further here 
would be beyond the scope of this text. 
9.5 COMMENTS ON INTEGRATION SCHEME S AND ERRORS 
The topic of numerical integration in the context of special 
perturbations is both relevant and necessary. No matter how elegant the 
analytic foundations of a particular special perturbation method, the 
results after numerical integration can be meaningless or, at best, highly 
questionable, if the integration scheme is not accurate to a sufficient 
degree. Many results fall into this questionable category because the 
investigator has not understood the limitations of, or has not carefully 
selected, his integration method. Unfortunately, such understanding 
requires a combination of knowledge of numerical analysis and 
experience. The purpose of this section is not the analytic development 
of various integration schemes but is to summarize several methods and 
help the reader to benefit from others' experience so he will be able to 
choose the kind of integration method which will best suit his needs. 
9.5.1 Criteria for Choosing a Numerical Integration Method. The 
selection of an adequate integration scheme for a particular problem is 
too often limited to what is readily available for use rather than what is 
best. In theory, efficiency, not expediency, should be the criteria. The 
problem to be solved should first be analyzed. The following questions 
may help to narrow the selection possibilities: 
a. Is a wide range in the independent variables required (thus a large 
number of integration steps)? 
b. Is the problem extremely sensitive to small errors? 
c. Are the dependent variables changing rapidly (i.e., will a constant 
step-size be satisfactory)? 
Factors to be considered for any given method are speed, accuracy,. 
storage and complexity. Desirable qualities may be in opposition to 
each other such that they all cannot be realized to the fullest extent. 
Some of the desirable qualities of a good integration scheme are: 
a. allow as large a step-size as possible, 
b. variable step-size provision which is simple and fast, 
c. economical in computing time, 
d. the method should be stable such that errors do not exhibit 
exponential growth . 

<<<PAGE 428>>>

Sec. 9.5 INTEGRATION SCHEMES AND ERRORS 413 
e. it should be as insensitive as possible to roundoff errors, and 
f. it should have a maximum and minimum control on truncation 
error. 
Obviously, all of these cannot be perfectly satisfied in anyone 
method, but they are qualities to consider when evaluating an 
integration method. 
9.5.2 Integration Errors. Before evaluating any particular method of 
numerical integration it is important to have some understanding of the 
kind of errors involved. 
In any numerical integration method there are two primary kinds of 
errors that will always be present to some degree. They are roundoff 
and truncation errors. Roundoff errors result from the fact that a 
computer can carry only a finite number of digits of any number. For 
instance, suppose that the machine can carry six digits and we wish to 
add 4.476,276 + 3.388,567 = 7.864,843. In the machine the numbers 
would be rounded off to six significant digits, 
4.476,28 + 3.388,57 = 7.86485 
The true answer rounded off would have a 4 in the sixth digit, but the 
rounding error has caused it to be as. It is clear that the occurrence of 
this roundoff many times in the integration process can result in 
significant errors. Brouwer and Clemence 4 (p 158) give a formula for 
the probable error after n steps as .1124n3/2 (in units of the last 
decimal) or log (.1124n3/2) in number of decimal places. Baker (v 2, p 
270) gives the example of error in 200 integration steps as 
log [.1129 (200)3/2] � 2.5 (9.5-1) 
If six places of accuracy are required then 6 + 2.5 � 9 places must be 
carried in the calculations. The lesson here is that the fewer integration 
steps taken the smaller the -accumula ted roundoff error. The best 
inhibitor to the significant accumulation of roundoff error is the use of 
double precision arithmetic. 
Truncation error is a result of an inexact solution of the differential 
equation. In fact, the numerical integration is actually an exact solution 
of some difference equation which imperfectly represents the actual 
differential equation . Truncation error results from not using all of the 
series expression employed in the integration method. The larger the 

<<<PAGE 429>>>

414 PERTURBATIONS Ch.9 
step-size, the larger the truncation error, so the ideal here is to have 
small step-sizes. Note that this is in opposition to the cure of roundoff 
errors. Thus, errors are unavoidable in numerical integration and the 
object is to use a method that minimizes the sum of roundoff and 
truncation error. Roundoff error is primarily a function of the machine 
(except for some resulting from poor programming technique) and 
truncation error is a function of the integration method. 
9.6 NUMERICAL INTEGRATION METHODS 
Numerical integration methods can be divided into single-step and 
multi-step categorie s. The multi-step methods usually require a 
single-step method to start them at the beginning and after each 
step-size change. Some representative single-step methods are 
Runge-Kutta, Gill, Euler-Cauchy and Bowie. Some of the multi-step 
methods' are Milne , Adams-Moult on, Gauss-J ackson (sum-squared), 
Obrechkoff and Ada ms-Bashforth. The multi-step methods are often 
referred to as predictor-corrector methods. A few of the more common 
methods will be discussed here. In general, we will consider the 
integration of systems of first order differential equations though there 
are methods available to integrate some special second order systems. 
Of course, any second order system can be written as a system of first 
order equations. 
We will treat the first order equation 
dx -= f(t, xl dt 
with initial conditions x(tol = Xo where x and f could be vectors. (9.6-1) 
9.6.1 Runge-Kutt a Method. There is actually a family of 
Runge-Kutta methods of varying orders. The technique approximate s a 
Taylor series extrapola tion of a function by several evaluations of the 
first derivatives at points within the interval of extrapolation. The order 
of a particular member of the family is the order of the highest power 
of the step-s ize, h, in the equivalent Taylor series expansion . The 
formulas for the standard fourth order method are: 
(9.6-2) 
(9.6-3) 

<<<PAGE 430>>>

Sec. 9.6 NUMERICAL INTEGRATION METHODS 
h kl k2 = hf(tn +-, Xn +-) 2 2 
h k2 
k3 = hf(tn + 2: ,xn +"2) 
k4 = hf(tn + h, xn + k3) 
and n is the increment number. 415 
(9.6-3) 
Another member of the Runge-Kutta family is the Runge-Kutta-Gill 
formula. It was developed fpr high-speed computers to use a minimum 
number of storage registers and to help control the growth of roundoff 
errors. This formula is 
1 1 xn+1 = xn +-k +-(1-ry;) k 6 1 3 yl2 2 
1 1 (9.6-4) +-(1 + y;h) k +-k 3 3 6 4 
where kl = hf(tn, Xn) 
h kl 
Is = hf(tn + 2"' Xrl2") 
h (9.6-5) 
k3 = hf(tn + 2"' xn + kl [y'% -%] + k2 [1 -yV:;] ) 
k k = hf(tn + h, xn -_2_+ k3 [1 +ft]) 4 V"'1 
The Runge-Kutta methods are stable and they do not require a 
starting procedure. They are relatively simple, easy to implement, have 
a relatively small truncation error, and step-size is easily changed. One 
of the disadvantages is that there is no simple way to determine the 
truncation error, so it is difficult to determine the proper step-size. One 
obvious failure is that use is made only of the last calculated step. This 
idea leads to multi-step or predictor-corrector methods. 
9.6.2 Adams-Bas hforth Multi-step Method. The multi-step methods 
take advantage of the history of the function being integrated. In 
general, they are faster than the single-step methods, though at a cost of 
greater complexity and a requirement for a starting procedure at the 

<<<PAGE 431>>>

416 PERTURB ATIONS ell. 9 
beginning and after each step-size change. Some multi-step methods 
calculate a predicted value �or xn+ 1 and then substitute xn+ 1 in the 
differential equation to get xn+ 1 ' which is in turn used to calculate a 
corrected value of xn+ l' These are naturally called "predictor-correc­
tor" methods. 
The Adams (sometimes called Adams-Bashforth) formula is 
N 
xn+l = Xn + h L 
k=O 
where N = the number of terms desired 
h = step-size 
n = step number

A method is available for halving or doubling the step-size without a 
complete restart. Also the local truncation error can be calculated (see 
references for detailed formulas). 3 
9.6.3 Adams-Moulton Fonnulas. The Adams-Bashforth method is 
only a multi-step predictor scheme. In 1926 Moulton added a corrctor 

<<<PAGE 432>>>

Sec. 9.6 NUMERIC AL INTEGRATION METHODS 417 
formula to the method. The fourth order formulas retaining third 
differences are given here. The predictor is 
(P) _ h Xn+1 -xn + 24 (55f ri -59f n-1 + 37f n-2 -9f n-3) 
251 5 d5 x(�) +-h 720 dt5 
and the corrector is 
X�l = xn +2� (9fn+1 + 19fn -5fn-1 +fn-2) 
19 5 d5xW 
720h dt5 (9.6-8) 
(9.6-9) 
where the last term in each of the equations is the truncation error 
term. In equation (9.6-9), fn+1 is found from the predicted value 
f n+l = f(tn+l ' X�Jl ) (9.6-1O) 
In using the formulas, the error terms are not generally known, so the 
value used is the expression without those terms {for a discussion of the 
error terms see, for instance, Ralston's text on Numerical Analysis).6 
An estimate of the truncation error for the step from tn to tn+ 1 is 
�I (C) (PII 270 xn+l -xn+1 (9.6-11) 
To use any predictor-corrector scheme the predicted value is 
computed first. Then the derivative corresponding to the predicted 
value is found and used to fmd the corrected value using the corrector 
formula. It is possible to iterate on the corrector formula until there is 
no Significant change in xn+ 1 on successive iterations. The step-size can 
be changed if the truncation error is larger than desired. This method, 

<<<PAGE 433>>>

418 PERTU RBATIONS Ch.9 
like other multi-step methods, requires a single step method to start it 
to obtain f n' f n-1' etc. The Runge-Kutta method is suggested for a 
starter. The Adams-Moulton formulation is one of the more commonly 
used integration methods. 
9.6.4 The Gauss-Jackson or Sum Squared (�2) Method. The 
Gauss-Jackson method is one of the best, and most used, numerical 
integration methods for trajectory problems of the Cowell and Encke 
type. It is designed for the integration of systems of second order 
equations and is faster than integrating two first order equation s. Its 
predictor alone is generally more accurate than the predictor and 
corrector of other methods, though it also includes a corrector. It 
exhibits especially good control of accumulated roundoff error effect. 
It is, though, more complex and difficult for the beginner to implement 
!?an the o�her methods. The general formula for solving the equation 
X = fIt, x, x) is 
x =hi",2 "x,0 + _1 �o n \.LJ n 12 n __ 1_ 82"; + � 84"x,° 240 n 60480 n

and the central differences are defined as 
81f(t )=f(t +h)-f(t -h) n n 2 n 2 
82f(tn) = f(tn + h) + f(tn -h) -2f(tn) 
= fn+1 + fn-1 -2fn 
8kf(t ) = 8k-1f(t + h)-8k-1f(t -h) n n 2 n 2 (9.6-12) 

<<<PAGE 434>>>

Sec. 9.6 NUMERICAL INTEGRATION METHODS 419 
The definition of �2 xn can be found in several references (Baker, V. 
2 and NASA CR-l 005).2, 3 The procedure for calculating it will not be 
reiterated here since it becomes fairly involved and the reader can find 
it easily in the above-mentioned references. 
9.6.5 Numerical Integration Summary . Experience has shown that 
the Gauss-Jackson method is clearly superior for orbital problems using 
the Cowell and Encke techniques. For normal integration of first order 
equations such as occur in the variation of parameters technique, the 
Adams-Moulton or Adams (Adams-Bashforth) methods are preferred. 
The Runge-Kutta method is suggested for starting the multi-step 
methods. Roundoff error is a function of the number of integration 
steps and is most effectively controlled by using double-precision 
arithmetic. Local truncation error can and should be calculated for the 
multi-step methods and should be used as a criterion for changing 
step-size. 
Table 9.6-1 gives a tabular comparison of a number of integration 
methods, including some which were not discussed in this chapter. 
9.7 ANALYTIC FORMULATION OF 
PERTURBATIVE ACCELERATIONS 
A few of the perturbation accelerations commonly used in practice 
will b,e presented in this section. Some of them become quite complex, 
but only the simpler forms will be treated. They will be stated with a 
minimal amount of discussion, but in sufficient detail such that they 
can be used in the methods of this chapter without extensive reference 
to more detailed works. 
9.7-1 The Nonspherical Earth. The simplified gravitational potential 
of the Earth, p/r, is due to a spherically symmetric mass body and 
results in conic orbits. However, the Earth is not a spherically 
symmetric body but is bulged at the equator, flattened at the poles and 
is generally asymmetric. If the potential function, ¢, is known, the 
accelerations can be found from 
One such potential function, according to Vinti, is

which are dependent only on that mass distribution which is symmetric 
about the north-south axis of the Earth (they are not longitude 
dependent). 
The even numbered harmonics are symmetric about the equatorial 
plane and the odd numbered harmonics are antisymme tric. There are 
also tesseral harmonics (dependent on both latitude and longitude) and 
sectorial harmonics (dependent on longitude only). A general 
expression to account for all three classes of harmonics in the potential 
function is given by Baker (Vol 2, p 147),2 but will not be presented 
here. 
There are a few ctmtiol).s to be pointed out in the use of the above 
formulation. The equations are formulated in the geocentric, equatorial 
coordinate system. Therefore, care must be taken to know the Earth's 
current relationship to this inertial frame due to rotation. The zonal 
harmonics 'are not longitude dependent , so the direction of the x axis 
need not point to a fixed geographic point. However, if tesseral and 
sectorial harmonics were considered, then the frame would need to be 
fixed to the rotation of the Earth . To use the acceleration equations in 
the perturbation methods it is necessary to transform the perturbation 
portion (not the::!!:... term) to the RSW system. To do this, simply use r3 
the UK to PQW transformation of Chapter 2-substituting u (argument 
of latitude) for w. Expressions for the Moon's triaxial ellipsoid 
potential can be found in Baker, Vol1.s 
9.7.2 Atmospheric Drag. The formulation of atmospheric drag 
equations is plagued with uncertainties of atmospheric fluctuations, 
frontal areas of orbiting object (if not constant), the drag coefficient, 
and other parameters. A fairly simple formulation will be given here 
(see NASA SP-33).7 Drag, by definition, will be opposite to the 
velocity of the vehicle relative to the atmosphere. Thus, the 
perturbative acceleration is 
.. 1 A • r= --Co -PVara 
2 m (9.7-7) 
where CD = the dimensionle ss drag coefficient associated with A 
A = the cross-sectional area of the vehicle perpendicular to the 
direction of motion

Once again the x, y, z refer to the geocentric, equatorial coordinate

This formulation could be greatly complicated by the addition 
of an expression for theoretical density, altitude above an oblate Earth, 
etc., but the reader can find this in other documents. Equation (9.7-7) 
can give the reader a basic understanding of drag effects. Equations for 
lifting forces will not be presented here. 
9.7.3 Radiation Pressure. Radiation pressure, though small, can have 
considerable effect on large area/mass ratio satellites (such as Echo). In 
the geocentric, equatorial coordinate system the perturbative 
accelerations are 
x = f cos A0 
y = f COS ie sin A0 
z = f sin ie sin A0 (9.7-8)

9.7.4 Thrust. Thrust can be handled quite directly by resolving 
the thrust vector into x, y, z directions. Thus the perturbing acceler­
ation is 
.. x (9.7-9) 
m 
Low thrust problems can be treated using a perturbation approach like 
Encke or Variation of Parameters, but high thrust should be treated 
using the Cowell technique since the thrust is no longer a small 
perturbation, but a major force.

terms ofr and vby t and X by (-t) and {-x}. Prove this assertion.

APPENDIX C 
VECTOR REVIEW 
Vector analysis is a branch of mathematics which saves time and 
space in the derivation of .relationships involving vector quantities. In 
three-dimensional space each vector equation represents three scalar 
equations. Thus, vector analysis is a powerful tool which makes many 
derivations easier and much shorter than otherwise would be possible. 
In this section the fundamental vector operations will be discussed. 
A good understanding of these operations will be of significant help to 
the student in the use of this text. 
C.I DEFINITIONS 
Vector. A vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction. 
Examples are displacement, velocity, force and acceleration . The 
symbol used in the text to represent a vector quantity will be a 
bold-faced letter or a letter with a bar over the top in some illustrations. 
Scalar. A scalar is a quantity having only magnitude. Examples are 
mass, length of a vector, speed, temperature, time or any real signed 
number. The symbol used in the text to represent a scalar quantity will 
be any signed number or a letter not bold-faced or with no bar over it. 
(Example: 3 or A). An exception to this symbology is sometimes 
desirable in which case the symbol for the magnitude of A will be IAI. 
Unit Vector. A unit vector is a vector having unit (1) magnitude. If 
Ais a vector, not a null or zero vector, then 
where lA is the symbol used to denote the unit vector in the direction 
of A Certain sets of vectors are reserved for unit vectors in rectangular 
coordinate systems such as (I, J, K) and (p, Q, W). 
431 

<<<PAGE 447>>>

432 VECTOR REVIE W C 
Equality of Vectors. Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if and 
only if they are parallel, have the same sense of direction and the same 
magnitude, regardless of the position of their origins. 
Coplanar Vectors. Vectors that are parallel to the same straight line 
are said to be collinear. Two collinear vectors differ only by a scalar 
factor. Vectors that are parallel to the same plane are said to be 
coplanar (not necessarily parallel vectors). 
If A, Band C are coplanar vectors, and A and B are not collinear, it 
is possible to express C in terms of A and B. 
The vector C may be resolved into components C1 and C2 parallel to 
Aand B respectively so that 
B 
Since C1 and A are collinear vectors, they differ only by a scalar factor 
a, such that 
C1 = aA, 
Similarly, since C2 and B are collinear we may write 
C2 = bB,. 

<<<PAGE 448>>>

C.2 VECTOR OPERA TIONS 433 
Then C=C1 +C2 =aA+bB. (C.l-l) 
C.2 VECTOR OPERATIO NS 
Addition of Vectors. The sum or result of two vectors A and Bis a 
vector C obtained by constructing a triangle with A and B forming two 
sides of the triangle, B adjoined to A The resultant C starts from the 
origin of A and ends at the terrninus of B. 
C=A+ B 
An obvious extension of this idea is the difference of two vectors. 
Suppose we wish to determine the resultant of A -B which is the same 
as A + (-B). 
Scalar or Dot Product. The "dot" product of two vectors A and B, 
denoted by A • B, is a scalar quantity defined by 
A· B= IAIIBlcos e (C.2-1) 
where e is the angle between the two vectors when drawn from a 
common origin. 
IAI cos e B 
.. 
From the definition of the dot product the following laws are derived: 

<<<PAGE 449>>>

(b) A-(B+C)=A-B+A-C C

AoA= Aft.. . (C.2-2)

Vector or Cross Product. The cross product of two vectors A and B, 
denoted by A x B, is a vector C such that the magnitude of C is the 
product of the magnitud es of A and B and the sine of the angle 
between them. The direction of the vector C is perpendicular to both A 
and B such that A, Band C form a right handed system. That is, if we 
say "A crossed with B" we mean that the resulting vector C will be in 
the direction of the extended thumb when the fingers of the right hand 
are closed from A to B through the smallest angle possible.

C.2 VECTOR OPERATIONS 435 
Icl = IAIIBI sinO (C.2-5) 
If A and B are parallel, then A X B = O. In particular 
AxA=O (C.2-6) 
From the above figure it is easy to see that using the right hand rule: 
AxB*BxA 
BxA=-C 
(Le. e < 180) 
In fact A x B = -(B X A) (C.2-7) 
since in either case the magnitudes are identical, the only difference is 
the sense of the resulting vector C. 
Other laws valid for the cross product are: 
(a) Ax (B+C) =AxB+ Axe 
(b) m(AxB) = (mA) xB=Ax (mB) 
=(AxB)m 
(c) IxI=JxJ=KxK=Q

which more simply stated means that the velocity is the rate of change 
of arc length traveled and is always tangent to the path of the particle. 
This result may be applied to a unit ve ctor (which has constant 
magnitude ). The instantaneous velocity of a unit vector is the rate of 
change of arc length traveled and is tangent to the path. In this special 
case then, the velocity associated with a unit vector is always per­
pendicular to the unit vector and has a magnitude ofw, the instan­
taneous angular velocity of the unit vector.

APPENDIX D 
SUGGE STED PROJECTS 
This appendix presents a series of computer projects which have 
proven to be very valuable in understanding much of the material 
covered in this text. They are especially valuable in developing a 
practical feel for the application of many of the methods. It is 
suggested that universal variables be used wherever possible. 
In describing the projects the term "procedu re" has the same 
meaning as "subroutine" in many computer languages. 
D.I PROJECT SITE/TRACK 
The geographic location of a radar tracking site on the surface of the 
earth is known. Its geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude above 
mean sea level are specified. Observations of a satellite are made by a 
radar at this site at a specified date and universal time. The radar 
determines p, p, EI, EI, Az, AZ from its tracking and doppler capability . 
Compute the geocentric-equatorial components of position and velocity 
of the radar site (RS and VS), and of the satellite (R and V). 
Make two separate procedures for SITE and TRACK such that they 
can be used in a larger program. The input to SITE should be latitude, 
altitude and local sidereal time of the launch site and the output should 
be position and velocity of the site. The input to TRACK should be 
range, range rate, elevation, elevation rate, azimuth, azimuth rate, 
latitude of the launch site, radius vector of the launch site and local 
sidereal time of the launch site. The output will be the radius and 
velocity vectors of the satellite. 
Use standard unit conversions given in the text. An additional 
procedure will be needed to compute local sidereal time (LST) from the 
longitude (LONG, positive to the east) of the launch site, the day (DAY 
where 1 January is day zero) and the universal time (UT). From the

442 SUGGESTED PROJECTS D 
D.2 PROJECT PREDICT 
Project PREDICT is probably the easiest of all the projects in this 
appendix. It requires finding various orbital parameters from given 
vector position and velocity. 
For a number of unidentified space objects the three components of 
vector position and velocity are generated from radar observations (see 
Project SITE/TRACK) . From this information you are required to fmd: 
a. The type of trajectory (circular, rectilinear, elliptical, parabolic, 
hyperbolic). 
b. Position and velocity vectors at impact or closest approach in the 
geocentric-eq uatorial coordinate system. 
c. Time for ob ject to go from its observed position to point of 
impact or closest approach. 
d. The total change in true anomaly from the observed position to 
impact or point of closest approach. Check to see if trajectory is going 
away from the earth. 
Input data for Project PREDICT is stated in terms of the 
geocentric-equatorial inertial componen ts in canonical units:

0.3 PROJECT KEPLER 443 
D.3 PROJECT KEPLER 
Given the position and velocity vectors of a satellite at a particular 
instant of time, you are to determine the position and velocity vectors 
after an interval of time, 61. To solve this problem use the universal 
variable approach and refer closely to section 4.4 of the text for 
guidance. Use a Newtonian iteration to solve for the value of x 
corresponding to the given 61. You will need to write a special 
procedure to calculate the functions S(z) and C(z). To determine when 
convergence has occurred, use 
where 4 is the given time interval and it is compared to the calculated 
61. Write the program as a procedure or subprogram. 
If your iteration process is efficient, you should achieve convergence 
in 5 or 6 iterations. To aid you in this goal the following suggestions 
should be considered. 
a. Put upper and lower bounds on z determined by the computer 
being used. When these bounds are violated you must reduce the 
step size in the Newton iteration such that you go in the correct 
direction but stay within bounds. 
b. If 61 is greater than the period (if it is an ellipse) you should 
reduce the flight time an integral number of periods. 
c. Also for an ellipse, x should never be greater than 2m.jiL 
d. Note that the sign of 61 should always be the same as the sign of 
x. 
On debugging your program it will be helpful for you to print the 
values of x, 61 (calculated), and dt/dx for each iteration. If you do not 
get convergence in 50 iterations, write a message to that effect and go 
to the next data set. The following data is given in earth canonical 
units.

D.4 PROJECT GAUSS 
A satellite in a conic orbit leaves position fl and arrives at position 
f2 at time bt later. It can travel the "short way" (w < 11') or the "long 
way" (w �11'). Given r l' r2, bt, and sign (7T -w), find vIand v 2 • 
Write your program as a procedure or subroutine. Use the universal 
variable method to solve the problem. You will need to write a 
procedure to calculate the transcenden tal functions S(z) and C(z) and 
their derivative s. In this problem you will need to use a Newton 
iteration to iterate on z. For convergence criteria use 
I�I:::;;;; 10-6 for 1 :::;;;; t :::;;;; 106 
It - tcl :::;;;; 10-6 for t < 1 
where tc is the time-of-flight which results from the trial value of z and 
t is the given time-of-flight. If there is no convergence in 50 iterations, 
write a message to that effect and go to the next data set. Follow 
carefully the suggestions given in Chapter 5. For instance note that y 
can never be negative. For ellipses limit z to (211')2. Be careful near the 
point where the value of z corresponds to the t = 0 point in Figure 
5.3-1. One of the data sets tests this situation. 

<<<PAGE 460>>>

0.5 PROJECT INTERCEP T 445 
For trouble shooting purposes you should print out the values of z, 
y, x, tc' dt/dz and znew for each iteration. Also print t:J) and a for 
each data set. 
The plane of the transfer orbit is not uniquely defined if t:J) = IT. 
Check for this case, print out a message and go to the next data set. If 
the orbit is rectilinear (parallel position vectors) the problem can still be 
solved with some special provisions in your program. This is not specifi­
cally required in this problem, so a check should be made for that condi­
tion, a message printed and you should go to the next data set. 
The following data is in canonical units. DM = + 1 specifies a short 
way trajectory and DM = -1 specifies the long way.

D.S PROJECT INTERCEPT 
Write a computer program that takes as its input radar tracking data 
on a target satellite, location of the tracking site, time of radar observation, 
and the location of an interceptor launch site. The output is to be the 
impulsive velocity change required for both intercept and intercept­
plus-rendez vous for various combinations of launch time and 
interceptor time-of-fli ght. Neglect the atmosphere and assume impulsive 
velocity change from the launch site and at the target. See section 5.7 
for further discussion of this project. 
The accomplishment of this project will involve the use of the 

<<<PAGE 461>>>

446 SUGGESTED PROJECTS D 
procedures SITE, TRACK, KEPLER and GAUSS. The launch time of 
the interceptor will be specified in terms of "reaction time" which is 
the time elapsed between tracking of the target and launch of the 
interceptor. 
Specific requirements for the project are as follows: 
a. Remove all intermediate write statements from all procedures 
except the no convergence messages from GAUSS and KEPLER. 
b. To make your program flexible, read in on separate data cards 
the desired starting value of reaction time, the desired increment size 
for reaction time, the number of reaction times desired, the starting 
value of time-of-flight increment size, and the number of time-of-flight 
increments desired. Times should be read in as minutes. 
c. Compute the delta-Vs for both directions (long and short way) 
and save the smaller values in doubly subscripted arrays so that they 
may be printed all at one time. Make any delta-V that correspon ds to a 
long way around transfer orbit negative so you can identify it when 
printed out. Print out the velocities in km/sec even though calculations 
are in canonical units. 
d. If the interceptor strikes the earth enroute to the target, assign 
delta-V some large value such as 1010. If the interceptor strikes the 
earth enroute to the target for both directions of motion this will cause 
asterisks to be printed in your output (in most computers). 
e. When you point out your arrays, list reaction times down the left 
side and time-of-flight across the top. Print out only 3 places after the 
decimal for the delta-Vs. 
f. Use the accompanying flow diagram as a guide for your program. 
g. Make some provision to print out all of your input data, all 
variables of interest in the calculations (for the first delta-V calculation 
only) and the local sidereal time of the launch site for each reaction 
time. This will aid you in verifying your solution. 
Use data as follows: 
Location of launch site (Johnston Island): 
Latitude: 16.450 N Longitude: 169.320 W 
Elevation : 5 feet 
Radar tracking site data (Shemya): 
Latitude: 52.450 N
