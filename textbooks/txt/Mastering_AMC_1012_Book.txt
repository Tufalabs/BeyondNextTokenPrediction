OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
1.1 Factorials
Definition 1.1.1. A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a
given positive integer. In other words n! =n×(n−1)×(n−2)×···× 1.
1.2 Permutations Basics
Definition 1.2.1. A permutation is a possible arrangement of objects in a set where the
order of objects matter.
Theorem 1.2.2 (Number of Orderings of Objects)
The number of ways of arranging nobjects in a line is n!
The number of ways of arranging nobjects in a circle where rotations of the same
arrangement aren’t considered distinct is ( n−1)!
The number of ways of arranging nobjects in a circle where rotations of the same
arrangement aren’t considered distinct and reflections of the same arrangement aren’t
considered distinct is(n−1)!
2
Remark 1.2.3
The reason that this is true is because we can simply fix 1 person to be at the top and
there are (n−1)! ways to arrange the other people. This accounts for rotations since
rotating an arrangement will result in someone else on top. We divide by 2 for reflections
because of symmetry on both the left and right sides of the person chosen to be at the
top.
Theorem 1.2.4 (Permutations Formula)
The number of ways to arrange kobjects out of ntotal objects is
nPk=n!
(n−k)!

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
1.3 Permutations with Restrictions
Example 1.1
How many 4 digit numbers exist such that the first digit is odd and the other 3 digits
are even and all digits distinct?
Solution
The first digit has 5 choices (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). The 2nd digit also has 5 choices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
Do we have to subtract any of the choices of the 2nd digit to make sure the
numbers are distinct?
Keep in mind that although the digits have to be distinct, the 2nd digit is even and
the first digit is odd, so there is no overlap.
The 3rd digit can be any even number except the one chosen for the 2nd digit, so it has
4 choices. The 4th digit can be any even number except those chosen for the 2nd and 3rd digit.
In total, the number of 4 digit numbers with these constraints is
5×5×4×3 = 300
Example 1.2 (Omega Learn)
Gauss, Pauli, Einstein, Newton, Edison, and Faraday are sitting at a circular table.
Einstein, Newton, and Faraday are enemies so they refuse to sit next to each other.
With this condition, how many ways are there for the 6 physicists to sit at the table if
rotations are not counted as distinct orientations?
Solution
Without the condition, the answer would just be (6 −1)! = 5! = 120 as we can fix 1 of the 6
people at the top and permute the remaining 5 people.
Where must the enemies sit so that none of them are sitting next to each
other?
Since there are only 6 total people, there must be exactly one other person between each of
the enemies as seen in the diagram below where the red X’s represent the enemies.
12
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
Should we again try to fix someone at the top to deal with rotations?
Yes! By fixing Gauss at the top (arbitrarily), we can now simply order the remaining
5 people without having to worry about the rotation condition.
How many ways to permute the enemies?
Note that the 3 possible locations of the enemies is fixed so there are 3! ways to permute them.
How many ways to permute the people with no enemies?
We already fixed Gauss (someone without enemies) so there are 2! ways to permute the other
2 people who don’t have enemies.
In total, our answer is
3!×2! = 12
Example 1.3 (Omega Learn)
How many 6 digit numbers exist such that all the digits are distinct, and it’s first 2 digits
are 6 or more, the last 2 digits are 5 or less, and the 3rd digit is a nonzero multiple of 7?
Video Solution

Example 1.4
Peter is packing his pencil case for the AMC 12. He must pack 3 distinct pencils, 2
distinct erasers, and 2 distinct markers in some order. However, he will not put an item
in his case if there are already more of that type of item than any other type of item.
(Eg. Peter will not put another pencil in his case if there are already more pencils than
markers or more pencils than erasers in the case). How many different orders are there
for Peter to put items in his case?

1.4 Word Rearrangements
Theorem 1.4.1 (Word Rearrangements)
The number of ways to order a word is
n!
d1!×d2!×d3!×...
wherenis the number of letters and d1,d2,d3,... are the number of times each of the
letters that occur more than 1 time appear in the word.
Example 1.5
How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in COMPUTER such that the C, O,
M, and P stay together (not necessarily in the same order)?
Solution
This problem is slightly different from the standard word rearrangement problems because
we now have a constraint.
How should we deal with the condition that the COMP must stay together?
Let’s treat COMP as 1 block. Since the letters anyways have to stay together, let call this
block aCOMP . Now, instead, we can find the number of arrangments of COMP UTER.
How many ways are there to arrange COMP UTER?
14
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
Notice that this is just 5! since all the letters (or symbols) are different.
Now, are we done, or is there something we forgot to account for?
Remember that letters in the word COMP can appear in any order inside the box, so
we have to also account for rearrangements of these letters within the COMP .
For each unique arrangement of COMP UTER, how many ways are there to
arrange the letters in the word COMP ?
There are 4! ways to arrange the 4 letters C O M P.
Therefore, in total, there are 5! ×4! = 120×24 = 2880 ways to rearrange COMPUTER
such that the letters COMP remain together.
Example 1.6 (AIME)
In a shooting match, eight clay targets are arranged in two hanging columns of three
targets each and one column of two targets. A marksman is to break all the targets
according to the following rules:
1) The marksman first chooses a column from which a target is to be broken.
2) The marksman must then break the lowest remaining target in the chosen column.
If the rules are followed, in how many different orders can the eight targets be broken?
Video Solution
15
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
Remark 1.4.2
This is not only true for words! The number of ways of arranging objects or anything
else is also the same.
Example 1.7 (AMC 10)
Using the letters A,M,O,S, andU, we can form five-letter ”words”. If these ”words”
are arranged in alphabetical order, then the ”word” USAMO occupies position
Video Solution
Remark 1.4.3
Don’t forget to add 1 to the number of words before USAMO in alphabetical order!
1.5 Combinations
Definition 1.5.1. A combination is a possible arrangement in a collection of items where
the order of the selection does not matter.
Remark 1.5.2
Usually, the words ”permute”, ”order does matter”, etc. imply a permutation while the
words ”choose”, ”select”, ”order doesn’t matter”, etc. imply a combination.
Theorem 1.5.3 (Combinations Formula)
The number of ways to choose kobjects out of a total of nobjects is
/parenleftiggn
k/parenrightigg
=n!
k!(n−k)!=n(n−1)...(n−k+ 1)
k!
This is typically spoken as ”n choose k”
Remark 1.5.4
Notice that /parenleftiggn
k/parenrightigg
=/parenleftiggn
n−k/parenrightigg
16
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
This is true because we can see choosing kobjects on the left hand side is equivalent to
then−kobjects that will not be selected on the right hand side.
Example 1.8 (Omega Learn)
There are 6 experienced applicants and 7 inexperienced applicants applying for a job.
Out of the experienced applicants, 2 managers are selected. Out of all of the other
applicants who aren’t selected for a manager (both experienced and inexperienced), 4
other employees are selected. How many ways are there to do this?
Solution
To solve this problem, we will find the number of ways of choosing managers and other
employees separately.
First, how many ways are there to select 2 managers?
Since they must be from the 6 experienced applicants, there are
/parenleftigg6
2/parenrightigg
=6×5
2!=30
2= 15
Next, how many ways are there to select the 5 other employees?
Since 2 of the experienced applicants were already selected, there are 4 experienced ap-
plicants and 7 inexperienced applicants left.
Therefore, we must select 4 employees out of the 11 remaining people. We can do this
in/parenleftigg11
4/parenrightigg
=11×10×9×8
4!=11×10×72
24= 11×10×72
24= 11×10×3 = 330
Therefore, in total, how many ways are there to select the 3 managers and
5 other employees?
Since there are 15 ways to select the managers and 330 ways to select the other employees,
there will be 15×330 = 4950 ways to select both the managers and the employees.

Example 1.9 (Omega Learn)
You have 12 different energy bars that you need to give to 3 people: Alice, Betty, and
Chase. Alice needs 3 bars, Betty needs 4 bars, and Chase needs 5 bars. How many ways
are there to distribute the 12 bars to satisfy their requirements?
Video Solution
Example 1.10 (EMCC)
How many ways are there to place 4 balls into a 4 ×6 grid such that no column or row
has more than one ball in it? (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.)
Video Solution
Example 1.11
Robert has 4 indistinguishable gold coins and 4 indistinguishable silver coins. Each coin
has an engraving of one face on one side, but not on the other. He wants to stack the
eight coins on a table into a single stack so that no two adjacent coins are face to face.
Find the number of possible distinguishable arrangements of the 8 coins.
Solution
First, let’s deal with the orderings of the coins.
How many ways to arrange the 4 gold and 4 silver coins?
We can use the word rearrangement formula to get8!
4!×4!= 70. Now, we will the num-
ber of ways to put the coins face up or face down in the stack
If a coin is face down, what must the coin above it be?
It can be anything and the faces will never meet.
If a coin is face up, what must the coin above it be?
It must also be face up as if it’s face down, then the faces will meet.
18
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
The moment the coin first becomes face up, all the remaining coins on top must be face up
as well! If none of the coins are face up, then there is 1 orientation.
How many orientations exist if at least 1 of the coins is face up?
We simply have to pick a coin to be the first face up coin and every other coin’s orien-
tation is fixed. There are 8 ways to do this.
In total, we have 9 orientations for the faces of the coins and/parenleftig8
4/parenrightig
= 70 ways to order
the gold and silver coins giving us an answer of 70 ×9 = 630 .
1.6 Subsets
Theorem 1.6.1
The number of subsets of a set of size nis 2n.
Remark 1.6.2
We have 2 choices for each element in the set: whether to include or not include the
element in our subset, and since there are nelements in the set, the total number of
subsets is 2×2×2×···× 2 (n times).
Note: This means that one of our subsets is the empty subset, where we decide to
not include all of the elements. Remember to check the problem wording whether we
should count the empty subset as valid or not.
Example 1.12 (AMC 10)
Two subsets of the set S={a,b,c,d,e}are to be chosen so that their union is Sand
their intersection contains exactly two elements. In how many ways can this be done,
assuming that the order in which the subsets are chosen does not matter?
Video Solution
19
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 1. Permutations and Combinations
Example 1.13 (AIME)
For{1,2,3,...,n}and each of its non-empty subsets a unique alternating sum is defined
as follows. Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning
with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the
alternating sum for {1,2,3,6,9}is 9−6 + 3−2 + 1 = 5 and for {5}it is simply 5. Find
the sum of all such alternating sums for n= 7.
Solution
It’s definitely possible to manually add them for all possible subsets. However, there is a
much more clever way of approaching this problem.
Forn= 3, what is the sum of all alternating sums?
As seen in the table, the total sum is 12. In fact, we can pair up the subsets so that
the sum of each pair is 3!
Why can we pair up the subsets as shown?
For every alternating sum that includes 3 of the form 3 - x, by removing the 3 from
the alternating sum becomes xas all the numbers that were added in the original alternating
sum will be subtracted in the alternating sum without 3 and vice versa!. Therefore, everything
will cancel out but the 3!.
By extending this logic, what is the sum of alternating sums for n= 7?
Like earlier, we pair up all subsets that include and 7 and ones that don’t include a 7.
In total, we have27
2= 64 pairs each with a sum of 7 giving an answer of 64 ×7 = 448 .

2.1 Probability Basics
Definition 2.1.1. Probability is the chance something occurs.
Theorem 2.1.2 (Probability)
probability =Total number of Desired Outcomes
Total Outcomes
Example 2.1
In the array of 13 squares shown below, 8 squares are colored red, and the remaining 5
squares are colored blue. If one of all possible such colorings is chosen at random, the
probability that the chosen colored array appears the same when rotated 90 degrees
around the central square is1
n, where n is a positive integer. Find n.
Solution
The first step to any probability problem is finding the number of successful outcomes.
What must happen so that when the figure is rotated the same coloring ap-
pears?
The top L shape must look the same as the right L shape, which must look the same
as the bottom L shape, which must look the same as the left L shape. Essentially, all 4 L
shapes must be colored in the exact same way.
How can this be done with 5 blue and 8 red squares?
The number of total blue squares in all of the L’s is a multiple of 4 and since there are a
total of 5 blue squares, there must be 4 total blue squares amongst the L’s and the center
28
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Probability
square must also be colored blue. Due to the identical coloration discovered earlier, we must
pick one of the squares for all the L’s and color them blue. There are 3 ways to do this.
How many total ways are there to color the array?
There are 13 squares and any 5 of them can be blue so/parenleftig13

. This gives a probability
of3

2.2 Distinguishability
Example 2.2
I have cards numbered from 1 to 10. What is the probability I pick a pair of 2 different
cards that have an odd product?
Solution
This is a rather simple example however it demonstrates an important point about distin-
guishability in probability problems.
What must happen for the cards to have an odd product?
29
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Probability
Both cards must be odd.
How many pairs of cards have both cards odd?
If order does not matter, then there are/parenleftig5
2/parenrightig
= 10 combinations. However, if the order
does matter, then there are 5 ×4 = 20 permutations.
How many total pairs of cards can be chosen?
If order does not matter, then there are/parenleftig10
2/parenrightig
= 45 combinations. However, if the or-
der does matter, then there are 10 ×9 = 90 permutations.
So does the order matter of the cards in the pair matter or not?
If the order of the cards in the pair does matter, then the probability is20
90=2
9.
If the order of the cards in the pair does not matter, then the probability is10
45=2
9.
Why are the probabilities are the same?
When dealing with ordered pairs, the number of successful and total pairs were multiplied by
2! so they would cancel out when dividing.
Remark 2.2.1
In probability problems, whether you decide to multiply for order or not is up to you as
both will give the same probability.
Example 2.3
The sum of 2 positive integers is 4. Find the probability that one of the integers is a 2.
Solution
There are 2 cases:
1. Both integers are 2
2. One integer is a 3 and the other is a 1
So is the probability just1
2?
30
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 2. Probability
No! While there are only 2 cases, they both have different chances of happening.
How many ways are there for each case to happen?
There is only 1 way where both integers can be 2 however there are 2 ways one of the
integers is a 1 and the other is a 3 as we can flip them. The 2nd case is more likely.
What is the probability with this knowledge?
There are a total of 3 cases of which 1 satisfies the condition so the probability is1
3.
Remark 2.2.2
If you decide not to multiply for order when doing probability problems, make sure the
number of orderings is consistent across all cases. In the first problem, every pair had 2
orderings. The same would be true for groups of 5 for example as there are always 5!
ways to order the elements in the group. However, in the 2nd problem, the two cases
had different number of orderings so this doesn’t work.
Example 2.4 (AIME)
A deck of forty cards consists of four 1’s, four 2’s,..., and four 10’s. A matching pair (two
cards with the same number) is removed from the deck. Given that these cards are not
returned to the deck, letm
nbe the probability that two randomly selected cards also
form a pair, where mandnare relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.

2.3 Probability of Independent Events
Remark 2.3.1
Whenever we need to find the probabilities of 2 independent events happening (the
results of the events don’t depend on each other), we can simply find the probability of
each event individually and multiply them together.
Example 2.6 (Omega Learn)
Person A rolls a dice with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 6, 15, 30 and Person B rolls a dice
with the numbers 1, 2, 4, 18, 28, 44. What is the probability that the product of the 2
numbers is a multiple of 24?

2.4 Probability of Dependent Events
Remark 2.4.1
When the events are dependent, the probability of both events happening (say A and
B) is the probability of event A happening times the probability that event B happens
given that event A already happened.
Example 2.8 (AIME)
There is a 40% chance of rain on Saturday and a 30% chance of rain on Sunday. However,
it is twice as likely to rain on Sunday if it rains on Saturday than if it does not rain on

3.1 Casework
Many counting or probability problems can be solved by dividing a problem into several cases
and calculating arrangements and probabilities for each case before summing them together.
Concept 3.1.1
When doing casework, always try to minimize the number of cases you have to deal with.
Example 3.1 (Omega Learn)
There are 3 identical blue boxes, 6 identical green boxes, and 5 distinct items. Each of
the items must be placed into either a green or blue box, and each box can contain a
maximum of 1 item. Assuming all of the boxes are different, how many ways are there
to do this?
Solution
There are 5 items to be put in some of the 9 green and blue boxes, so we must choose 5 of
these 9 boxes to put the items into.
How can we divide this problem into cases?
We can choose our cases based on the number of green and blue boxes we are selecting. The
cases are
1. 3 blue boxes, 2 green boxes
2. 2 blue boxes, 3 green boxes
3. 1 blue box, 4 green boxes
4. 0 blue boxes, 5 green boxes
Notice that this covers all the cases because it covers all possible number of blue boxes.
Clearly, 6 green boxes is impossible since we only have to select 5 of them to put items into.
Also, make sure to keep in mind that the boxes of the same color are identical.
Case 1: 3 blue boxes, 2 green boxes
For this case, how many ways are there to put 5 items into 3 blue and 2 green
boxes?
We can count this be seeing that we simply have to choose 3 of the items to place into the
42
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 3. Casework
blue boxes, and the other items will be put in green boxes. We don’t have to worry about
order of the items in the blue boxes (or the green boxes) because the boxes of the same color
are identical. We can do this in/parenleftig5
3/parenrightig
ways.
Case 2: 2 blue boxes, 3 green boxes Again, we do this by choosing 2 of the items to
put into blue boxes, and the remaining 3 items will be put into green boxes. We can do this
in/parenleftig5
2/parenrightig
ways.
Case 3: 1 blue boxes, 4 green boxes Out of the 5 items, we must choose 1 of them
for a blue box and the remaining 4 will go in green boxes. We can do this in/parenleftig5
1/parenrightig
ways.
Case 4: 0 blue boxes, 5 green boxes Because all of the items must go in green boxes,
there is only 1 way to do this.
In total among all the cases, there are

A bug starts at a vertex of an equilateral triangle. On each move, it randomly selects

triangle to that vertex. Given that the probability that the bug moves to its starting
vertex on its tenth move is m/n, wheremandnare relatively prime positive integers,
findm+n.
Solution
For this problem, we will do casework on the number of clockwise and counterclockwise
moves. Say there are A clockwise moves and B counterclockwise moves.
What must happen for the bug to reach the starting vertex in 10 moves?
The number of clockwise and counterclockwise moves must differ by a multiple of 3 as
every 3 moves the bug will just cycle around the triangle and come back to the starting
vertex.

How many move orderings exist if the number of clockwise and counter-clockwise
moves differs by 0?
We haveA+B= 10 andA−B= 0 which implies A= 5,B= 5. There must be 5
clockwise and 5 counterclockwise moves so/parenleftig10
5/parenrightig
= 252 orderings.
How many move orderings exist if the number of clockwise and counter-clockwise
moves differs by 3?
We haveA+B= 10 andA−B= 3. Adding the equations, we get 2 A= 13 which
has no integer solutions. There is no possible ways in this case. The same is true if B−A= 3
by symmetry.
How many move orderings exist if the number of clockwise and counter-clockwise
moves differs by 6?
We haveA+B= 10 andA−B= 6. Adding the equations, we get 2 A= 16 =⇒A= 8,B= 2.
We have 8 clockwise moves and 2 counterclockwise moves or 8 counter-clockwise moves. By
symmetry, 2 counterclockwise moves and 8 clockwise moves also works. Both of these have/parenleftig10
2/parenrightig
= 45 orderings.

Example 3.7 (AIME)
Four ambassadors and one advisor for each of them are to be seated at a round table with
12 chairs numbered in order 1 to 12. Each ambassador must sit in an even-numbered
chair. Each advisor must sit in a chair adjacent to his or her ambassador. There are
Nways for the 8 people to be seated at the table under these conditions. Find the
remainder when Nis divided by 1000.
Solution
We will break this into cases based on where the ambassadors are.
Case 1: They are in adjacent even numbered chairs
In this case, there are 6 configurations possible by rotating the table.
46
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 3. Casework
How many ways are there to place the advisors?
There are 5 ways as shown below. Blue represents the ambassadors and red represents
the advisors.
In addition, there are 4! ways to arrange the ambassadors amongst each other so we get a
total of 4!×6×5 = 720 for this case.
Case 2: 3 are in adjacent even numbered chairs and the other is separated
In this case, there are also 6 possible configurations by rotating.
How many ways are there to place the advisors?
We can find the number of advisor placements for the 3 ambassadors sitting adjacent
and for the 1 ambassador sitting away separately and multiply.
How many ways are there to place the advisors around the 3 adjacent am-
bassadors?
By similar logic to earlier, there are 4 placements of the advisors. For the 1 ambassador
sitting alone, there is simply 2 choices for the advisor. In total, we have 6 possibilities for
where the advisor can sit.
Like earlier, we multiply by 4! for ambassador arrangements. This gives 4! ×8×6 = 1152.
Case 3: 2 groups of 2 adjacent ambassadors
This time, there are only 3 rotational orientations due to the symmetry between the 2
groups of ambassadors.
How many ways are there to place the advisors around the ambassadors?
47
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 3. Casework
For each group of 2, there are 3 ways to place the advisors giving us a total of 3 ×3 = 9.
For this case, we have 4! ×3×9 = 648.
In total, we have 720 + 648 + 1152 = 2 520 .
3.2 Conditional Probability
Concept 3.2.1
If a problem asks you the probability an event A happens given that another event B
has already happened, the probability formula can be adjusted to
Probability =Number of Ways where A and B happen
Number of Ways where B happens
.
Sometimes, it may be necessary to fully deal with probabilities.
Probability =Probability A and B happen
Probability B happens
Example 3.8
What is the probability that the sum of two dice is 7 given that at least one of the dice
rolled a 6?
Solution
This is a standard conditional probability problem.
How many ways are there for the sum of two dice to be 7 and at least one
of the dice rolled to be a 6?
There are 2 ways: 61, 16. Any higher dice rolls along with 6 will exceed 7 and thus
not work.
How many ways with 2 dice are there such that at least one of them is 6?
If there is only one 6, then there are 5 choices for the other dice roll and 2 ways to order
the 2 dice rolls giving 5 ×2 = 10. If there are 2 6’s, there is just 1 way. This gives a total of 11.
48
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 3. Casework
Therefore, the probability is2
11.
Example 3.9 (HMMT Modified)
Victor has a drawer with two red socks, two green socks, two blue socks, and 4 orange
socks. He repeatedly draws two socks at a time from the drawer at random, and stops if
the socks are of the same color. However, Victor is red-green colorblind, so he also stops
if he sees a red and green sock. What is the probability that Victor stops with two socks
of the same color? Assume Victor returns both socks to the drawer at each step.
Solution
Note that Victor keeps drawing socks until he picks up a matching pair or red-green pair.
However, Victor returns the socks back to the drawer after every step. Eventually, he will
draw a matching pair or red-green pair so the problem is equivalent to Given that Victor
draws a matching pair or red-green pair, find the probability the pair is matching .
How many ways are there to draw a matching pair?
There is/parenleftig2
2/parenrightig
= 1 way for each of red, green, or blue socks but there are/parenleftig4
2/parenrightig
= 6 ways
for the orange socks. In total, 9 ways.
How many ways are there to draw a matching or red-green pair?
We already found that there are 9 matching pairs. In addition, since there are 2 red
and 2 green socks, there are 2 ×2 = 4 red-green pairs for a total of 13.
Therefore, our answer is9

Example 3.10 (AMC 10)
In a particular game, each of 4 players rolls a standard 6-sided die. The winner is the
player who rolls the highest number. If there is a tie for the highest roll, those involved
in the tie will roll again and this process will continue until one player wins. Hugo is
one of the players in this game. What is the probability that Hugo’s first roll was a 5 ,
given that he won the game?
Solution
49
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 3. Casework
We can try to find the number of ways Hugo rolls a 5 and wins and the number of ways Hugo
wins as usual.
What are the complications with this?
For example, one possible outcome is that the 4 players roll 5, 4, 2, 1. Another possi-
ble outcome is that the 4 players roll 4, 4, 3, 2 and the 2 players who rolled a 4 roll again
and get 6, 3. Note that these outcomes do not have the same probability of happening!
That’s why in this question it’s better to deal directly with probabilities and we can find
Probability Hugo Rolls a 5 and Wins
Probability Hugo Wins
. We’ll start by finding the probability Hugo rolls a 5 and wins.
What are the possible cases in which this can happen?
Hugo can roll strictly higher than everyone else or tie with 1 or more people. Case 1:
Hugo rolls strictly higher than everyone
Firstly, the probability Hugo rolls a 5 is1
6. Next, the probability everyone else rolls a
4 or less is4
6. In total, we have (1
6)×(4

Case 2: Hugo ties with 1 other person
Again, the probability Hugo rolls a 5 is1
6. There are 3 ways to select the person Hugo ties
with and there is a1
6probability they roll a 5. Also, there is a4
6probability the other 2
people roll a 4 or lower. In total, we have 3 ×(1

1296.
What is the probability Hugo will win the tiebreaks?
This is just1

Case 3: Hugo ties with 2 other people
The probability Hugo rolls a 5 is1
6. There are/parenleftig3

Case 4: Hugo ties with 3 other people
The probability they all roll 5’s is (1
6)4=1

tiebreaks giving us1
4×1296.
Now, what is the probability Hugo wins (ignoring any other constraints)?

Remark 3.2.2
On the problems, try to be as careful as possible and avoid making mistakes as casework
problems in general, and very easy to mess up. A tip to do so is to write all possible
cases first before finding the number of ways in each case. This helps make sure you
don’t forget any cases.

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 4. Complementary Counting
Complementary counting is the problem solving technique of counting the opposite of
what we want and subtracting that from the total number of cases. The keyword “at least”
indicates that complementary counting may be helpful.
Remark 4.0.1
Often times, we have to use casework in conjuction with other techniques like comple-
mentary counting.
Example 4.1
How many subsets of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10 }have at least 1 even number
and do not contain all of the elements?
Solution
How can we use complementary counting?
We can find the total number of subsets and subtract the subsets which have no even
numbers and contain all of the elements. Note that both having no even numbers and
containing all of the elements cannot happen, so we don’t have to worry about overlap
between the subsets that don’t work.
Case 1: Subset contains all of the elements
There is only 1 subset that contains all of the elements (the original set).
Case 2: Subset contains no even elements
If there are no even elements, then we simply have to pick some odd numbers from {1,
3, 5, 7, 9}for our subset.
How many ways are there to do this?
Remember that each element has 2 choices (to be in subset or not in subset), so the
number of ways to form our subset from just odd numbers is 25= 32.
Therefore in total, 1 + 32 = 33 ways don’t work.
Next, how many total subsets are there?
Since there are 10 elements and each element has 2 choices, there are 210= 1024 sub-
sets.
63
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 4. Complementary Counting
Therefore the number of valid subsets is 1024 −33 = 991

Let’s first begin by choosing the 4 distinct digits we will use.
How many ways are there to do this?
There are/parenleftig10
4/parenrightig
ways to select 4 digits.
Given 4 digits, how many orderings of the digits are possible?
64
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 4. Complementary Counting
From the condition, the 2nd digit must larger than the 1st digit, the 3rd digit must be
smaller than the 2nd digit, and the 4th digit must be larger than the 3rd digit. Essentially,
the 2nd and 4th digits are larger than their neighboring digits.
Say we choose the 4 digits a,b,c,d wherea<b<c<d .
How can we find the number of orderings?
There are many ways, but we will do casework on the location of d.dmust be either
the 2nd or 4th digit. If dis the 4th digit, then the 2nd digit must be cas it has to be
larger than the first and third digits. Then, there are 2 ways to flip aandbamongst the
1st and 3rd digits giving a total of 2 ways for this case ( acbd,bcad ). Ifdis the 2nd digit,
then the 4th digit has to be borc. If the 4th digit is c, then we have 2 ways to order a
andbas before (( adbc,bdac ). If the 4th digit is b, then the 3rd digit must be ain order
for it to be smaller than the 4th digit making the 1st digit c. This gives us 1 more way
(cdab). In total, we have 5 orderings. Multiplying the 5 orderings by/parenleftig10
4/parenrightig
gives 1050 numbers.
Are we overcounting any 4 digit numbers that have 0 as a starting digit?
Yes! If 0 is chosen as one of our digits, there are/parenleftig9
3/parenrightig
ways to choose the remaining 3 digits.
0 in this case is the smallest digit and therefore must be a. Therefore, the number of invalid or-
derings are the ones that have aas the first digit. Looking at the possible orderings above, we
find 2 such orderings. Therefore, the number of overcounted numbers is/parenleftig9
3/parenrightig
×2 = 84×2 = 168.
Our answer is 1050 −168 = 882
Example 4.5 (AMC 10)
Frieda the frog begins a sequence of hops on a 3 ×3 grid of squares, moving one square
on each hop and choosing at random the direction of each hop-up, down, left, or right.
She does not hop diagonally. When the direction of a hop would take Frieda off the grid,
she ”wraps around” and jumps to the opposite edge. For example if Frieda begins in the
center square and makes two hops ”up”, the first hop would place her in the top row
middle square, and the second hop would cause Frieda to jump to the opposite edge,
landing in the bottom row middle square. Suppose Frieda starts from the center square,
makes at most four hops at random, and stops hopping if she lands on a corner square.
What is the probability that she reaches a corner square on one of the four hops?

4.1 Complementary Counting with Symmetry
Example 4.6
You flip 10 fair coins. What is the probability of flipping more heads than tails?
Solution
One way to do this is with casework. However, this will require a lot of cases. Let’s try to
find a simpler solution with symmetry.
How can we use the symmetry between heads and tails?
Keep in mind that the probability of flipping heads is the same as the probability of flipping
tails. Therefore, heads and tails are symmetric and the probability of flipping more heads
than tails is the same as the probability of flipping more tails then heads.
Is the answer1
2then?
Unfortunately, no because it’s also possible that an equal number of heads and tails and
flipped.
How can we account for this in our symmetry argument?
Note that P(Total ) = 1 =P(More Heads ) +P(More Tails ) +P(Equal Heads and Tails )
and sinceP(More Heads) = P(More Tails) we can rewrite our equation as
1 = 2P(More Heads) + P(Equal Heads and Tails)
. Once we find the value of P(Equal Heads and Tails ), we can easily solve for P(More Heads )!
What isP(Equal Heads and Tails )?
There are/parenleftig10
5/parenrightig
= 252 ways to flip 5 heads and 5 tails. The total number of possible
flips is 210 = 1024. Therefore, this probability is252
1024=63
256.
From this, what is P(More Heads )?
We can plug this into our equation
1 = 2P(More Heads) +63

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 4. Complementary Counting
and solving we get P(More Heads) =(1−63

Example 4.7 (AMC 10/12)
Bernardo randomly picks 3 distinct numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}and
arranges them in descending order to form a 3-digit number. Silvia randomly picks 3
distinct numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}and also arranges them in descending
order to form a 3-digit number. What is the probability that Bernardo’s number is
larger than Silvia’s number?
Solution
In this problem, casework would be extremely tedious. We will try to do a symmetry approach
as we did last time. However, Bernado can pick from the numbers 1 to 9 while Silvia can
only pick from the numbers 1 to 8.
How can we deal with the case one of Bernado’s numbers is a 9 separately?
Bernado selects 3 numbers from 1 to 9 so the probability that 9 is one of them is3
9=1
3.
What happens if Bernado selects a 9?
Bernado’s number must be larger as his number will have 9 at the hundreds digit. Re-
gardless of Silvia’s largest number, her number can have a hundreds digit of at most 8 so will
always be smaller. Therefore, there is a1
3chance Bernado automatically wins.
In the2
3chance Bernado does not pick a 9, is there symmetry?
Yes! In the case where Bernado does not pick a 9, he is picking from the digits 1 to 8
so the situation is analagous to Silvia’s. Like in the previous problem, we write the equation
1 =P(Bernado number larger) + P(Silvia number larger) + P(Numbers Same
. Note that P(Bernado number larger) = P(Silvia number larger) so we get
1 = 2P(Bernado number larger) + P(Numbers Same)
so it suffices to find the probability the numbers are the same.
What is this probability?
They both have/parenleftig8
3/parenrightig
= 56 options for their 3 digits. For every choice of 3 digits by Bernado,
67
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 4. Complementary Counting
there is exactly 1 possible choice by Silvia that will result in the same number. Therefore,
this probability is1
56.
We can now solve to get P(Bernado number larger) =1−1

In total, amongst both cases, our probability is1

Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion

73
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
Definition 5.0.1. The principle of inclusion and exclusion (PIE) is a counting technique
that computes the number of elements that satisfy at least one of several properties while
guaranteeing that elements satisfying more than one property are not counted twice.
Definition 5.0.2 (Union Symbol) .|A∪B|is the union of elements in both A and B
(duplicates are only written once)
Definition 5.0.3 (Intersection Symbol) .|A∩B|is the intersection of elements in both A
and B (only those elements which are in both sets)
Theorem 5.0.4 (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion for 2 Sets)
Given two sets,|A1|and|A2|
|A1∪A2|=|A1|+|A2|−|A1∩A2|
Basically, we count the number of possibilities in 2 ”things” and subtract the duplicates.
Example 5.1
Find how many numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) that are divisible by 2 or 7.
Solution
To solve this problem, let’s first find how many numbers are divisible by 2 and how many
numbers are divisible by 7
How many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 2?
Every 2nd number is divisible by 2, so all the numbers from 2 ×1 to 2×50 work. Therefore,
from 1 to 100 there are 50 numbers divisible by 2.
How many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 7?
Every 7th number is divisible by 7, so all of the numbers from 7 ×1 to 7×14 work.
We calculate this by seeing that100
7is a little more than 14 so 7 ×14 is the largest multiple
of 7 less than 100. Therefore, there from 1 to 100 are 14 numbers divisible by 7.
Are there any numbers overcounted between the multiples of 2 and the multiples
of 7?
74
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
For a number to be both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7, it must be a multiple of
7×2 = 14. Therefore, we are overcounting these numbers since we are counting them twice
as part of the multiples of 2 and multiples of 7.
How many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 14?
Every 14th number is divisible by 14, so all of the numbers from 14 ×1 to 14×7 work.
Therefore, from 1 to 100 there are 7 numbers divisible by 14.
Therefore, in total, the number of numbers that are multiple of 2 or 7 are the number
of multiples of 2 plus the number of multiples of 7 minus the multiples of 14.
This gives us an answer of 50 + 14 −7 = 57 .

Example 5.3 (Omega Learn)
How many subsets of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }have at most 4 even numbers
and at most 2 elements that are multiples of 3?
This is another problem we will solve using the principle of inclusion and exclusion and
the subsets formula we learned earlier.
Solution
How we can apply the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to this problem?
Notice how there are 5 even numbers, and we have to find how many subsets have at
75
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
most 4 even numbers. Similarly, there are 3 multiples of 3, and we have to find how many
elements have at most 2 multiples of 3.
We can see that there are fewer cases that don’t satisfy the condition, so it is better to use
complementary counting. We will first count the number of subsets that have more than 4
even numbers and have more than 2 multiple of 3.
First, how many subsets have more than 4 even numbers?
Since there are 5 multiples of 2 from 1 to 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), to have more than 4 multiples of
2 means having all of the multiples of 2 (only 1 way to choose this). From the remaining 5
numbers, there are 25possible subsets. Therefore, in total, there are 1 ×25= 25subsets that
have more than 4 multiples of 2.
Next, how many subsets have more than 2 multiples of 3?
Since there are 3 multiples of 3 from 1 to 10 (3, 6, 9), to have more than 2 multiples
of 3 means having all of the multiples of 3 (only 1 ways to choose this). From the remaining
7 numbers, there are 27possible subsets. By similar logic, in total, there will be 1 ×27= 27
possible subsets.
How many subsets are we overcounting that have all of the even numbers
and multiples of 3 from 1 to 10?
For a subset to have all the multiples of 2 and 3, it must contain all the elements from 2, 3, 4,
6, 8, 9, 10 (only 1 way to choose this). From the remaining 3 numbers, there are 1 ×23= 23
possible subsets.
Therefore, in total, the number of subsets that don’t satisfy our original condition is
27+ 25−23= 128 + 32−8 = 152.
The total number of possible subsets of the original set of 10 numbers is 210= 1024, so the
number of valid subsets is 1024 −152 = 872
Remark 5.0.5
When the number of cases that don’t work is much less than the number of cases that
do work, it can often be helpful to use complementary counting along with PIE.

is the set of all elements of Swhich are not in A.)
Solution
Let’s first find the number of ways to choose subsets so that Bis contained entirely in A.
How many ways are there to do this?
If we were just counting ways to choose a subset for A, there would be 26ways as each
element could go in or not in A. Let’s try to do something similar in this case.
As seen in the picture, there are 3 regions where the elements can end up: in AandB, inA
but notB, or not inAorB(equivalent to in S−A). Therefore, for each element, we have 3
choices so 36= 729 ways.
How many ways are there choose subsets so that Bis contained in S−A?
77
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
Like before, there are 3 regions: in S−AandB, inS−Abut notB, not inS−AorB
(equivalent to in A). Therefore, there are again 36= 729 ways.
How many cases are we overcounting?
For a case to be overcounted, Bmust be in both AandS−A. However, AandS−Aare
disjoint (they share no elements in common) so the only way for this to happen is if Bis
the empty set. Therefore, the number of overcounted cases is simply the number of ways to
chooseAwhich is 26= 64 asBis fixed.
By PIE, we have 2 ×729−64 = 1394 valid cases. In total, there are 26ways to pick
each ofAandBso the probability is1394
212=697
211giving an answer of 697 + 2 + 11 = 710 .
Theorem 5.0.6 (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion for 3 Sets)
Given three sets, |A1|,|A2|,|A3|,
|A1∪A2∪A3|=|A1|+|A2|+|A3|−|A1∩A2|−|A1∩A3|−|A2∩A3|+|A1∩A2∩A3|
In this formula, we count the number of possibilities in 3 ”things”, subtract the possibilities
that are duplicates in all 3 pairs of sets, and add back the number of duplicates in all 3
sets.
Example 5.6
How many numbers less than or equal to 193 are multiples of 2, 3, or 5?
Solution
78
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
First, let’s find how many numbers are divisible by 2, how many numbers are divisible by 3,
and how many numbers are divisible by 5.
Every 2nd number is divisible by 2, so all the numbers from 2 ×1 to 2×96 work. Therefore,
there are 96 numbers divisible by 2 less than or equal to 193
Every 3rd number is divisible by 3, so all the numbers from 3 ×1 to 3×64 work. Therefore,
there are 64 numbers divisible by 3 less than or equal to 193
Every 5th number is divisible by 5, so all the numbers from 5 ×1 to 5×38 work. Therefore,
there are 38 numbers divisible by 5 less than or equal to 193.
Next, we must subtract numbers divisible by two of the numbers 2, 3, or 5.
For this to happen, what values must the numbers be divisible by?
Numbers divisible by 2 and 3 or numbers divisible by 2 ×3 = 6 are counted twice. Similarly,
numbers divisible by 2 and 5 or 2 ×5 = 10 are counted twice and numbers divisible by 3 and
5 or 3×5 = 15 are counted twice. Therefore, we are overcounting multiples of each of 6, 10,
and 15, so we must subtract them.
Every 6th number is divisible by 6, so all the numbers from 6 ×1 to 6×32 work. Therefore,
there are 32 numbers divisible by 6 less than or equal to 193
Every 10th number is divisible by 10, so all the numbers from 10 ×1 to 10×19 work.
Therefore, there are 19 numbers divisible by 10 less than or equal to 193
Every 15th number is divisible by 5, so all the numbers from 15 ×1 to 15×12 work. Therefore,
there are 12 numbers divisible by 15 less than or equal to 193.
If we subtract the overcounted numbers above, did we remove too much?
Next, we look at how many times multiples of 2, 3, and 5, or multiples of 2 ×3×5 = 30
were counted. Well, they were originally counted 3 times as part of the multiples of 2, 3, and
5. Then, they were subtracted 3 times as part of the multiples of 6, 10, and 15. Therefore,
they have been counted 0 times! But, we need to count them exactly once, so we must add
back the number of multiples of 2 ×3×5 = 30.
Every 30th number is divisible by 30, so all the numbers from 30 ×1 to 30×6 work.
Therefore, there are 6 numbers divisible by 30 less than or equal to 193
In total, to find the number of multiples of 2, 3, or 5 we have to add the number of
multiples of 2, the number of multiples of 3, the number of multiples of 5. Then, we have
to subtract the number of multiples of 6, 10, and 15. And finally, we have to add back the
79
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
number of multiples of 30.
This gives us an answer of 96 + 64 + 38 −32−19−12 + 6 = 141 .

80
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
Solution
Since we are asked to find the probability the grid does not have red 2 ×2 square, it’s a good
idea to use complementary counting and find how many colorings have at least 1 2x2 red
2×2 square.
Amongst all choices of a red 2x2 square, how many colorings exist?
There are four 2×2 squares as shown above. Then, there are 25ways to color the rest of the
squares red or blue giving a total of 4 ×32 = 128. However, we are overcounting possibilities
when there are 2 red 2x2 squares.
Amongst all choices of 2 red 2x2 squares, how many colorings exist?
There are 4 cases as shown above. In the 4 cases on the top, there are 3 remaining squares
giving 23possibilities. In the 2 cases on the right, there are 2 remaining squares giving
22possibilities. In total, we have 4 ×23+ 2×22= 40. However, we are undercounting
possibilities when there are 3 red 2x2 squares.
Amongst all choices of 3 red 2×2squares, how many colorings exist?
In each of the 4 cases shown above, there is 1 remaining square which has 2 choices so in
total, there are 4×21= 8 ways in this case. We are overcounting possibilities when there are
4 red 2x2 squares.
81
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 5. Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
There is simply 1 way to color the grid in this case.
Summing everything up, we get 128 −40 + 8−1 = 95 configurations with a red 2 ×2
square. By complementary counting, there are 29−95 = 417 configurations without such a
square giving a probability of417
512so the answer is 417 + 512 = 929 .

6.1 Stars and Bars Fundamentals
Example 6.1
How many ways are there to distribute 8 identical computers amongst 3 students?
Solution
Make sure to keep in mind that the computers are identical. If the computers were not
identical, then we would just have 3 choices for each computer, so our answer would just be 38.
However, when the computers are identical, only the number of computers each student has
matters. To start, let’s say we have 8 computers in a line: CCCCCCCC. Therefore, we must
divide these computers amongst 3 students.
How can we represent the 8 computers being divided amongst the 3 students?
We can think about having 3 groups. We can simply let the leftmost group be for stu-
dent one, the middle group for student 2, and the rightmost group for student 3 because only
the number of computers each student has matters, so ordering is irrelevant.
How can we divide the 8 C’s amongst 3 groups?
We can do this by just placing 2 bars somewhere in between the 8 C’s! Everything left of the
first bar goes to student 1, everything in the middle goes to student 2, and everything to
the right of the 2nd bar goes to student 3. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the
computers is simply the number of ways to insert 2 bars in between 8 C’s. Examples:
CC|CCCCC|C- 2 for student 1, 5 for student 2, 1 for student 3
|CCCC|CCCC - 0 for student 1, 4 for student 2, 4 for student 3
C|CCCCCCC|- 1 for student 1, 7 for student 2, 0 for student 3
CCCCCCCC||- 8 for student 1, 0 for student 2, 0 for student 3
How do we find the number of ways to insert 2 bars in between 8 C’s?
We can think of having 10 slots (each slot for either a bar or a C). Then, we can choose 2 of
these slots for bars.
Therefore, the numbers of ways to select two slots out of the 10 slots (i.e. choose two
slots to put the two bars out of the 10 slots) is

The number of ways to place nidentical objects into kdistinguishable bins is

Remark 6.1.2
Stars and Bars is very useful, and can often be adapted based on situations. For example,
if each bin has to have at least 1 object in it we assign 1 object to each bin to start off,
and apply our formula to the remaining n−kobjects and kdistinguishable bins.

6.2 Stars and Bars With Constraints
Concept 6.2.1
Stars and bars is extremely useful, and can often be adapted based on situations. For
example, if each bin has to have at least 1 object in it we assign each bin 1 object to
start off with and apply our formula with n−kobjects and kdistinguishable bins.
Example 6.2
7 astronauts are stranded in space with only 10 identical meals left. Every astronaut
must receive at least 1 meal or else, they will starve. How many ways are there to
distribute meals under this constraint?
Solution
This problem is very similar to the previous problem, except we now have an additional
constraint, so the formula won’t work. Let’s focus on the constraint, since it’s the most
complicated part of the problem.
How can we deal with the condition that every astronaut must get at least 1 meal?
If every astronaut must receive at least 1 meal and all the meals are identical, we can
simply pre-distribute 7 of the meals and give 1 to each astronaut. Notice that now, no matter
where the remaining meals are distributed, every astronaut will get 1 meal or more.
Now, how can we use stars on bars on the remaining problem?
After 7 meals are distributed, only 3 remain. There is no constraint on who these 3 meals
can go to, so it can go to any of the 7 astronauts. To divide these 3 meals into 7 groups, we
can place 6 bars in between the 3 meals. Then, out of the 3+6=9 slots for meals and bars,
we must choose 6 of them for bars.
We can do this in/parenleftig9

Video Solution
Example 6.4
What’s the probability that the sum of the top faces on five regular 6-sided dice is 24?
Solution
Before we begin, note that each dice must be a value from 1 to 6. There is no way to use
stars and bars directly because it will not account for the constraint that the maximum of
each dice roll is a 6.
How can we use stars and bars for this problem?
Let the default for each dice be a 6. Then the maximum score is 30, we must essen-
tially distribute 6 negatives to the 5 dice (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1).
We can see that to distribute 6 negatives to 5 dice, we must have 4 bars to separate the
negatives into 5 groups for the dice. We then have 10 slots and must choose 4 of them for
bars. We can do this in/parenleftig10
4/parenrightig
= 210 ways.
Are there any cases we are overcounting?
Because the minimum value of a dice roll is 1, each dice can only take at most 5 nega-
tives. Therefore, we are overcounting the possibilities where 1 dice receives 6 negatives.
How many ways are there for 1 dice to have 6 negatives?
There are 5 dice, so there are 5 choices for which dice will have all 6 negatives. From
here, we can calculate our final answer by subtracting the 5 ways that result in 1 dice
receiving all 6 negatives from/parenleftig10
4/parenrightig
. This gives us our answer, the number of ways to distribute
6 negatives to 5 dice so that no dice gets more than 5 negatives.
The answer is/parenleftig10

6.4 Stars and Bars to Count Orderings
Example 6.8
How many ways are there for 7 people to sit in a line if 3 of them are enemies and refuse
to sit next to each other?
Solution
We will worry about the ordering about the 3 enemies and remaining 4 people later. For now,
let’s find the number of possible ways to choose 3 locations for the 7 enemies.
Without the condition, how many ways are there to do this?
There are 7 possible locations and the enemies must sit at 3 of them so/parenleftig7
3/parenrightig
.
What must happen so that the enemies don’t sit next to each other?
There must be at least 1 other person between each of the enemies.
Letwbe the number of people left of the 1st enemy, let xbe the number of people between
the 1st and 2nd enemies, let ybe the number of people between the 2nd and 3rd enemies,
and letzbe the number of people right of the 3rd enemy.
What conditions must w,x,y,z satisfy?
Firstly, since there are 4 people who are not enemies, we must have w+x+y+z= 4.
However, by our observation earlier, xandymust be at least 1.
How can we use stars and bars to find the number of solutions to this equation?
We start by assigning 1 star to xandy. Then, there are/parenleftig5
3/parenrightig
solutions by stars and bars.
How many orderings of the enemies and non-enemies are possible?
There are 3! ways to order the enemies and 4! ways to order the other people so our
answer is/parenleftig5

Example 6.9 (AIME)
Ed has five identical green marbles, and a large supply of identical red marbles. He
arranges the green marbles and some of the red ones in a row and finds that the number
of marbles whose right hand neighbor is the same color as themselves is equal to the
number of marbles whose right hand neighbor is the other color. An example of such
an arrangement is GGRRRGGRG. Let mbe the maximum number of red marbles for
which such an arrangement is possible, and let Nbe the number of ways he can arrange
them+ 5 marbles to satisfy the requirement. Find the remainder when Nis divided by
1000.
Solution
At most how many marbles can have a different colored right neighbor?
From the 5 red marbles, for the right marble to be a different color, it must be green.
Therefore, at most 5 red marbles can have a different colored right neighbor. For the mgreen
marbles, for the right marble to be a different color it must be red and since there are 5 red mar-
bles, at most 5 green marbles can have a different colored right neighbor. In total, we have 10.
From this, what is the maximum value of m, the total number of green marbles?
If there are an equal number of different colored and same colored right neighbors, there are
at most a total of 20 right neighbors. This means there can be at most 21 total marbles or
16 green marbles.
What must happen so the condition is satisfied with 5 red and 16 green marbles?
As discovered earlier, each red marble must be surrounded by a green marble on both
the right and left sides in order for each red marble to have a green marble to it’s right and
each green marble to have a red marble to it’s right.
How many ways are there to do this?
This is similar to the previous problem. We are dividing the 16 green marbles into 6
groups. However, in order for red marbles to have green marble neighbors on both sides,
there must be at least 1 green marble in each group. After assigning 1 green marble to each
group, we have 10 green marbles left to distribute amongst 6 groups. We can do this in/parenleftig15
5/parenrightig
= 2 003 ways.

Example 6.10 (AIME)
There are two distinguishable flagpoles, and there are 19 flags, of which 10 are identical
blue flags, and 9 are identical green flags. Let Nbe the number of distinguishable
arrangements using all of the flags in which each flagpole has at least one flag and no two
green flags on either pole are adjacent. Find the remainder when Nis divided by 1000.
Solution
We will do complementary counting and first find the total number of flag configurations and
then subtract off the possibilities where all the flags are on 1 pole. We will first find how
many cases must be subtracted off.
How many ways are possible to put the 19 flags on 1 flagpole?
There are 9 green flags and we much distribute the 10 blue flags such that there is at
least 1 blue flag between each green flag. We assign 8 blue flags to place in between the green
flags and distribute the remaining 2 blue flags amongst the 10 possible locations by stars and
bars giving/parenleftig11
2/parenrightig
. We will multiply this by 2 as there are 2 possible flagpoles where all of the
flags can be on.
For the 2 flagpole case, how can we try and combine the flagpoles to make
it into a scenario similar to the previous one?
Imagine taking all the flags from 1st flagpole and all of the flags from the 2nd flagpole
and placing them on a third flagpole. Between the 2 flagpoles, place a red flag to distinguish
the flags between the 2 poles.
If there are no consecutive green flags on the original 2 flag poles, what must be
true about the green flags on the 3rd flag pole?
Like earlier, no 2 green flags can be consecutive. However, we can also separate the green flags
with a red flag! As seen in the diagram above, this corresponds to when there is a green flag
on bottom of the first flagpole and a green flag on the top of the 2nd flagpole, which is allowed!
95
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 6. Stars & Bars
Using the same stars and bars argument, how many ways are there to place the
blue and red flags in between the 9 green flags?
There are 10 regions around the green flags to place them in and 11 flags to place in
these groups. The middle 8 groups require a flag so we have to distribute the remaining 3
flags amongst the 10 groups. By stars and bars, this is/parenleftig12

. However, out of all the flags
that are either red or blue, we must choose 1 of them to be blue.

Example 7.3 (AIME Modified)
Melinda has ten empty boxes and 75 textbooks, three of which are mathematics textbooks.
The first box holds 3 textbooks, the 2nd box holds 4 textbooks, the 3rd box holds 5
textbooks, all the way until the 8th box with holds 10 textbooks. If Melinda packs her
textbooks into these boxes in random order, the probability that all three mathematics
textbooks end up in the same box can be written asm

Solution
Among the 75 book slots, we must choose 3 of them to be math textbooks.
How many ways are there to do this?

Next, let’s find the number of ways each box can hold the 3 math textbooks.
How many ways can the first box hold the math books? 2nd box? 10th box?
The first box has only/parenleftig3

Remark 7.3.6
Imagine how tedious that would be to add if we had to do it manually!
Example 7.4 (AIME)
Consider all 1000-element subsets of the set {1,2,3,...,2015}. From each such subset
choose the least element. The arithmetic mean of all of these least elements isp
q, where
pandqare relatively prime positive integers. Find p+q.
Solution
To find the average value of the least elements over all subsets, let’s first find the sum of the
least elements across all subsets. To do this, we will find the number of subsets with each
element as it’s least element.
How many subsets have 1 as a least element?
We must choose 999 more elements from the 2014 remaining elements, which can be done in/parenleftig2014
999/parenrightig
ways.
How many subsets have 2 as a least element? 3? 4? 1016?
For 2 to be the least element, we must choose 999 elements from the 2013 remaining
elements so/parenleftig2013
999/parenrightig
. By similar logic, there are/parenleftig2012
999/parenrightig
ways 3 can be the least element. This
continues all the way until 1016 which has/parenleftig999
999/parenrightig
it can be the least element.
Based on this, what is the total sum of least elements across all the sets?
We get
1×/parenleftigg2014
999/parenrightigg
+ 2×/parenleftigg2013
999/parenrightigg
+···+ 1016×/parenleftigg999
999/parenrightigg
. This reminds us of the hockey stick identity. However, the coefficients make it so that we
can’t apply it directly.
How can we divide the sum so that we can apply the hockey stick identity?
By the Hockey Stick Identity,
/parenleftigg2014
999/parenrightigg
+/parenleftigg2013
999/parenrightigg

999/parenrightigg
=/parenleftigg2015
1000/parenrightigg
110
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 7. Combinatorial Identities
.
After subtracting this from our original sum, what are we left with?
We are left with
1×/parenleftigg2013
999/parenrightigg
+···+ 1015×/parenleftigg999
999/parenrightigg
. By Hockey Stick Identity again, we find
/parenleftigg2013

+ 1×/parenleftigg2013
999/parenrightigg
+···+ 1×/parenleftigg999
999/parenrightigg
=/parenleftigg2014
1000/parenrightigg
. We can again subtract this from our original sum.
As shown above, we can continue this logic! We end up with/parenleftig2015
1000/parenrightig

1000/parenrightig
+···+/parenleftig1000
1000/parenrightig
=/parenleftig2016
1001/parenrightig
by Hockey Stick Identity again.
There are/parenleftig2015
1000/parenrightig
possible subsets so to find the average value we divide(2016

(2015

8.1 Triangle Counting
Example 8.1
How many triangles can be formed by connecting vertices in a regular octagon?
Solution
You could solve this by casework on what type of triangle you will select. However, there is a
very smart and clever solution.
How many vertices defines a triangle?
This seems like a silly question, obviously 3.
How many ways are there to select 3 vertices from an octagon?
Since an octagon has 8 vertices, this will just be/parenleftig8
3/parenrightig
.
Do all combinations of 3 vertices form a triangle?
This is a very important question to ask because it’s not always true. For example, if
3 points are collinear (you can draw a line through all 3 of them) then the answer would
actually be no, and we would have to subtract the extra cases. Luckily, in an octagon, no 3
points are collinear, so all combinations of 3 vertices do indeed form a triangle.
Therefore, our answer is just

8.2 Rectangle Counting
Example 8.4
How many rectangles are in a 3x5 grid of rectangles?
Solution
This is another problem that can be solved by tedious casework but has a very slick solution.
What defines a rectangle in a grid?
4 points? Not quite because 4 points don’t necessarily make a rectangle. 2 vertical lines and
2 horizontal lines define a rectangle as shown in the picture below. In other words, any 2
vertical lines and horizontal lines in this grid will form a rectangle.
How can we count the number of rectangles in a grid based on this?
We simply have to choose 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines!
There are 4 horizontal lines, so there are/parenleftig4
2/parenrightig
ways to select 2 horizontal lines that de-
fine a rectangle. Similarly, there are 6 vertical lines, so there are/parenleftig6
2/parenrightig

lines that define a rectangle.

8.4 Path Counting
Example 8.11
A rabbit is walking in a coordinate plane and has to get from (0,0) to the carrot at the
point (5,5). If the rabbit can only move 1 unit up or 1 unit right on any given move,
how many ways are there for the rabbit to get to the carrot?
Solution
This is yet another problem that is tedious to solve with casework. Instead, let’s find a
simpler way to solve this problem. Lets denote a right move by R and an up move by U.
How many right and up moves does the rabbit need to get to the carrot?
Because it’s going from (0,0) to (5,5), it needs 5 right moves and 5 up moves. Therefore,
we just need to count the number of ways to make 5 right moves and 5 up moves in any order.
How can we represent the number of ways to make 5 right moves and 5 up
moves (in any order)?
This can be thought of as rearrangements of 5 R and 5 U: RRRRRUUUUU. We just
need to find all possible rearrangements of this word. Given the total number of characters
is 10, and counting the duplicates (5 R’s and 5 U’s), we can use the word rearrangement
formula:10!
5!×5!= 252
Theorem 8.4.1
The number of ways to get from (0,0) to a point (m,n) moving only up and right is
/parenleftiggm+n

3 locations?

Compute the number of colorings for which Sam is guaranteed to pass through a total of
exactly 3 red cells, exactly 3 white cells, and exactly 3 blue cells no matter which route
he takes.
Solution
How must the grid be colored so that the condition is satisfied?
124
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Geometric Counting
A possible diagram is shown below.
How can use the fact that every path goes through the same colors?
We can construct 2 paths that are nearly identical and perhaps find some squares that
must be the same color. Consider the 2 paths shown below.
They are the same except for 2 steps (green and pink). Both of those paths must pass through
3 blue, 3 red, and 3 white squares. However, because they pass through the same colored
squares for the 8 squares their paths share, squares AandBmust be the same color.
Why does this imply each diagonal must be colored the same color throughout?
We can apply the same logic: constructing 2 nearly identical paths that differ by an adjacent
diagonal square for all diagonally adjacent squares. This gives us that all the squares in a
diagonal must be the same color.
Now, the problem is equivalent to choosing 3 of the 9 diagonals to be each of red, white, and
blue.

8.5 Polyhedrons
Concept 8.5.1
In a polyhedron, if you add up the number of sides on every face, you will get 2 times
the number of edges of the polyhedron. This is due to each edge of the polyhedron being
part of 2 faces.
If you add up the number of edges connected to every vertex, you will get 2 times
the number of edges of the polyhedron as well since each edge is counted as part of 2
different vertices.
For example, a cube has 4 sides per face and 6 faces so it has4×6
2= 12 edges. Also, there
are 3 edges per vertex and 8 vertices so there are3×8
2= 12 edges.
Theorem 8.5.2 (Euler’s Polyhedron Formula)
Edges = Faces + Vertices - 2
E = F + V - 2
126
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Geometric Counting
Remark 8.5.3
If you ever forget this theorem, just think of a cube and remember that it has 6 faces, 8
vertices, and 12 edges.
Remark 8.5.4
A classic application of this: If you have a polyhedron with 12 hexagonal faces and 10
pentagonal faces, how many vertices are there in the polygon? To do this, simply find
the number of faces (22), the number of edges
12×6 + 10×5
2
(we divide by 2 since each edge is counted as part of 2 faces). Finally, apply Euler’s
Polyhedron Formula to find the number of vertices
Example 8.16 (AMC 12)
A convex polyhedron Qhas vertices V1,V2,...,Vn, and 100 edges. The polyhedron is
cut by planes P1,P2,...,Pnin such a way that plane Pkcuts only those edges that meet
at vertexVk. In addition, no two planes intersect inside or on Q. The cuts produce n
pyramids and a new polyhedron R. How many edges does Rhave?
Solution
Take a look at the image below if you are confused about what this question is saying.
Essentially, we are cutting off every corner of the polyhedron.
According to Euler’s Polyhedron Formula, how many faces the original polyhe-
dron have?
127
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Geometric Counting
The theorem states F=E−V+ 2 so there are 100 −n+ 2 = 102−nfaces originally.
Every time we cut off a corner, how many new faces are added?
As seen in the image above, every corner that is cut adds 1 additional face. Since there are
ncorners, we cut ntimes and add nfaces to the polyhedron giving 102 faces for the new
polyhedron R.
How many vertices are in the new polyhedron?
Every edge is cut twice: once for every vertex that it’s connected to. Each of these cuts
corresponds to a vertex of the new polyhedron. (If you don’t see why, see the image below of
a cube with all corners cut off)
Therefore, for each of the 100 original edges, there will be 2 vertices in the new polyhedron
giving a total of 200 vertices.
Using Euler’s Polyhedron Formula again, how many edges must there be in
the new polyhedron?
We haveE=V+F−2 = 200 + 102−2 = 300 .

SquareABCD in the coordinate plane has vertices at the points A(1,1),B(−1,1),C(−1,−1),

•L,a rotation of 90◦counterclockwise around the origin;
•R,a rotation of 90◦clockwise around the origin;
133
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 8. Geometric Counting
•H,a reflection across the x-axis; and
•V,a reflection across the y-axis.
Each of these transformations maps the squares onto itself, but the positions of the
labeled vertices will change. For example, applying Rand thenVwould send the vertex
Aat (1,1) to (−1,−1) and would send the vertex Bat (−1,1) to itself. How many
sequences of 20 transformations chosen from {L,R,H,V}will send all of the labeled
vertices back to their original positions? (For example, R,R,V,H is one sequence of 4
transformations that will send the vertices back to their original positions.)
Hints
8.6.8 Suppose the inside triangle is red. Consider cases on how many of the outside triangles
are red.
8.6.9 For the most part, all rotations must cancel out with each other and all reflections
must cancel out with each other. However, 2 rotations clockwise can be undone by a x-axis
reflection and y-axis reflection.
For each choice of the first 19 moves, there is always 1 final move that works. To see
this, look at the possible configurations after 18 moves: either it’s the same as the origi-
nal configuration, rotated by 180 degrees, or is 1 rotation and 1 reflection of the original
configuration.

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 9. Geometric Probability
Definition 9.0.1. Geometric probability is a way to calculate probability by measuring the
number of outcomes geometrically, in terms of length, area, or volume. The key to solving
geometric probability is
1.Try a few examples for the different cases, make sure to always mark the extreme cases
2. Try to figure out the region the shape maps out
3. Use geometry to find the area of this region
Remark 9.0.2
Geometric probability can be useful when the number of possible outcomes is infinite.
Example 9.1
Alex and Bob arrive at a random time from 3 PM to 4 PM. They will each wait for 15
minutes before leaving. What is the probability that they will meet?
Solution
What must happen for the 2 people to meet?
Alex and Bob’s arrival time must be within 15 minutes of each other. In other words,
Alex can not arrive more than 15 minutes after Bob and Bob can not arrive more than 15
minutes after Alex.
If Alex arrives at 3, when can Bob arrive?
Alex will wait 15 minutes so Bob must arrive by 3:15.
If Alex arrives at 3:15, when can Bob arrive?
In order to be within 15 minutes of Alex’s time, Bob must arrive between 3 and 3:30.
If Alex arrives at 3:30, when can Bob arrive? 3:45? 4?
If Alex arrives at 3:30, Bob must arrive from 3:15 to 3:45. If Alex arrives at 3:45, Bob
must arrive from 3:30 to 4. If Alex arrives at 4, Bob must arrive from 3:45 to 4.
137
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 9. Geometric Probability
Using this, we draw a picture. The x-axis represents Alex’s arrival time and the y-axis
represents Bob’s arrival time. Black rectangles are shown for the 4 cases discussed and try to
find the area of the region where they meet.
How can we generalize this for all possible arrival times for Alex?
The green line denotes the points where Bob arrives at the same time as Alex. As dis-
cussed, Bob can arrive up to 15 minutes before or after.
We then construct the blue region as shown showing all possible valid regions.
If the side length of the square is 1, what is the area of the blue region?
To do this, we will subtract off the areas of the 2 red triangles. Each of them has an
area of1
2×3
4×3
4=9
32giving a total area of9
16. Therefore, the area of the blue region is7
16
and since the area of the square is 1 (represents total probability), this is also the probability
they will meet.

Solution
We break this into 3 cases:
Case 1: 2 points on the same side
There is1
4chance that the 2nd point is on the same side as the 1st point, so this case
has a1
4chance of happening. Let xandybe the distances of those 2 points from a vertex.
The difference between xandymust be bigger than1
2.
How can we find the probability this happens?
We can use our standard geometric probability argument.
The area of the blue region shown represents the values of xandythat work. It has
an area of 2×1
2×(1
2)2=1
4which means the probability our condition is satisfied in this case is1
4.
Case 2: 2 points on adjacent sides
Out of 4 possible sides, 2 sides for the 2nd point result in it being on an adjacent side
to the 1st point giving us a probability of1
2that this case happens.
Letxandybe the distances between the 2 points to a common vertex.
What must be true about xandy?
By the pythagorean theorem, we must have√x2+y2≥1

How can we find the area of points that satisfy this region?
This is the equation for a circle! Therefore, all points above the quarter circle shown
will work as shown. The quarter circle’s area is1
4×(1
2)2π=π
16. The area of the blue region
that works (and thus the probability the points are more than1
2away from each in other) is
1−π
16in this case.
Case 3: 2 points on opposite sides
141
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 9. Geometric Probability
Out of 4 possible sides for the 2nd point, only 1 will result in it being on an opposite
side. Therefore, the probability this case happens is1
4.
Why are the points always more than1
2away in this case?
As shown, the distance between the 2 points will always be greater than 1 and thus1

by the pythagorean theorem.
In total, we have that the probability is1

Definition 10.0.1. Expected value is the weighted average of outcomes.
Theorem 10.0.2 (Expected Value)
The expected value of some event Xis
/summationdisplay
xi·P(xi)
wherexiare the possible values of XandP(xi) is the probability they occur.
Basically the expected value is just the weighted sum of probabilities of events
Remark 10.0.3
Often times, in finding the expected value, we can just look for symmetry instead
of summing each individual probability times number. For example, to calculate the
expected value of a dice roll rather than evaluating
1
6·1 +1
6·2 +1
6·3 +1
6·4 +1
6·5 +1
6·6 = 3.5
we can see that since all rolls from 1 to 6 are equally likely, the expected value is just
the average roll which is just the average of the 2 middle terms which is 3 .5. (See the
arithmetic sequences section)
147
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 10. Expected Value
Theorem 10.0.4 (Linearity of Expectation)
For independent or dependent events,
E(x1+x2+···+xn) =Ex1+Ex2+···+Exn
Basically, what this means is that the total expected value of n events is just the sum of
the expected values of each individual event.
Remark 10.0.5
This theorem is super powerful! It allows us to find the expected value of the individual
events rather than of the whole thing at once.

Solution
We will use linearity of expectation.
How many places are there where a boy and girl could be standing next to
each other?
There 19 places: 1st and 2nd spots, 2nd and 3rd spots, ..., 19th and 20th spots.

At any given location the probability, a boy and girl are standing next to each other is

I have a calculator with 4 buttons: 1, 2, +, −. Initially, I randomly press one of the four
buttons and from there, I alternate between pressing a number and an operation. If I
press the button a total of 100 times, what is the expected value of the output?
Solution
An astonishing expected value problem to close the chapter!
We can ignore all the numbers after the first operation button is pressed. Why?
0 In every scenario where than can be a +, there can be a −and vice versa.
For example, if our sequence of presses were 1 + 1 −2 + 1 + 2−2..., then we could
reverse all the operations to get 1 −1 + 2−1−2 + 2....
Notice that the average of these values is simply the first number, 1 as everything else
cancels out. In general, we only have to consider the expected value of the number (if any)
before the first operation. The rest of the expression, on average, is 0.
There is a1
2chance of an operation being pushed first which has an expected output
of 0. There is1

an operation so the expected value in this case is1+2

is the expected number of valid squares that the bishop can move to (in one move) equal
to the expected number of squares that the knight can move to (in one move)?

10.1.6 The expected number of squares the knight can visit is straightforward (8(1 −p)).
Consider the 4 diagonals emanating from the bishop. For a square diagonally adjacent to the
bishop, it has a probability of 1 −pof being visitable. For a square 2 away diagonally from
the bishop, it has a probability of (1 −p)2of being visitable. (why?) Continue this logic and

11.1 Recursion Fundamentals
Definition 11.1.1. Recursion is the process of finding smaller values and using them to
calculate larger values.
Example 11.1
Jeff is climbing a 6 stair staircase. If he can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time, in how many
distinct ways can he get to the top?
Solution
We could do casework, but that would take a long time. Instead, let’s solve this problem for
small values first.
How many ways are there for Jeff to reach the 0th stair (ground)?
Jeff is already there at the start, so there is just 1 way to do that.
How many ways are there for Jeff to reach the 1st stair?
There is only 1 way because he must climb 1 step to reach there from the ground (0th
stair).
How many ways are there for Jeff to reach the 2nd stair?
There are 2 ways: 2 single steps or 1 double step from ground (0th stair)
How can Jeff reach the 3rd stair?
Jeff either has to take a single step from the 2nd stair, or a double step from the 1st
stair. Therefore, the number of ways is simply the number of ways to reach the first step
plus the number of ways to reach the 2nd step, which is 1 + 2 = 3.
How can use the same logic to find the number of ways to reach the nth stair?
To reach the nth stair, Jeff must take a 1 step from the ( n−1)th stair or a double step
from the (n−2)th stair. Therefore, the number of ways of reaching the nth step is the
number of ways of reaching the ( n−1)th plus the number of ways of reaching the ( n−2)th stair.
Let’s define a function, f(n), such that f(n) represents the number of ways to reach the
155
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 11. Recursion
nth step. Then, we can write the recursion
f(n) =f(n−1) +f(n−2)
.
The next step is to just iteratively calculate the values of f(n) for all values of n until we
findf(6), since the staircase has 6 steps. We already calculated f(1) andf(2) so we can use
them as base cases.
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(3) =f(3−1) +f(3−2) =f(2) +f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
f(4) =f(4−1) +f(4−2) =f(3) +f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5
f(5) =f(5−1) +f(5−2) =f(4) +f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8
f(6) =f(6−1) +f(6−2) =f(5) +f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13
Remark 11.1.2
Notice how the numbers follow the Fibonacci sequence. This is because the recursions
for our sequence and the Fibonacci sequence are the same. However, this is not always
the case for all recursion problems.
Remark 11.1.3
Note that you can get the answer to many recursion problems by using engineering
induction (see the meta-solving section).
11.2 Recursion with Constraints
Concept 11.2.1
To solve a problem with recursion requires a multi-step process:
1. Solve the problem for a few smaller base cases manually
2.In general, you will need as many base cases as the number of terms on the right
hand side of your recursive function
3.For a given f(n), figure out a recursive equation in terms of previous values of the
function by considering different ways to get to that point
4. Iteratively calculate values of f(n) until you reach the desired number
156
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 11. Recursion
Remark 11.2.2
You can also use f(0) = 1 as a base case because to get to the 0th stair, you have to take
no steps and there is only 1 way to do so. This can be a little faster, however it could be
a little confusing, so it won’t be used in the examples. Nevertheless, feel free to use it in
the problems section.
Example 11.2
Mike is climbing a staircase with 10 stairs. He is in a rush, so he will climb 2 or 3 steps
at a time for most of the journey. If he reaches the 9th stair, he is allowed to climb 1
stair to reach the 10th stair. How many ways are there for Mike to reach the top of the
staircase?
Solution
We can do a similar approach to the previous problem. We first begin by finding the base
cases.
There is no way to reach the 1st stair since he cannot take a 1 step, so f(1) = 0.
There is 1 way to reach the 2nd stair by taking a double step, so f(2) = 1.
There is 1 way to reach the 3rd stair by taking a triple step. If the first step is a double step,
then it’s impossible to reach the 3rd stair since there are no single steps. Therefore, f(3) = 1.
Next, what is the recursive function for this problem?
To get the the nth stair, we must either take a 2 step from the ( n−2)th stair or a 3
step from the ( n−3)th stair. So, the recursion is
f(n) =f(n−2) +f(n−3)
Let’s now evaluate the values of f(n)
f(1) = 0
f(2) = 1
f(3) = 1
f(4) =f(4−2) +f(4−3) =f(2) +f(1) = 1
f(5) =f(5−2) +f(5−3) =f(3) +f(2) = 2
f(6) =f(6−2) +f(6−3) =f(4) +f(3) = 2
f(7) =f(7−2) +f(7−3) =f(5) +f(4) = 3
f(8) =f(8−2) +f(8−3) =f(6) +f(5) = 4
f(9) =f(9−2) +f(9−3) =f(7) +f(6) = 5
f(10) =f(10−2) +f(10−3) =f(8) +f(7) = 7
157
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 11. Recursion
So, is our answer just f(10) = 7 ?
No, because once he reaches stair 9, he is allowed to take a single step. So, we must
add the number of ways to reach stair 9 to the number of ways to reach stair 8 and the
number of ways to reach stair 7. Therefore, we must find:
f(10) =f(8) +f(7) +f(9) = 12
Remark 11.2.3
In general, it never hurts to find too many base cases. In your recursion, if you run into
any values you are not sure how to calculate (like f(2), f(3)), you can always go back and
evaluate more base cases.
11.3 More Complex Recursions
Example 11.3 (AIME)
A collection of 8 cubes consists of one cube with edge-length kfor each integer k,1≤
k≤8.A tower is to be built using all 8 cubes according to the rules:

To check if your recursive equation is correct, try evaluating a few manually and seeing

Often, it may be simpler to define 2 recursive functions (say a(n) andb(n)) where the
actual answer is some combination of the 2 functions.
Example 11.5 (AIME 2001)
A mail carrier delivers mail to the nineteen houses on the east side of Elm Street. The
carrier notices that no two adjacent houses ever get mail on the same day, but that there
are never more than two houses in a row that get no mail on the same day. How many
different patterns of mail delivery are possible?
Solution
Leta(n) be the number of mail delivery patterns with nhouses and the last house getting
mail andb(n) be the number of mail delivery patterns with nhouses and the last house not
getting mail. Our goal is to find a(19) +b(19).
What recursive equations can we develop for each function?
Fora(n), since the last house gets mail, the house before must not get mail. The number of
mail delivery patterns for the first n−1 houses that end with a house not getting mail is
b(n−1) soa(n) =b(n−1).
Forb(n), since the last house does not get mail, either house n−1 orn−2 must get
mail. Therefore, b(n) =a(n−1) +a(n−2).
We can combine our equations so that we have b(n) =a(n−1)+a(n−2) =b(n−2)+b(n−3)
sincea(n−1) =b(n−2) anda(n−2) =b(n−3). This is not necessary but will help make the
calculations a bit easier as now we only have to find the values of b(n) and we can substitute
to finda(19) =b(18) at the end.
How many mail delivery patterns are there with 1 house and the last house
getting mail? 2 houses? 3 houses?
159
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 11. Recursion
For one house, there is clearly 1 pattern so b(1) = 1. For 2 houses, the first house must not
have mail so the 2nd house can either have mail or not have mail so b(2) = 2. For 3 houses,
if the second house has mail, then the first house doesn’t have mail, and if the 2nd house has
mail, then the first house doesn’t have mail giving 2 ways in total and b(3) = 2.
Using these base cases, we do a straightforward computation with the equation b(n) =
b(n−2) +b(n−3) repeatedly. (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, 65, 86, 114, 141,
200)
We get that a(19) +b(19) =b(18) +b(19) = 141 + 200 = 341 .

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 12. Probability States
Concept 12.0.1 (States)
We use states in problems when we are trying to find the probability of ”a win” from
different positions or turns
When encountering states problems we use the following steps
1. Assign variables to the probabilities of winning from the different positions
2.Write your equations for the probability of winning from each of these positions in
terms of the other states
3. Solve your system of equations
Concept 12.0.2 (Symmetry in States)
Always be on the lookout for symmetry in states problems (positions where you have an
equal probability of winning from) to help simplify your equations.
Remark 12.0.3
Often times in state problems when you have a lot of states, you may have to write a
state recursion equation.

Example 12.1 (AMC 12)
Tom, Dick, and Harry are playing a game. Starting at the same time, each of them flips
a fair coin repeatedly until he gets his first head, at which point he stops. What is the
probability that all three flip their coins the same number of times?
Video Solution
Example 12.2 (AMC 10)
Frieda the frog begins a sequence of hops on a 3 ×3 grid of squares, moving one square
on each hop and choosing at random the direction of each hop-up, down, left, or right.
She does not hop diagonally. When the direction of a hop would take Frieda off the grid,
she ”wraps around” and jumps to the opposite edge. For example if Frieda begins in the
center square and makes two hops ”up”, the first hop would place her in the top row
middle square, and the second hop would cause Frieda to jump to the opposite edge,
landing in the bottom row middle square. Suppose Frieda starts from the center square,
makes at most four hops at random, and stops hopping if she lands on a corner square.
What is the probability that she reaches a corner square on one of the four hops?

12.1 States with Recursion
Concept 12.1.1
For states recursions, it can be a good idea to simply make a table and find the probability
of being at each location at every time interval. Remember to use the fact that the total
probability at each hop must always be 1.
Remark 12.1.2
Having recursive equations along with states is useful when you have questions like,
”After 10 moves, what is the probability of being on point A?”
Example 12.3 (AMC)
A cricket randomly hops between 4 leaves, on each turn hopping to one of the other 3
leaves with equal probability. After 4 hops what is the probability that the cricket has
returned to the leaf where it started?
Video Solution
Example 12.4 (AMC 10)
Raashan, Sylvia, and Ted play the following game. Each starts with $1. A bell rings every
15 seconds, at which time each of the players who currently have money simultaneously
chooses one of the other two players independently and at random and gives $1 to that
player. What is the probability that after the bell has rung 2019 times, each player will
have $1? (For example, Raashan and Ted may each decide to give $1 to Sylvia, and
Sylvia may decide to give her dollar to Ted, at which point Raashan will have $0, Sylvia
will have $2, and Ted will have $1, and that is the end of the first round of play. In the
second round Rashaan has no money to give, but Sylvia and Ted might choose each
other to give their $1 to, and the holdings will be the same at the end of the second
round.)

Example 12.5 (AIME)
An ant makes a sequence of moves on a cube where a move consists of walking from one
vertex to an adjacent vertex along an edge of the cube. Initially the ant is at a vertex of
the bottom face of the cube and chooses one of the three adjacent vertices to move to as
its first move. For all moves after the first move, the ant does not return to its previous
vertex, but chooses to move to one of the other two adjacent vertices. All choices are
selected at random so that each of the possible moves is equally likely. The probability
that after exactly 8 moves that ant is at a vertex of the top face on the cube ism
n, where
mandnare relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.
Solution
Note that the exact location of the ant is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is which
face the ant is on and where it came from.
After the first move, there are 4 different states we must consider. What
are they?
1. Top-to-Bottom: On the bottom face and just came from the top face
2. Top-to-Top: On the top face and just came from the top face
3. Bottom-to-Bottom: On the bottom face and just came from the bottom face
4. Top-to-Bottom: On the bottom face and just came from the top face
5. Bottom-to-Top: On the top face and just came from the bottom face
After the first move, what’s the probability we are in each of the above states
The ant walks in all 4 directions with equal probability. 3 of them are on the bottom
and 1 is on the top so there is a2
3chance of being in the state Bottom-to-Bottom and a1
3
chance of being in the state Bottom-to-Top.
What’s the probability the ant will be in the Top-to-Top state after nturns?
The ant must have originally been in either the Bottom-to-Top state or Top-to-Top state.
If the ant was originally in the Bottom-to-Top state, it can’t go back down so will go to the
Top-to-Top state with probability 1.
169
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 12. Probability States
If the ant was originally in the Top-to-Top state, it has 2 choices for where to move, one
of which is back down. So, it will go to the Top-to-Top state with probability1
2.
We write the equation
Top-to-Topn= Bottom-to-Topn−1+1
2×Top-to-Topn−1
What’s the probability the ant will be in the Bottom-to-Top state after nturns?
170
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 12. Probability States
The ant must have originally been in either the Top-to-Bottom state or Bottom-to-Bottom
state.
If the ant was originally in the Top-to-Bottom state, it can’t go back up the same path it
came down, so it’s impossible to reach the Bottom-to-Top state.
If the ant was originally in the Bottom-to-Bottom state, it has 2 choices for where to move,
one of which is up. So, it will go to the Bottom-to-Top state with probability1
2.
We write the equation
Bottom-to-Topn=1
2×Bottom-to-Bottom n−1
171
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 12. Probability States
Using similar logic, we get the equations
Bottom-to-Bottom n= Top-to-Bottomn−1+1
2×Bottom-to-Bottom n−1
Top-to-Bottomn=1
2×Top-to-Topn−1
Now, we simply make a table and iteratively compute the probability of being in each
state after n moves:

12.2 Expected Value States
Concept 12.2.1
Expected value state problems have nearly an identical process to those of probability
states. The only difference is that with every equation, we must add 1. For example, the
expected number of moves from position A= expected number of moves from position
B+ 1. We must add 1 because it takes 1 move to go from AtoB.
Example 12.6 (SMT)
Suppose two equally strong tennis players play against each other until one player wins
three games in a row. The results of each game are independent, and each player will
win with equal probability. What is the expected value of the number of games they
will play?
Solution
The key idea in this problem is the symmetry between the teams. We will use this to
drastically simplify our states equations.
How many possible states are there for the match?
There are 3 states: no team has won (only at the start), a team has won 1 in a row,
and a team has won 2 in a row. Note that whether it is team 1 or 2 that has won games in a
row they are symmetric.
What is the expected value equation based on this?
Letabe the expected number of games more when no team has won, bbe the expected
number of games when a team has won 1 game in a row, and cbe the expected number of
games when a team has won 2 games in a row.
Fora, regardless of which team wins, we are now in the state bso we have a=b+ 1.
Forb, if the same team that has won 1 in a row wins again, then we are in state c. If
the other team wins, we are again in state b(since now the other team has won 1 in a row).
Therefore, we have b= 1 +1
2×b+1
2×cwhich simplifies to b= 2 +c.
Forc, if the same team that has won 2 in a row wins again, then the expected num-
ber of additional games is 0. If the other team wins, we are in state b. Therefore, we have
c= 1 +1
2×0 +1
2×bwhich simplifies to 2 c= 2 +b.
173
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 12. Probability States
We solve the last 2 equations:
2c= 2 +b= 2 + (2 + c) = 4 +c=⇒c= 4 andb= 6
and from here we see our answer, a= 7 .

Remark 13.4.3
You can generally apply this factorization when you have xy,x, andyterms. After
applying the factorization, you can then find all possible values for each of your terms in
your factorization (remember negatives!).

Essentially, when flipping the coefficients of a polynomial, it will have roots that are
reciprocals of the original roots.

Remark 15.3.3
Remember, if the roots are k more, than we subtract k from each of the x terms in our
polynomial.

r−3,1

Note thatanegative number = 0 as that might show up in your expansion.
Essentially, what this is saying is
1.Start off with a Skvalue and multiply by it by the leftmost polynomial coefficient.
2. Then, multiply Sn−1by the polynomial’s coefficient right after it.
3. Continue doing so and summing the products until either
•k= 0 in which case instead of multiplying S0by last the last a term we
multiplyk
•an−ibecomes 0 in which case we simply add the last term and stop
4. Set your final sum of terms to be equal to 0

Definition 16.0.1 (Arithmetic Sequence) .An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers
with the same difference between consecutive terms.
1,4,7,10,13,..., 40
is an arithmetic sequence because there is always a difference of 3 between consecutive terms.
Remark 16.0.2
Note that an arithmetic sequence can also have a negative common difference. For
example, in the arithmetic sequence
40,37,34,..., 4,1
the common difference is −3.
Definition 16.0.3 (Arithmetic Sequence Notation) .In general, the terms of an arithmetic
sequence can be represented as:
a1,a2,a3,a4,...,an
where
•dis the common difference between consecutive terms
•nis the number of terms
Theorem 16.0.4 (nth term in an Arithmetic Sequence)

Definition 17.0.1 (Geometric Sequence) .A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers
with the same ratio between consecutive terms.
1,2,4,8,16,32...,1024
is a geometric sequence because there is always a ratio of 2 between consecutive terms.

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 22. Primes and Factors
Definition 22.0.1 (Primes) .Primes are numbers that have exactly two factors: 1 and the
number itself. Ex. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc. are all primes
Remark 22.0.2
In order to check whether a number nis prime, we need to check all the primes that are
less than or equal to√n
Concept 22.0.3 (Prime Factorization)
Prime factorization is a way to express each number as a product of primes.
Example: prime factorization of 60 is 22×3×5
Example 22.1 (AMC 10)
Kiana has two older twin brothers. The product of their three ages is 128. What is the
sum of their three ages?
Video Solution
Theorem 22.0.4 (Number of Factors of a Number)
If the prime factorization of the number is expressed as:
pe1
1×pe2
2×···×pek
k
then the number of factors of this number is
(e1+ 1)(e2+ 1)...(ek+ 1)
Remark 22.0.5
Basically, in order to find the number of factors of a number:
1. Find the prime factorization of the number
2. Add 1 to all of the exponents
272
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 22. Primes and Factors
3. Multiply them together

Concept 22.1.2 (Sum of Factors of a Number)
Essentially, for a prime p in the prime factorization, first find the sum of pkfor all
possible exponents k in the prime factorization. Then, we will multiply all such sums for
all of the primes to get the sum of all the factors of the number.

The product of GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two
numbers:
GCD (m,n)·LCM (m,n) =m·n
Theorem 24.0.5
If two numbers have a common factor c, then
gcd(ac,bc ) =c·gcd(a,b)
Example 24.1 (Omega Learn)

Theorem 24.0.6 (Euclidean Algorithm)
The Euclidean algorithm states that
gcd(x,y) =gcd(x−ky,y)
wherex>y andkis a positive integer.
Remark 24.0.7
We can apply the Euclidean Algorithm multiple times to easily find the GCD of large
numbers since after applying the Euclidean algorithm, we know have 2 smaller numbers
which we can apply the Euclidean Algorithm again until we get 2 very small numbers.
For example,
gcd(186,92) = gcd((186−(2·92)),92)
= gcd(2,92)
= gcd(2,(92−(2·46)))
= gcd(2,0)
= 2

Definition 27.0.1. A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation such that the only
solutions are integers (i.e. all variables have integer values).
Concept 27.0.2 (Strategies to Solve Diophantine Equations)
Here are some ideas on how to solve diophantine equations
•Take mods of different numbers. This is generally useful when you
1. Show there are no solutions to a Diophantine equation
2. Show that there are only a specific type of solution
•Bound the possible values of different terms, generally useful when there are a
finite number of solutions to your Diophantine equations
•Factoring, using the various factorizations (see the algebra section on this), can
help find all the solutions
•Make substitutions to simplify your Diophantine equation
•Look for conditions on what must be multiples/divisors of your variables and
rewrite your Diophantine equation in terms of that (ex. if you know ais multiple
of 6, then can make substitution a= 6k)

30.1 Basics of Angle Chasing
•Sum of angles in triangle is 180 °
•Sum of angles in a line is 180 °
•A triangle with 2 equal angles will have their corresponding sides equal and a triangle
with 2 sides equal will have their corresponding angles equal. Such a triangle is called
an isosceles triangle.
Concept 30.1.1 (Complementary Angle)
Complementary angles are a pair of angles with the sum of 90 degrees
Concept 30.1.2 (Supplementary Angle)
Supplementary angles are a pair of angles with the sum of 180 degrees
Concept 30.1.3 (Intersecting lines)
When two lines intersect, the vertical angles are equal. Vertical angles are each of the
pairs of opposite angles made by two intersecting lines. ”Vertical” in this case means
they share the same Vertex (corner point), not the usual meaning of up-down.

Theorem 30.1.7 (Inscribed Arc Theorem)
The angle formed by an arc in the center or the arc angle is double of the angle formed
on the edge.
359
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 30. Angle Chasing
Corollary 30.1.8 (Inscribed Right Triangle)
Inscribed triangle with diameter as one side is always a right triangle.
Definition 30.1.9 (Chord) .A Chord is a line segment between any two distinct points on
the circle. The diameter of the circle is the longest chord in the circle.
Theorem 30.1.10
The perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through the center. In the figure below,
the perpendicular bisectors of AB and CD intersect at the center O.
360
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 30. Angle Chasing
Corollary 30.1.11 •Congruent chords are equidistant from the center of a circle.
•If two chords in a circle are congruent, then their intercepted arcs are congruent.
•If two chords in a circle are congruent, then they determine two central angles that
are congruent.
Theorem 30.1.12
The angle marked in the diagram is half of the difference of the 2 red arcs.
∠APC =BD⌢−AC⌢

average of the two arcs.
∠BPC =∠APD =BC⌢+ AD⌢

Theorem 30.1.14
If a tangent R intersects the circle at Q, and a chord QP is drawn, then the ∠RQP is
equal to half the arc angle
Remark 30.1.15
Circles are really useful for angle chasing so keep an eye out for the inscribed arc theorem
362
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 30. Angle Chasing
that can be used in many angle chasing problems.
Remark 30.1.16
A useful trick to solving angle chasing problems with regular polygons is to draw a circle
around the polygon and use the inscribed arc theorem.
Theorem 30.1.17
Equal chords mark out equal arcs
This basically means that if you have 2 chords of the same length, the sector of the circle
they mark out will be equal
Definition 30.1.18 (Tangent) .A tangent is any line from a point external to the circle that
just touches the circle.
Theorem 30.1.19 (Right Angle Tangency Point)
If you connect the center of a circle to the point where the circle and a line are tangent,
they will form a right angle.
Remark 30.1.20
This property is very useful in circle problems as it allows us to work with right angles.
In addition, another helpful technique is drawing useful radii to various points in your
diagram as that opens up new information to work with.

Theorem 33.0.1
For similar triangles:
1. All the angles of the triangles are same
2. All corresponding sides have same ratio
3. Area ratio is the square of side length ratio
Concept 33.0.2 (Similarity Test)
Two triangles are similar if the three angles in the triangle are the same. In other words,
the triangles are the same shape multiplied by a scale factor. In general, triangles are
similar if:
•AA similarity: Two angles of the triangles are same, which basically means that
the third angle will be equal)
•SAS similarity (Side Angle Side): Two sides are proportional and the angle between
the sides is equal
•SSS similarity (Side Side Side): All three sides are proportional
•HL similarity (Hypotenuse Leg): In a right triangle, hypotenuse and leg are
proportional
•LL similarity (LL Leg): In a right triangle, the two legs are proportional
Warning: SSA does not mean triangles are similar
An easy way to detect similar triangles is if bases of triangles are parallel and the
sides of the triangles are collinear (see figure below)

35.4 Cyclic Quadrilaterals
Theorem 35.4.1 (Properties of a Cyclic quadrilateral)
Sum of opposite angles = 180
You can draw a circle around quadrilateral and use angle chasing properties for circles
like the inscribed angle theorem.
Concept 35.4.2
Sometimes, there may be quadrilaterals not explicitly stated to be in a circle. Then, if
the sum of opposite angles is 180 °or if the angles satisfy properties from the inscribed
angle theorem, then you can identify them to be a cyclic quadrilateral, and you can
use any of the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or even circles because you know the
quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle.

38.1 Area of Complex Shapes
Concept 38.1.1
Tricks to finding the area of complex shapes
•Divide the shape into “nicer” areas which are easier to calculate
•Extend Lines
–You generally want to extend lines when they form nicer shapes/areas to work
with, such as triangles
•Break up areas
–A common way to do so is to drop altitudes as doing so generally allows you
to form right triangles
Remark 38.1.2
A common technique is to find the area of shapes and then find the area of a shape in
terms of a variable (like altitude, inradius, circumradius, etc.) and then solve for that
variable.

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 38. Area and Length of Complex Shapes
•Be on the lookout for 90 degree angles, as you can use Pythagorean theorem
•Split the length into multiple components by using some of these techniques
–Drawing extra lines
–Dropping Altitudes
•Extending lines to create similar triangles, special triangles, etc. and then sub-
tracting the extra length

41.1 Trivial Inequality
Theorem 41.1.1 (Trivial Inequality)
For realx,x2≥0
This means all perfect squares are 0 or more.
Corollary 41.1.2 (Completing the Square)
In a quadratic Q(x) =ax2+bx+c,
•Ifa>0, then the minimum value of Q(x) isc−b2
4aand occurs when x=−b
2a
•Ifa<0, then the maximum value of Q(x) isc−b2
4aand occurs when x=−b
2a
Remark 41.1.3
Simple, yet powerful. This is the core of all inequalities and how more advanced
inequalities are derived.
The rest of the inequalities are optional for the AMC 10 but are still good to know.
41.2 AM-GM
Theorem 41.2.1 (AM-GM Inequality For 2 variables)
For non-negative reals a and b,
a+b
2≥√
ab
Basically, this means the average of 2 non-negative numbers (arithmetic mean) is always
at least as big as the square root of the product of the 2 numbers (the geometric mean).
Note that equality in this expression occurs when a=b.
Corollary 41.2.2
The minimum value of x+1
xis 2 and occurs when x= 1
•The minimum value of a+b(ifabremains constant) occurs when a=b
•The maximum value of ab(ifa+bremains constant) occurs when a=b

Example 41.1 (AMC 12)
LetA,M, andCbe non-negative integers such that A+M+C= 12. What is the
maximum value of A·M·C+A·M+M·C+A·C?
Video Solution
Theorem 41.2.3 (AM-GM Inequality For More Variables)
For non-negative reals a1,a2,...an,
a1+a2+···+an
n≥n√a1·a2·a3····an
Note that equality occurs when a1=a2···=an. (essentially all the variables are equal).
Another way to say this is
Average of n numbers ≥n/radicalig
product of all n numbers
Remark 41.2.4
This means in general,
min(a1+a2+a3+···+an) =n·n√a1·a2·a3····an
max(a1·a2·a3····an) =/parenleftbigga1+a2+···+an
n/parenrightbiggn
Essentially,
min(sum of all numbers) = n·n/radicalig
product of all numbers)
max(product of all numbers) = (average of all numbers)n
Remark 41.2.5
Generally, we use AM-GM to maximize products or minimize sums.

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 41. Inequalities
Theorem 41.2.6 (Weighted AM-GM Inequality)
For non-negative reals, ai,ci,
c1·a1+c2·a2+···+cn·an
c1+c2+···+cn≥c1+c2+···+cn/radicalig
ac1
1·ac2
2·ac3
3·····acnn
Remark 41.2.7
Weighted AM-GM is very similar to AM-GM. One way to visualize weighted AM-GM
is that there are cknumber of terms which are all equal to ak. So instead of writing
ak+ak+···+akcktimes in our sum we simply write ak·ck, and instead of writing
ak·ak·... cktimes in our product we simply write ack
k.
Remark 41.2.8
We use weighted AM-GM when we are trying to make the sum of all terms a constant
by multiplying weights to all (or some) the terms. Remember to divide by the weights
you multiplied at the end.
Example 41.2
Find the maximum value of x3(4−x).

41.3 Cauchy Schwarz
Theorem 41.3.1 (Cauchy Schwarz)
For realsaiandbi,
(a1·b1+a2·b2+···+an·bn)2≤(a2
1+a2
2+...a2
n)(b2
1+b2
2+...b2
n)
This means
(the sum of the products of all akandbk)2≤
product of the sum of squares of all akandbk
Equality holds when the ratio ofai
bi
for all i is the same.
Remark 41.3.2
If you ever forget which side the ≥sign faces, just try a small example like a1= 1,
a2= 2,b1= 3, andb2= 4.
Remark 41.3.3
You generally want to apply Cauchy Schwarz when you are dealing with sums of squares.
Corollary 41.3.4 (Titu’s Lemma)
For realsaiandbi,
a2

b1+a2
2
b2+···+a2

bn≥(a1+a2+···+an)2

Alternately,
a1
b1+a2
b2+···+an
bn≥(√a1+√a2+···+√an)2
b1+b2+b3+···+bn
Note that this is a direct consequence of Cauchy Schwartz.

42.1 Basic Definitions
Definition 42.1.1 (Logarithm) .A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised
in order to get some other number.
Logarithms are expressed as
a=logbn
wherebis the base and nis the number.
Basically, we are trying to calculate how many times we need to multiply the base to get the
number a, or what power do we need to raise the base to get the number a.
Theorem 42.1.2 (Converting to Logarithm and Exponents)
logxy=a=⇒xa=y
.

42.2 Logarithmic Formulas
Theorem 42.2.1 (Important Formulas)
logaar=r
logabc= logab+ logac
logab
c= logab−logac
logabc=clogab
logab·logbc=logb
loga·logc
logb=logc
loga= logac
logba=1
logab
logba=logda
logdb
Remark 42.2.2
This last formula is known as the ”Base Change Formula” and is the most useful of them
all. Often times in logarithm problems you can just expand out your expression in terms
of this formula and simplify the expression to get the answer.
Remark 42.2.3
These formulas are extremely important for working with logarithms and should definitely
be memorized.
Remark 42.2.4
If you ever forget which way the sign of these logarithms are, you can just try a small
example like log10100 +log101000 =log10100,000 so from here for example you could
figure out the sum of logarithms identity.

OmegaLearn.org Chapter 42. Logarithms
Remark 42.2.5

Remark 42.2.7
These formulas are less important and aren’t necessary for most logarithm problems,
but still good to know.
Concept 42.2.8
When you take a logarithm of numbers which form a geometric progression, the logarithms
of those numbers form an arithmetic progression.

45.1 Basics
Definition 45.1.1. A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a+bi,
whereaandbare real numbers, and irepresents the “imaginary unit” . ais the real part of
our number, and biis the imaginary part. Complex numbers are often represented by the
variablez.
Definition 45.1.2. i=√−1,i2=−1,i3=−i,i4= 1
Remark 45.1.3
Powers oficycle every 4 terms, so i4n=i4= 1,i4n+1=i=√−1,i4n+2=i2=
−1,i4n+3=i3=−i
Theorem 45.1.4 (Adding Complex Numbers)
(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i
Theorem 45.1.5 (Subtracting Complex Numbers)
(a+bi)−(c+di) = (a−c) + (b−d)i
Theorem 45.1.6 (Multiplying Complex Numbers)
(a+bi)·(c+di) = (ac−bd) + (bc+ad)i
Definition 45.1.7 (Real and Imaginary Parts) .The imaginary part of a complex number
a+biis b and the real part is a.
Remark 45.1.8
The imaginary part does not include a factor of i.
Definition 45.1.9. A complex conjugate is found by flipping the sign of the imaginary part
of complex number, and is represented as ¯ z.
659
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 45. Complex Numbers
Theorem 45.1.10 (Finding Conjugates)
z=a+bi=a−bi
Definition 45.1.11 (Complex Plane) .A complex number can also be represented geometri-
cally by expressing a+bias (a,b) on the Complex plane. The x-axis represents the Real axis
and the y-axis represents the Imaginary axis.
Definition 45.1.12. The magnitude of a complex number is represented by |z|, and is the
distance of a complex number ( a,b) from the origin.
Theorem 45.1.13 (Magnitude of a Complex Number)
|z|=|a+bi|=√
a2+b2
Theorem 45.1.14 (Multiplying Complex Numbers with their Conjugates)
(a+bi)(a−bi) =a2+b2
Theorem 45.1.15
For a complex number z,z×z=|z|2
Remark 45.1.16
This is derived from the theorem above. It is super useful!
Example 45.1 (AIME)

45.1.1 Polar Form
Definition 45.1.17. The angle that the positive real axis makes with the ray that connects
the origin with a complex number is called the argument of that complex number and is
represented by θ.
Theorem 45.1.18 (Argument of a Complex Number)
The argument θof a complex number a+biis

Definition 45.1.21. Polar form is another way to represent a complex number based on its
modulusrand argument θ.
Theorem 45.1.22 (Polar Form)
z=a+bi=r(cosθ+isinθ) =rcisθ
Remark 45.1.23
cisθis just short for cos θ+isinθ
Remark 45.1.24
Trigonometric ratios tell us that cosθ=a
randsinθ=b
r, which we can rearrange to see
thatrcosθ=aandrsinθ=b. Plugging in these values gives us the polar form formula.
Remark 45.1.25
cosθ+isinθcan also be written as cis θ.
Theorem 45.1.26 (Euler’s Formula)
Euler’s Formula tells us that
cosθ+isinθ=eiθ
, which tells us that
z=a+bi=r(cosθ+isinθ) =reiθ
.
Remark 45.1.27
Euler’s Identity is a special case of Euler’s Formula and tells us that

Theorem 45.1.30 (Rotating a Point)
To rotate a point θradians counterclockwise, covert a coordinate to its corresponding
complex number and multiply it by eiθ. Converting this back to ordered pairs gives us
our answer.
Theorem 45.1.31 (De Moivre’s Theorem)
For a complex number z=reiθand a real number n,
zn= (reiθ)n=rn[cos(nθ) +isin(nθ)]

Remark 45.1.32
We can use this to evaluate expressions like
(√

Concept 45.1.34
Complex numbers and their relations to circles makes them easy to work with for many
geometry problems, especially when dealing with polygons such as equilateral triangles
or squares.
How to solve geometry problems using complex numbers:
1. Assign a complex number to 1 or more of the coordinates
2. To find the complex numbers for other points, multiple/divide by eiθ
664

3. Use the information you have to solve for what you are asked in the problem
Remark 45.1.35
We can also view algebraic complex number problems geometrically.

Additional Techniques and Strategies
46.1 Meta-solving Techniques
Video Lectures
Meta-solving Techniques
Definition 46.1.1. Meta-solving is finding the answer to a problem without actually solving
it.
Remark 46.1.2
These techniques may not work for all problems. These techniques are especially useful
when the problem provides answer choices.
Remark 46.1.3 (Meta-Solving Warning)
Don’t get too carried away with these techniques to the point where you don’t even try
to solve the problem legitimately.
Concept 46.1.4 (Engineering Induction)
Engineering Induction is the process of trying and finding the value to small cases and
assuming it’s true for larger ones.
Steps for Engineering Induction Problems:
1. Try small cases
2. Look for a pattern amongst those small cases (there may not always be one)
678
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
3. Assume the pattern can continue for larger cases and find the answer
Remark 46.1.5
We can try to apply engineering induction when we see the values in the problem seem
hard/impossible to compute.
679
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
Concept 46.1.6 (Looking for unique properties of numbers)
Rather than computing the exact answer, we can compute unique properties of your
answer choices so that you can eliminate all answer choices that don’t satisfy the property
and so that you will be left with 1 answer choice (or possibly more in which case you
can just guess from the remaining ones)
Some unique properties you can look for in your answer choices and try to compute are
•Units Digit
•Last 2 digits
•Parity (Even, Odd)
•Perfect square or not one
•Prime/composite
•Modulus (remainders when divided by 3, 4, 5, etc.)
•Denominators of common fractions (or what they must divide)
•Multiples/Factors of numbers
•etc.
Remark 46.1.7
These last 2 properties are especially useful in combinatorics problems as you can easily
find numbers you have to multiply with each other to get your answer.
Concept 46.1.8
Look for the option choices that are the ”odd one out” or that are different from all
others
•Look for outliers (primes, large/small numbers, odd/even numbers, powers of 2,
etc)
Concept 46.1.9 (Trying all the Option choices)
In some problems, you can
•Try all the option choices into the conditions in the problem
•Look at the conditions in the problem and see which of the option choices could
work
680
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
•etc.
After doing so, you will either have a better guess or exact answer.
Concept 46.1.10 (Elimination of Option Choices)
Tying closely to the previous technique, you can also usually eliminate option choices
based on
•Unique properties of Numbers (See Above)
•How large or small the number must be
Remark 46.1.11
We would recommend guessing ONLY if you can narrow it to 2 or 3 option choices.
Concept 46.1.12 (Estimation of Answer)
Often times in problems (especially geometry) you can easily find an approximate answer
and see which of the option choices most closely matches what you got.
In geometry, a common strategy to do so is to mark out areas approximately equal to
those of areas you know.
Concept 46.1.13 (Using Freedom in Problems)
Assuming facts when you have freedom in the problem statement can be very useful.
Essentially, as long as the problem is not telling you ”this fact is not true” (so, whatever
assumption you want to make will satisfy the problem’s conditions) you can assume the
fact is true to simplify your problem and make it really easy to solve.
For example, if you are asked to find some universal ratio in a triangle and you aren’t
specifically told that the triangle isn’t equilateral, you can just assume the triangle is
equilateral and solve the remaining problem from there.
Remark 46.1.14
Make sure not to assume false information! Be very careful that your assumption can be
true.
In our previous example, if we were told the triangle had 2 sides of length 7 and
8, then our assumption would be false, so it wouldn’t work then.

46.2 Silly Mistakes
Silly mistakes are very common and can really lower your score on the AMC 10/12. Here are
some tips on how to avoid the different kinds of silly mistakes:
Concept 46.2.1 (Avoiding Arithmetic Errors)
A good way to avoid arithmetic errors is to
•Do your computation 2 ways (e.g. If you have to do 87 ·93, you can multiply them
with 87 on the top and with 93 on top)
•Be more organized, and write more steps
Concept 46.2.2 (Avoiding Mathematical Errors)
An easy way to avoid mathematical errors is to
•Do your work neatly!
•Make boxes for each problem on scratch paper per problem
•Don’t skip steps
•Check your work, following the tip above will make it easier to do so
•Do your steps methodically
•Try to substitute your answer back into the problem (if you can)
•Try an alternate solution to confirm your answer
•Estimate what the answer has to be, and see if your answer is close to what your
estimate is
Concept 46.2.3 (Avoid Reading Errors)
Reading the problem wrong is one of the most common mistakes. Often times, you might
forget about important key words like
•inclusive, except
•even, odd
•prime, composite
•integer, natural, real, complex
682
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
Some strategies to avoid them are
•After solving the problem, reread the question part of the problem to make sure
you are answering what the question asks for!
•Underline key words while reading (that’s probably gonna be hard this year with
the test being online, but as an alternative you can take note of the important
words on your scratch paper)
Concept 46.2.4 (Avoid Missing a Final Step Errors)
Sometimes in problems, you might be so caught up in moving forward in the test that
you might forget an important step at the end.
For example, in a problem you might think ”I’ll multiply by 5 to whatever answer
I get” and then you find that answer but forget to multiply by 5. A way to avoid this is:
•Write ”Remember ... ” big and bold on your scratch or the question paper
Remark 46.2.5
A very common reading mistake is getting confused between the words non-negative and
positive. Remember, non-negative includes 0 while positive doesn’t!
Concept 46.2.6 (Avoid Making False Assumptions)
Often times, you might just think something is true and assume it’s true for the rest
of the problem, when really it was false. Proving all your assumptions can be too time
consuming. However we recommend at least seeing some sort of reasoning for why your
assumption should be correct (unless of course you are using one of the meta-solving
techniques).
Concept 46.2.7 (Avoid Casework Errors)
Many times, in casework problems you might
•Undercount possibilities
•Overcount possibilities
•Miss edges/extreme cases
Some strategies to avoid them are
•Be methodical in your casework
683
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
•Make sure all your cases work
–An easy way to do this is just to try a few examples in your case to see if they
actually work
–Especially, make sure to check if extremes work
–Make sure all your cases are disjoint and that you are not overcounting
anything that’s common between the cases
–Make sure your cases cover all possibilities that the problem asks for
–Solve the problem in multiple ways (for example, by both casework and
complementary counting)
Remark 46.2.8
I know that some of these strategies may take a lot of extra time to follow so we
recommend analyzing how you are making silly mistakes and from there see which
strategies you will want to follow.
684
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
46.3 Other Strategies To Maximize Your Score
Concept 46.3.1 (Plan Your Time)
Make sure to plan your time.
•Questions 1-10 are generally easy, 11-20 are medium, 21-25 are hard
•Sometimes one of the early questions can be hard or bashy, or a later question can
be easy
•Don’t get stuck on a question. Move on and come back to it later.
•Star any question you are unsure about but you feel you can solve it, or any
questions that you solved but are not confident of your answer
•Budget your time properly
•Leave enough time for last 10 problems
•Leave some time to review starred problems and check your work
Concept 46.3.2 (Guessing Strategies)
If you want to guess, make sure to keep these things in mind:
•You get 1.5 points for leaving a question blank, so if you don’t know how to solve
the problem, just leave it blank
•Try using meta-solving strategies above
•If you can narrow down the choices to 2-3 options, only then make an educated
guess
Concept 46.3.3 (Test Day Strategies)
Here are some test day strategies:
•Don’t try to cram or study on the day before the test
–Just review a few formulas or strategies from this book
•Be relaxed
–Get a good night’s sleep
–Eat a healthy meal
685
OmegaLearn.org Chapter 46. Additional Techniques and Strategies
–Meditate
–Eat dark chocolate
–Listen to music
–Or whatever else makes you feel relaxed
Concept 46.3.4 (Problem Solving Strategies)
Try to remember these problem solving strategies:
•When you are stuck, try to use the information in the problem you haven’t used
yet
•When solving a problem, think of what technique would likely be at play
•Don’t get too stuck with one approach to a problem, move on, and come back to
the problem with a fresh perspective
•In problems that seem complex, try small cases to look for a pattern that can allow
you to figure out how to approach the problem and what patterns may exist (this
is similar to engineering induction)
Concept 46.3.5 (AIME Qualification)
To qualify for AIME, based on recent cutoff scores, you will need a score of at least
105. However you should aim for 110+ to be safe. For this, you’ll need a 17-0-8 split
(right-wrong-skipped), a 18-5-2 split, a 19-6-0 split or something better.
Concept 46.3.6 (USAJMO/USAMO Qualification)
To qualify for USAJMO/USAMO, you’ll probably need a score of at least 120 to have a
good chance (of course this also depends heavily on your AIME score).
Remark 46.3.7
Another strategy for the AMC 10/12B is that if you are expecting a AIME qualifying
score on the AMC 10/12A, then you should try to solve more problems and take a
”higher risk higher reward” approach for the AMC 10/12B, however if you didn’t do
good on the A, you should take a safe path.
Remark 46.3.8
Last, but most important, don’t stress out too much about how you will do! It’s just a
math contest, and you’ll probably have many more opportunities in the future.
Good luck to you on your math competitions. We hope you found this book useful!
