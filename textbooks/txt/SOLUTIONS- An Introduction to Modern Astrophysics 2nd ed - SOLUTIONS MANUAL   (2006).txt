From Fig. S1.1, the time required for a superior planet to go from opposition (point P1) to quadrature ( P2) can
be combined with its sidereal period (from Eq. 1.1) to ﬁnd the angle ∠P1SP2. In the same time interval Earth

(c) A geosynchronous satellite must be “parked” over the equator and orbiting in the direction of Earth’s

2.11 Since planetary orbits are very nearly circular (except Mercury and Pluto), the assumption of perfectly circular
motion was a good approximation. Furthermore, since a geocentric model maintains circular motion, it wasvery dif ﬁcult to make any observational distinction between geocentric and heliocentric universes. (Parallax
effects are far too small to be noticeable with the naked eye.)

According to the starship pilot, while outbound the starship r eceives a signal when

At that point, the starship immediately reverses direction and travels back toward Earth. Again according to
Eq. (4.31) with /SOHtrestD6months and /DC2D180ı, during the return trip the time interval between receiving

second-order spectra of these two lines is therefore /SOH/DC2D0:0219 ˚A.
(b) From Eq. (5.2), the number of lines that must be illuminated is

This means that the quantity “ e2” should be repl aced by “ Ze2” wherever it appears in an expression for

(b) In this binary system, the larger star is hotter. At the primary minimum (phase = 0.0), the maximum
amount of the larger star is covered, implying the least total integrated ﬂux (or luminosity). The primary
minimum is not ﬂat because the proximity of the sec ondary star leads to tidal distortion of the shapes of
the stars, thus removing spherical symmetry. The brightness of the system increases until, at phase 0.25,the two stars are seen in pro ﬁle. As the secondary passes behind the primary, the brightness decreases,
reaching a ﬂat minimum at phase 0.5. The secondary minimum is ﬂat because the sec ondary (and the
distortion effects) are occulted for a ﬁnite period of time.
7.9 See Fig. S7.1.

7.10 Massive planets with short orbital periods exert a greater force on the parent star, thus producing higher radial
velocities of the stars themselves. In addition, shorter periods imply that a greater number of orbital periodscan be measured over a given length of time.
7.11 From Eq. (7.7), it is evident that only msinican be determined, unless the angle of inclination can be
determined independently (meaning that the system must be eclipsing).

(b) From Kepler’s third law (Eq. 2.37), with PD1:8yr,M1D0:5MˇandM2D2:0Mˇ,aD2:0AU.
Also, since m1=m2Da2=a1(Eq. 7.1) and aDa1Ca2D2:0AU, we have a1D1:6AU and
a2D0:4AU. Now, the orbital velocities of the two stars are v1D2/EMa1=PD26:5km s/NUL1and
v2D2/EMa2=PD6:6km s/NUL1. Finally, taking into consideration the orbital inclination of 30ı,t h e
maximum observable radial velocities are v1r;maxDv1siniD13:2km s/NUL1andv2r;maxDv2siniD
3:351km s/NUL1.
(c) The eccentricity can be determined by considering the asymmetries in the velocity and/or light curves.
In particular, the velocity curves deviate from being perfectly sinusoidal (the amount of deviation in-creasing with increasing e). Also, for an eclipsing system, the primary and secondary minima are not

The Classiﬁcation of Stellar Spectra
8.1 In the following, it is easiest to express Boltzmann’s constant as kD8:6174 /STX10/NUL5eV K/NUL1. At a room

IfkTD1eV, then TD1:16/STX104K. IfkTD13:6eV, then TD1:58/STX105K.
8.2 A straightforward conversion of units shows that
kD8:6173423 /STX10/NUL5eV K/NUL1:
8.3 The peak of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, Fig. 8.6, shows that nv=n'6:5/STX10/NUL5sm/NUL1where
vDvmp. For a range of speeds /SOHvD2km s/NUL1, the fraction of hydrogen atoms within 1 km s/NUL1of the most
probable speed is .nv=n//SOHv'0:13.
8.4 The most probable speed, vmp, occurs at the peak of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, Eq. (8.1). Setting

Then, with N2=N1D0:01,TD1:97/STX104K. If the number of atoms in the ﬁrst excited state is only 10%
of the number of atoms in the ground state, then TD3:21/STX104K.
8.6 (a) We solve the Boltzmann equation, Eq. (8.6), for T:

Using the values in Problem 8.5 together with g3D2.3/3D18andE3D/NUL1:51eV, we ﬁnd that if

perturb the hydrogen orbital energies and increase the amount of ionization (pressure ionization). As a result,
practically all of the Sun’s hydrogen is ionized at the Sun’s center .
8.13 From the statement of the problem and Example 8.1.5, we have ZIID2:30,ZIIID1,PeD1:5Nm/NUL2,
/USIID11:9eV, and TD5777 K. Inserting these values into the alternative form of the Saha equation,
Eq. (8.9), we ﬁnd that ŒNIII=NII/c141CaD2:08/STX10/NUL3. Comparing this with ŒNII=NI/c141CaD918from Example 8.1.5

Stars of the same spectral type have the atoms in their atmospheres in the same states of ionization and

n
eincreases. Because a giant star has a lower atmospheric density than a main-sequence star of the same
spectral type, it must have a lower surface temperature to produce the same state of ionization of the atoms in
its atmosphere.

Assuming a pure hydrogen composition for simplicity, and if the entire star participates in the energy gener-
ation, the amount of energy released in the conversion of hydrogen to helium in a 0:072Mˇstar is
E0:072D./SOHm/c2D0:007.0:072Mˇ/c2D9:0/STX1043J:

Using the data from Problem 10.21, R0:072D5:9/STX107mD0:082RˇandR85D9:1/STX109mD13:1Rˇ.
Thus R0:072=R85D0:0063 .
10.23 The Eddington luminosity is given by Eq. (10.114).
(a) For MD0:072Mˇ,LEdD3:6/STX1031WD9:4/STX104Lˇ, implying that L=LEdD5/STX10/NUL10.
Radiation pressure does not play a signi ﬁcant role in the stability of a low-mass star.
(b) For MD120Mˇ, we may consider electron scattering as an appropriate opacity (the surface is ionized
at that temperature). In this case /DC4D0:02.1CX/D0:034,a n d LEdD4:6/STX106Lˇ. The actual
luminosity of the 120Mˇstar is about 1:8/STX106Lˇ, and so the Eddington luminosity is only about 2.5
times greater than the actual luminosity. Clearly radiation pressure plays a signi ﬁcant role in this case.
10.24 (a) The Lane–Emden equation is a second-order differential equation. One very powerful tool in numerical
analysis is to write second-order equations as two ﬁrst-order equations, one of which is the derivative of
the function that you are trying to solve. Beginning with Eq. (10.110) and taking the derivatives leads to

10.26 The (near) central conditions for the 0:75Mˇand1:0Mˇmodels are given in Table S10.2. For the simple
Runge–Kutta shooting method that is used in StatStar , the extrapolated central conditions are very sen-
sitive to the surface boundary conditions. Using the values of the last zone above the central core are moresmoothly-varying and reliable for comparisons between models.
In order to support the extra mass of the 1:0M
ˇmodel, the central pressure and temperature are increased
over the values for the 0:75Mˇmodel. Because the central pressure increases rapidly with stellar mass, the
central density is also greater for the 1Mˇstar. Since the central nuclear energy generation rate is a function
of both the temperature and density in that region, /SIis greater for the 1Mˇstar as well.
10.27 The input data for the zero-age main-sequence models are given in Table S10.3. Note that a region of conver-
gence exists in the effective temperature–luminosity plane. The models given here are only representative ofthe possible solutions at each mass. It is also important to note that Statstar was written to be relatively
transparent to the student for pedagogical reasons. Consequently, special automated, iterative convergence
techniques have not been included in the code. Furthermore, since it is necessary to have fairly tight conver-
gence criteria at the center of the star in order to produce a physically reasonable main sequence, and since thenumerical procedure amounts to a shooting method from the surface to the center, the code is quite sensitiveto initial starting conditions. This may lead to some initial frustration for some students attempting to ﬁnd a
converged model.
(a) See Figure S10.3. Note that the coarseness of the core is evident in L
randT. This arises because
the core solution is simply extrapolated from the last good zone computed by the Runge–Kutta method.A more sophisticated iterative procedure guarant eeing that the central boundary conditions are strictly

higher- Zmain sequence with the one for ZD0:008, calculated in Problem 10.27. Notice that the higher- Z
main sequence is shifted to cooler temperatures and lower luminosities. This is consistent with the discussionof Example 9.5.4 regarding the fact that the low- Zsubdwarfs are shifted to the left of the main sequence.

plotted are actually the last zone above the central core. This was done b ecause the core extrapolation procedure is
rather coarse.
(b) The ZD0:010model has the largest value for the opacity at the center, and throughout the star.
This is due primarily to the bound–free opacity equation (Eq. 9.22), which is proportional to Z(more
electronic transitions are available). A larger opacity results in a slightly in ﬂated star, having a lower
density and temperature near the surface. As a consequence, the temperature gradient (Eq. 10.68) is
shallower there. Integrating inward, the lower density and temperature means that the energy generationrate is diminished (e.g., Eq. 10.47), resulting in a lower luminosity for the star (Eq. 10.36).
(c) The ZD0:008model has the largest energy generation rate because of the larger values for the tem-
perature and density.

(c) The Sun’s lifetime on the main sequence is about 1010yr. Thus, the combined mass-loss rates of nuclear

not a signi ﬁcant fraction of the Sun’s total mass.

revealed by subtle wavelength shifts in molecular spectra.
12.8 (a) Oxygen is much less abundant than hydrogen, and therefore, any photons emitted by a downward tran-
sition of an oxygen atom are much more likely to escape the cloud, rather than being reabsorbed. The
photons then carry away cloud energy, resulting in cooling of the cloud. Oxygen atoms are also likely
to emit infrared photons, while hydrogen will likely emit visible and ultraviolet photons.
(b) Hot cores are quite optically thick ( AV/CAN50to 1000) and have high number densities. It is very dif ﬁcult
for photons to escape from the interiors of hot cores. Hot cores are also the site of mass star formation,
resulting in UV and X-ray photons, along with shocks that can heat the core.
12.9 As the density of a cloud increases, the likelihood of excitation collisions increases. As long as the cloud is
not too optically thick, the resulting deexcitations liberate photons from the cloud, resulting in cooling.

(b) The Hertzsprung gap occurs between points 3 and 5. The total elapsed time is 0.4627 Myr, which is
only 0.49% of the time spent on the main sequence between points 1 and 2.
(c) The blueward portion of the horizontal branch occurs between points 7 and 8, which amounts to 1.62%
of the main-sequence lifetime.
(d) The redward portion of the horizontal branch occurs between points 8 and 9, amounting to 6.8% of the
main-sequence lifetime.
13.2 The Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale is given by tKHD/c129Eg=L,w h e r e Lis the luminosity of the star and

From Table S13.1, the time spent between points 4 and 5 in Fig. 13.1 is roughly 350,000 yr. This is about 25

13.6 (a) An increase in luminosity, L, leads to increased radiation pressure, enhancing mass loss. A decrease in
the surface gravity, g, means that the surface material is less tightly bound, also enhancing mass loss.
As the radius, R, of the star increases for given values of Landg, the surface ﬂux decreases, decreasing
the effect of radiation pressure.

13.9 Color-magnitude diagrams of young galactic clusters, such as h and /USPersei (Fig. 13.18), reveal an incom-
plete main sequence. The stars on the lower end of the main sequence are missing while cool stars of greater
luminosity are lying above the main sequence instead. The presence of these stars is not explained by the
old theory. Furthermore, color-magnitude diagrams of old globular clusters, such as M3 (Fig. 13.17) showthat the upper main sequence is missing, repl aced by the distinct presence of a red giant branch c onnecting
the lower portion of the main sequence to the red giant stars. A horizontal branch is also present that doesnot lead to upper-main-sequence stars. These observations for old clusters would suggest that red giant stars
cannot be producing upper-main-sequence stars.
13.10 (a) The contraction time to the main sequence for a 0:8M
ˇstar is about 68 Myr while the main-sequence
lifetime of a 15Mˇstar (between points 1 and 2 on Fig. 13.1) is about 11 Myr. It takes signi ﬁcantly
longer for the 0:8Mˇstar to reach the main sequence than it does for the 15Mˇstar to evolve off the
main sequence. This is consistent with the presence of red giants and massive stars leaving the mainsequence before low-mass stars have arrived onto the main sequence in Fig. 13.18.
(b) According to Table 13.1, 68 Myr would be the main sequence lifetime of roughly a 6M
ˇstar.
13.11 (a) From Table 13.1, the main-sequence lifetime of a 0:8Mˇstar is about 18.8 Gyr, which is much longer
than the present age of the universe. This implies that 0:8Mˇstars haven’t had time to evolve off the
main sequence yet. The Sun’s main-sequence lifetime is about 10 Gyr, which is less than the age of theuniverse. For stars much below 1M
ˇ, the universe isn’t old enough yet for those stars to have evolved
off the main sequence, and so there is no observational data to compare with theoretical models.
(b) No, simply because there hasn’t been e nough time elapsed for those stars to leave the main sequence,
even if the globular cluster formed very near the beginning of the universe.

MB/NULMB;ˇD/NUL2:5log10.LB=LB;ˇ/
MV/NULMV;ˇD/NUL2:5log10.LV=LV;ˇ/:

B/NULVD2:5log10.LV=LB//NUL2:5log10.LV;ˇ=LB;ˇ/C.Bˇ/NULVˇ/:
(b) When placed on the same color-magnitude diagram, the red giant branch of M15 is shifted noticably to
the left (blueward) relative to 47 Tuc.
(c) Since M15 is less metal-rich than 47 Tuc, fewer electrons are available in the atmospheres of its stars
relative to the stars in 47 Tuc. This means that more atoms are in higher states of ionization becausefewer electrons are available for recombination (recall the Saha equation). As a consequence, the opacityis reduced in the atmospheres of M15 stars relative to 47 Tuc stars, and we can see down into deeper,hotter layers of stars in M15 relative to stars in 47 Tuc.
13.13 From Fig. 13.17, the turn-off point occurs at about B/NULVD0:4, corresponding to a value of VD19:2.
According to the composite main sequence of Fig. 13.19, B/NULVD0:4corresponds to M
VD3:6. Assuming
no interstellar extinction between Earth and M3 ( a/NAKD0), Eq. (12.1),

15.1 Using a mass estimate for /DC1Carinae of roughly 120 Mˇ, the Eddington luminosity (Eq. 10.6) is LEd'

The lower value for Sirius B is an indication that it is smaller than might be anticipated from the mass-

17.2 Suppose the photon in Fig. 17.11 travels at an angle /DC2measured from the vertical. Note that the frequency
meter must be shifted along the lab’s ceiling to the endpoint of the photon’s path. According to the observeron the ground, if the photon travels a distance dfrom the ﬂoor to the ceiling of the lab, then the lab has
fallen a vertical distance hDdcos/DC2in a time tDd=c. The downward speed of the frequency meter is thus

Close Binary Star Systems
18.1 Because equipotential surfaces are level surfaces for binary stars, we expect the density to be constant along
a surface of constant ˚. The behavior of the pressure may be deduced from the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium (Eq. 10.6) combined with Eq. (18.8) for the gravitational potential,
dP
drD/NUL/SUBgD/SUBd˚
dr:
For constant density, the pressure and gravitational potential vary spatially in the same way, so the pressure
should be approximately constant along an equipotential surf ace. Now consider the ideal gas law (Eq. 10.11),
PgD/SUBkT
/SYNmH;
making the reasonable assumption that the mean molecular weight, /SYN, is constant. This shows that if the
pressure and density are roughly constant along an equipotential surf ace, then the temperature will also be
approximately constant. The proximity of the other star could cause heating of each star on the side that facesthe other.

Typically, a classical nova’s outburst lasts about 100 days, so only a very small fraction of the hydrogen

(d) Except for Her X-1, the points in Fig. S18.2 lie along the line for the neutron-star model of a binary
X-ray pulsar. According to Rappaport and Joss (1977), for Her X-1 “the value of PP=Pﬂuctuates and
its sign even reverses. These sporadic intervals of spin-down, together with the small average value ofjPP=Pj, are indicative of a near balance between spinup and spindown for this source. Hence, external
torques are probably important for this system.”

radial-velocity curves of SS 433.
18.26 SS 433 is rD5:5kpc from Earth, and the X-ray emitting regions extend as much as /DC2D440D0:0128 rad
from SS 433. This corresponds to a separation of sDr/DC2D2:17/STX1018m. With a jet velocity of vD0:26c,
it would take the jets tDs=vD2:79/STX1010sD883yr to travel to the edge of the X-ray emitting regions.
The jets must have slowed as they penetrated the gases of the supernova remnant W50, so this may be taken
as a lower limit for the amount of time the jets have been active.

a total eclipse would not be possible.

19.18 According to Eq. (9.12), `D1=n/ESC. Assuming that the separation between atoms in a diatomic molecule is

19.21 (a) The initial eastward velocity of a projectile launched straight south from the North Pole is zero. Thus it
gets “left behind” as observers at lower latitudes move with the planet’s rotation. This makes the motionof the projectile appear to drift to the right as viewed from the launch point (i.e., westward drift).
(b) As a particle “falls” into a low pressure region, it’s motion de ﬂects to the right if it is moving either
northward or southward. This sets up a counterclockwise rotation about the center of the low pressure
region in the Northern Hemisphere (a consequence of the Coriolis effect).

aﬂuid, conducting (presumably molten iron-nickel) core of signi ﬁcant size. If such a core existed it
would imply a much higher core density relative to the mantle. This would then imply a smaller valuefor the moment-of-inertia ratio than is observed.

24.25 (a) We need to put together all of the pieces to the structure of the Galaxy from Table 24.1, as well as include
the contribution of dark matter to the total mass of the Galaxy. To include the later, we can integrate the

The mass of the visible components of the Galaxy interior to 25 kpc is (from Table 24.1) is 7:9/STX1010Mˇ
(the stellar halo was neglected for r<25kpc but represents only a small component to the total mass).
TheB-band luminosity for those components totals LBD2:1/STX1010Lˇ. Thus, the mass-to-light ratio
interior to r0D25kpc is approximately M=LBD21:4Mˇ=Lˇ
(b) For r0D100 kpc,MNFW D2:7/STX1012Mˇ. This implies that the total mass interior to 100kpc
(including the stellar halo) is approximately 2:78/STX1012Mˇ.T h e B-band luminosity is (again including
the stellar halo) LBD2:2/STX1010Mˇ, implying a mass-to-light ratio of 126Mˇ=Lˇ.
The presence of dark matter increases the mass-to-light ratio signi ﬁcantly throughout the universe.

CHAPTER 26
Galactic Evolution
26.1 (a) From Appendix G, the mass and radius of a main-sequence M0 star are MD0:51MˇandRD
0:63Rˇ, respectively. If the mass density of stars near the Sun is /SUBD0:05Mˇpc/NUL3, then the number
density of stars may be estimated as nD/SUB=MD0:098pc/NUL3. The average volume of Galactic space
p e rs t a ri s VspaceD1=n, and the volume of a single M0 star is
VstarD4

The fraction of Galactic space occupied by stars is

VspaceDnVstarD1:2/STX10/NUL24:
(b) If an intruder M0 star travels through the Galactic stars, the mean free path between collisions is given
by Eq. (9.12), `D1=n/ESC, where the collision cross section is
/ESCD/EM.2R/2D2:4/STX1018m2D2:5/STX10/NUL15pc2:
The mean free path is therefore `D1=n/ESCD4:0/STX1015pc. If the thickness of the Galactic disk is
about z/EM1kpc, then the probability of a stellar collision with the intruder star during its perpendicular
passage through the disk is only z=`/EM2:5/STX10/NUL13.
26.2 Assume that the force of dynamical friction is given by a expression of the form
fd'C.GM/˛.vM/ˇ/SUB/CR;

for the cluster’s mass, and vMD220km s/NUL1for the orbital speed of the local standard of rest (Eq. 24.36), we
obtain rmaxD1:2/STX1020mD4kpc. This is similar to the size of the Milky Way’s central bulge (Table 24.1).

(b) The time quoted in the text, some 14 billion years, is about eight times longer than our estimate here.
26.5 Treating the Milky Way and the LMC as a binary system with a separation of dLMCD51kpc, we can
use Eq. (18.10) to estimate the tidal radius of the LMC due to the Milky Way. From Table 24.1, we takeM

26.6 In this problem, we treat the LMC and the SMC as a binary system.

(d) These galaxies lost their gas early in their histories and have ceased forming new stars. Hence they are
now primarily composed of ancient stars.
26.18 (a) At about 210 million years (step 175), a spiral structure begins to develop, becoming clear by 240 million
years (step 200). The appearance of the target and intruder galaxies begins to resemble the Whirlpool
galaxy and its companion as an apparent bridge of stars connecting the two galaxies develops sometimearound 270 million year s (step 225). It r eaches a “best match” between approximately 300 m illion years
(step 250) and 330 million years ( step 275). The apparent bridge begins to fade around 360 million
years (step 300), becomes disrupted by about 420 million years (step 350), and is nearly gone after
about 450 million y ears (step 375).

<<<PAGE 176>>>

176 Chapter 26 Galactic Evolution
(b) Near the end of the 648 million-year time period, the spiral arms begin to dissipate, and many of the
stars have apparently escaped from the central nucleus of the target galaxy.
(c) In this case, the intruder galaxy passes by in a direction opposite to the orbital motion of the stars in the
target galaxy. Small, relatively tight spiral arms begin to develop around 240 million years (step 200),but they tend to wind back up again and are gone by 330 million y ears (step 275). The ﬁnal result is a
galaxy with a disrupted disk. No stars escape from the central nucleus of the target galaxy.
26.19 (a) The initial speed of the intruder galaxy matches the orbital speed of the nearby stars in the outer ring.
Stars behind the intruder gain energy as they are pulled forward and up out of the plane of the disk.They form the “bridge” of stars that appears to link the target galaxy with the intruder. Stars behind theintruder are pulled backward; they lose energy and dr op into lower orbits with larger angular velocities.
As a result, these stars overtake the stars in higher orbits to form a loop of stars. These loops comprise
the spiral arm that develops opposite the “bridge.”
(b) In this case, the intruder galaxy passes by in a direction opposite to the orbital motion of the stars in
the target galaxy. The intruder spends a relatively brief time near any single star, and succeeds only in
pulling a “spike” of stars up out of the plane of the target galaxy. Orbital motion carries the spike away
from the intruder galaxy, and differential rotation causes the development and then the winding up of atight spiral feature. Less energy is transferred to the stars in their short encounter with the intruder, andno stars escape from the gravity of the target nucleus.
26.20 (a) The intruder galaxy pulls rings of stars up and away from the nucleus of the target galaxy. At ﬁrst
these stellar rings contract, and then expand. Such a process could produce a ring galaxy such as theCartwheel.
(b) As the intruder galaxy pulls inward on a star in the ring, the force of gravity does positive work on the
star and increases its energy as the star approaches the target nucleus. The star’s orbit becomes moreenergetic, with a larger semimajor axis (c.f., Eq. 2.35), and it also becomes elongated ( e¤0). After
reaching perigalacticon, the star’s new orbit carries it away from the nucleus, and the ring expands. If
the star gains enough energy, it may no longer be bound to the target nucleus. [To see these effects,rerun the program with just two rings containing one star each, changing v
zfrom /NUL1to/NUL2. Follow the
motion for at least 720 million years (600 steps).]
(c) A nearly head-on collision is usually required to produce a ring galaxy, with values of the initial x-
coordinate ranging from 0 to 2. Although values of 3 or greater typically result in a signi ﬁcant disruption
of the target galaxy, an elliptical ring may be produced by larger values, such as 7.5.

and Baade’s distinction between classical Cepheids and W Virginis stars would not be made until 1952. Hub-ble calculated that his galaxies were closer than their actual distances, so his diagram showed that velocityincreases more rapidly with distance than it actually does.

Observations made at this later time to calculate Mvirial via Eq. (S27.1) would therefore underestimate the

number of recombinations per unit volume per second for the entire volume. We now model the narrow-lineregion as a sphere of radius r

Moving with a speed of vD220km s/NUL1, the MACHO will travel a distance of 2/DC2EdLin a time of tD
2/DC2EdL=vD1:34/STX106sD15:5d. Comparing this time with the time shown in Fig. 24.15, we see that the
temporary brightening of a lensed star in the LMC lasted for roughly 20 days, in good agreement with our
crude estimate.

(c) For a more massive black hole, the star would not be disrupted prior to falling through the event horizon.
As a result, the liberation of the gravitational potential energy would be very inef ﬁcient, meaning that
there would be little gravitational energy available to power an AGN.

29.1 The total number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius r1and thickness /c129rthat contains nstars per unit
volume is N1D4/EMr2
1n/c129r. Assuming stars of luminosity L, the radiant ﬂux received from a single star is,
from the inverse square law (Eq. 3.2),
F1DL
4/EMr2
1:
Therefore, the total ﬂux received from this shell is FtDN1F1DLn/c129r. This is independent of r,s ot h e
same result would be found for a shell of radius r2.
29.2 Assume a WMAP density of baryonic matter of /SUBb;0D4:17/STX10/NUL28kg m/NUL3. Setting the corresponding rest
energy density (Eq. 4.47) equal to the blackbody energy density (Eq. 9.7), we have /SUBb;0c2DaT4. Solving
this for Ttoﬁnd that the temperature of the universe gives
TD/DC2/SUBb;0c2
a/DC31=4
D14:9K:
According to Wien’s law, Eq. (3.15), the blackbody radiation would have a peak wavelength of /NAKmaxD
.0:00290 mK/=TD0:19mm, in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum (Table 3.1). Even if all
of the matter in the universe were converted into the energy of blackbody radiation, there is too little matterto cause the sky to glow. There would not be visually detectable amounts of blackbody radiation at visiblewavelengths.

identical to the one followed for Problem 29.5. The only difference is that because k<0for an open

CHAPTER 30
The Early Universe
30.1 Using Eqs. (9.7) and (9.65) with TD2:725K, the present number density of CBR blackbody photons is
nphoton DaT3=.2:70k/D4:11/STX108m/NUL3. The present number density of baryons in a universe of pure
hydrogen is nb;0D/SUBb;0=mH. With /SUBb;0D4:17/STX10/NUL28kg m/NUL3(Eq. 29.17), nb;0D0:25m/NUL3. The ratio of
the two isnb;0
nphotonD6:08/STX10/NUL10:
There are roughly 1.6 b illion photons for e very baryon in the universe.
30.2 (a) If most of the dark matter in the Milky Way’s dark halo is in the form of ordinary objects such as brown
dwarfs and Jupiter-sized objects, this would favor hot dark matter for the nonbaryonic matter in theuniverse. If the universe were dominated by cold dark matter, it would have also accumulated in the
Galactic dark halo and overwhelmed the contribution of ordinary objects.
(b) If less than 20% of the Milky Way’s dark halo is in the form of ordinary objects, then no conclusion can
be reached. The nonbaryonic matter could be either hot or cold.
30.3 (a) See Fig. S30.1.
(b) By inspection of Fig. S30.1 for kDC1m
/NUL1, there is a point of stable equilibrium at xD0.
(c) For kD/NUL1m/NUL1, the points of equilibrium occur where dV=dxD0,
d
dx/DLE

which has solutions xD0(unstable) and xD˙1(stable).
(d) For the case of kD/NUL1m/NUL1, when the ball is “at rest” at the origin, it is in a symmetric condition
(reﬂection symmetry about the line xD0). However, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, /c129x/c129p/EM/planckover2pi1
(Eq. 5.19), implies that the ball cannot be perfectly at rest. This law of quantum mechanics requires thatthe ball move from its symmetric but unstable equilibrium position at xD0and roll down toward an
unsymmetric, stable position of lower potential energy at either xDC1orxD/NUL1. In an analogous
manner, the universe was initially in a supercooled false vacuum state of unbroken symmetry. Then a
quantum ﬂuctuation governed by the uncertainty principle caused a transition to a lower energy state of
broken symmetry, the true vacuum.
30.4 The end of the GUTs epoch occurred when the temperature was approximately T/CAN10
28K. The energy
density of blackbody radiation at that temperature is (Eq. 9.7) uDaT4/CAN8/STX1096Jm/NUL3. Comparing this
with the energy density of the false vacuum, ufv/EM1098Jm/NUL3(Eq. 30.9), and considering the crude nature
of this estimate, these two energy densities can be described as being of the same order of magnitude.
30.5 The Planck time is tpD5:39/STX10/NUL44s (Eq. 30.3). According to standard Big-Bang cosmology, the scale
factor at that time (deep in the radiation era) was, from Eq. (29.87),

But before recombination, the Jeans mass was also proportional to T/NUL3(Fig. 30.7). This means that the
value of mbremained about an order of magnitude smaller than the Jeans mass throughout the radiation
era.
30.8 ( Note: An oversight occurred in the ﬁrst printing of An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics ;t h eW M A P

Eq. (29.84) shows that the transition from the radiation era to the matter era ( RDRr;m) occurred at about
tr;mD1:74/STX1012sD5:52/STX104yr (WMAP values) :
At that time the scale factor was Rr;mD3:05/STX10/NUL4according to WMAP values. According to Eq. (29. 154)
the horizon distance was dhD2ctD1:04/STX1021m. Furthermore, the density of baryonic matter was
/SUBbD/SUBb;0=R3D1:47/STX10/NUL17kg m/NUL3(using Eq. 29.5 with /SUBb;0D4:17/STX10/NUL28kg m/NUL3from Eq. 29.17).

This is a very large mass, comparable to that of a large cluster of galaxies. Assuming that a typical baryonic
density ﬂuctuation was less massive than this, we conclude that most of the baryonic density ﬂuctuations
became sub-horizon-sized by the end of the radiation era.
