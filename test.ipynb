      "Solution:\n",
      "The limit of the sequence defined by an = 1/n as n approaches infinity is 0. As n increases, the value of 1/n gets closer and closer to 0.\n",

      "Question 2:\n",
      "How does the sequence an = 1/n behave as n increases?\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution:\n",
      "As n increases, the sequence an = 1/n decreases in value and approaches 0. This means that the terms of the sequence get smaller and closer to 0 as n becomes larger.\n",

      "Hints:\n",
      "1. Start by evaluating the sequence for a few specific values of n, such as n = 1, 2, 3, and\n",
