This will help you understand the significance of the electron's mass in the context of hydrogen.\", \"Think about the concept of mass ratios. How does the mass of the electron compare to the mass of the proton? You might want to look up the actual mass values and calculate the ratio to see how small the electron's mass is in comparison.\", \"Consider the implications of the electron's mass on the behavior of the hydrogen atom, such as its energy levels and stability. How does the mass influence the electron's movement and the overall properties of hydrogen?\"]\n",
