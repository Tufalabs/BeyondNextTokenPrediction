       "\"<question>What is the form of the potential energy \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) \\\\) for two bodies interacting through a conservative central force, and how does it relate to the relative position \\\\( r \\\\) of the two bodies?</question>\\n<solution>The potential energy \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) \\\\) for two bodies interacting through a conservative central force can be expressed as a function of the distance between them, specifically as \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) = U(|r_1 - r_2|) \\\\). This means that the potential energy depends only on the magnitude of the relative position \\\\( r = r_1 - r_2 \\\\), and can be simplified to \\\\( U = U(r) \\\\). This is due to the translational invariance of the system, which implies that the potential energy does not depend on the absolute positions \\\\( r_1 \\\\) and \\\\( r_2 \\\\) but only on their separation.</solution>\\n\\n<question>Using the gravitational potential energy formula \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) = -\\\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{|r_1 - r_2|} \\\\), derive the expression for the force \\\\( F_{12} \\\\) exerted by mass \\\\( m_1 \\\\) on mass \\\\( m_2 \\\\).</question>\\n<solution>To derive the force \\\\( F_{12} \\\\) from the potential energy \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) \\\\), we use the relation \\\\( F_{12} = -\\\\nabla U \\\\). In one dimension, this simplifies to \\\\( F_{12} = -\\\\frac{dU}{dr} \\\\). \\n\\nStarting with the gravitational potential energy:\\n\\\\[\\nU(r_1, r_2) = -\\\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{|r_1 - r_2|},\\n\\\\]\\nwe differentiate with respect to \\\\( r \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nF_{12} = -\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}\\\\right) = -\\\\left(\\\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\\\right).\\n\\\\]\\nThus, the force exerted by mass \\\\( m_1 \\\\) on mass \\\\( m_2 \\\\) is:\\n\\\\[\\nF_{12} = \\\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}.\\n\\\\]\\nThis is the gravitational force acting between the two masses.</solution>\\n\\n<question>Explain the significance of the reduced mass in the context of two-body problems and derive the expression for the reduced mass \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) in terms of the masses \\\\( m_1 \\\\) and \\\\( m_2 \\\\).</question>\\n<solution>The reduced mass \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is a useful concept in two-body problems as it simplifies the analysis of the motion of two interacting bodies. It allows us to treat the two-body problem as an equivalent one-body problem with a single particle of mass \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) moving in the potential created by the other body.\\n\\nThe expression for the reduced mass \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is given by:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mu = \\\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}.\\n\\\\]\\nThis formula arises from the need to account for the inertia of both bodies in the system. By substituting \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) into the equations of motion, we can analyze the dynamics of the system more easily.</solution>\\n\\n<question>Given the potential energy of a hydrogen atom \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) = -\\\\frac{ke^2}{|r_1 - r_2|} \\\\), calculate the force acting on the electron due to the proton.</question>\\n<solution>To find the force acting on the electron due to the proton, we use the relation \\\\( F = -\\\\nabla U \\\\). For the potential energy given by:\\n\\\\[\\nU(r_1, r_2) = -\\\\frac{ke^2}{|r_1 - r_2|},\\n\\\\]\\nwe differentiate with respect to \\\\( r \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nF = -\\\\frac{dU}{dr} = -\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{ke^2}{r}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{ke^2}{r^2}.\\n\\\\]\\nThus, the force acting on the electron due to the proton is:\\n\\\\[\\nF = \\\\frac{ke^2}{r^2}.\\n\\\\]\\nThis is the Coulomb force acting between the two charges.</solution>\\n\\n<question>Discuss the implications of translational invariance in the context of the two-body problem and how it leads to the dependence of potential energy on the relative position.</question>\\n<solution>Translational invariance implies that the laws of physics remain unchanged regardless of the position of the system in space. In the context of the two-body problem, this means that the potential energy \\\\( U(r_1, r_2) \\\\) cannot depend on the absolute positions \\\\( r_1 \\\\) and \\\\( r_2 \\\\) of the two bodies, but only on their separation \\\\( r = |r_1 - r_2| \\\\). \\n\\nThis leads to the conclusion that the potential energy can be expressed as \\\\( U(r) \\\\), which simplifies the analysis of the system. The forces acting between the bodies are derived from this potential energy, and since it depends only on the relative position, the dynamics can be analyzed using a single variable, making the problem more tractable.</solution>\\n\\n<question>Using the Lagrangian \\\\( L = \\\\frac{1}{2} m_1 \\\\dot{r_1}^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} m_2 \\\\dot{r_2}^2 - U(r) \\\\), derive the equations of motion for the two-body system.</question>\\n<solution>To derive the equations of motion from the Lagrangian \\\\( L = \\\\frac{1}{2} m_1 \\\\dot{r_1}^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} m_2 \\\\dot{r_2}^2 - U(r) \\\\), we apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q} = 0,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\( q \\\\) represents the generalized coordinates \\\\( r_1 \\\\) and \\\\( r_2 \\\\).\\n\\nFor \\\\( r_1 \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial r_1} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial r_1},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r_1}} = m_1 \\\\dot{r_1}.\\n\\\\]\\nThus,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt}(m_1 \\\\dot{r_1}) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial r_1}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFor \\\\( r_2 \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial r_2} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial r_2},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r_2}} = m_2 \\\\dot{r_2}.\\n\\\\]\\nThus,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt}(m_2 \\\\dot{r_2}) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial r_2}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThese equations represent the equations of motion for the two-body system, showing how the forces derived from the potential energy influence the motion of each body.</solution>\\n\\n<question>What is the significance of the central force in the context of the two-body problem, and how does it affect the motion of the bodies involved?</question>\\n<solution>The significance of a central force in the two-body problem lies in its dependence solely on the distance between the two bodies and its direction being along the line connecting them. This characteristic leads to several important implications for the motion of the bodies:\\n\\n1. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: Since the force is central, it does not exert a torque about the center of mass of the system, leading to the conservation of angular momentum. This means that the motion of the bodies can be analyzed in a plane, simplifying the problem.\\n\\n2. **Closed Orbits**: In the case of gravitational or electrostatic forces, the central force leads to predictable, closed orbits (e.g., elliptical orbits in the case of planets and stars), which can be described by Kepler's laws.\\n\\n3. **Reduced Mass**: The concept of reduced mass allows us to treat the two-body problem as a one-body problem, making it easier to analyze the dynamics of the system.\\n\\nOverall, the central force simplifies the analysis of the motion and allows for the derivation of important physical laws governing the behavior of the system.</solution>\\n\\n<question>Given the potential energy of a diatomic molecule as \\\\( U(r) = -\\\\frac{D}{r^n} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\) are constants, derive the expression for the force acting between the two atoms.</question>\\n<solution>To derive the force acting between the two atoms from the potential energy \\\\( U(r) = -\\\\frac{D}{r^n} \\\\), we use the relation \\\\( F = -\\\\nabla U \\\\). In one dimension, this simplifies to:\\n\\\\[\\nF = -\\\\frac{dU}{dr}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nDifferentiating the potential energy with respect to \\\\( r \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nF = -\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{D}{r^n}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{D n}{r^{n+1}}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the force acting between the two atoms is given by:\\n\\\\[\\nF = \\\\frac{D n}{r^{n+1}}.\\n\\\\]\\nThis expression indicates that the force varies with the distance \\\\( r \\\\) raised to the power of \\\\( -(n+1) \\\\), reflecting the nature of the interaction between the atoms in the diatomic molecule.</solution>\\n\\n<question>How does the concept of relative position \\\\( r = r_1 - r_2 \\\\) simplify the analysis of the two-body problem, and what are the implications for the equations of motion?</question>\\n<solution>The concept of relative position \\\\( r = r_1 - r_2 \\\\) simplifies the analysis of the two-body problem by reducing the number of variables involved. Instead of dealing with the individual motions of both bodies, we can focus on their relative motion, which is governed by the potential energy that depends only on the magnitude of \\\\( r \\\\).\\n\\nThe implications for the equations of motion are significant:\\n1. **Single Variable Dynamics**: The motion of the system can be described using a single variable \\\\( r \\\\), which represents the distance between the two bodies. This reduces the complexity of the problem.\\n\\n2. **Simplified Lagrangian**: The Lagrangian can be expressed in terms of the relative position and the reduced mass, allowing us to derive the equations of motion more easily.\\n\\n3. **Conservation Laws**: The relative position leads to conservation laws (e.g., conservation of momentum and angular momentum) that apply to the system as a whole, making it easier to analyze the dynamics.\\n\\nOverall, the use of relative position streamlines the analysis and allows for a clearer understanding of the interactions and motions of the two bodies involved in the system.</solution>\""
