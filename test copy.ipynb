      "Millikan measured the charge on oil droplets falling in an electric field and found that it was always a whole-number multiple of -1.60 x 10^-19 C, which is the charge of a single electron. He determined this by measuring the strength of the electric field required to halt the free fall of the negatively charged droplets and calculating the charge based on the mass of the droplets, which he derived from their radii and density.\n",
      "['Start by reviewing the concept of electric charge and how it can be quantified. Consider what it means for a charge to be a whole-number multiple and how this relates to the fundamental charge of an electron.', 'Think about the experimental setup Millikan used with the oil droplets. Focus on the forces acting on the droplets and the equations that describe the balance between gravitational force and electric force.', 'Once you understand the forces involved, consider how Millikan was able to measure the charge on individual droplets and what calculations he performed to show that these charges were consistent with being multiples of a fundamental charge value.']\n",

      "J.J. Thomson measured the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron by using electric and magnetic fields to deflect an electron beam in a cathode ray tube. He adjusted the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields until their effects canceled each other out, resulting in an undeflected beam. By knowing the strengths of the fields at this point of cancellation, he was able to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron.\n",

What role do these fields play in determining the motion of charged particles?\", 'Think about the equations that relate the force exerted by electric and magnetic fields on a charged particle. Specifically, focus on the Lorentz force equation and how it can be used to express the balance of forces acting on the electron.', \"Once you have a grasp of the forces involved, consider how Thomson might have measured the radius of the electron's path in the magnetic field. This measurement will be crucial for calculating the charge-to-mass ratio. What relationships can you derive from the circular motion of the electrons?\"]\n",

      "The mass of the electron, calculated to be approximately 9.10 x 10^-28 g, is significant because it is about 2000 times less than the mass of hydrogen, which is the lightest atom. This comparison highlights the fundamental nature of the electron as a building block of matter, emphasizing its relatively small mass in contrast to atomic structures.\n",

This will help you understand the significance of the electron's mass in the context of hydrogen.\", \"Think about the concept of mass ratios. How does the mass of the electron compare to the mass of the proton? You might want to look up the actual mass values and calculate the ratio to see how small the electron's mass is in comparison.\", \"Consider the implications of the electron's mass on the behavior of the hydrogen atom, such as its energy levels and stability.
