He determined this by measuring the strength of the electric field required to halt the free fall of the negatively charged droplets and calculating the charge based on the mass of the droplets, which he derived from their radii and density.\n",

Consider what it means for a charge to be a whole-number multiple and how this relates to the fundamental charge of an electron.', 'Think about the experimental setup Millikan used with the oil droplets.

He adjusted the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields until their effects canceled each other out, resulting in an undeflected beam. By knowing the strengths of the fields at this point of cancellation, he was able to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron.\n",

Specifically, focus on the Lorentz force equation and how it can be used to express the balance of forces acting on the electron.', \"Once you have a grasp of the forces involved, consider how Thomson might have measured the radius of the electron's path in the magnetic field.

This comparison highlights the fundamental nature of the electron as a building block of matter, emphasizing its relatively small mass in contrast to atomic structures.\n",
