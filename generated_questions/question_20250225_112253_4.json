    "question": "In a scenario where the host always reveals a non-prize curtain, if you initially choose curtain A, what is the probability that the prize is behind curtain B after the host reveals curtain C?",
    "solution": "If you initially chose curtain A, the probability that the prize is behind curtain B after the host reveals curtain C (which does not have the prize) is 1/3 (initial probability of A) + 1/3 (the probability of B given that C was revealed). Therefore, the probability that the prize is behind curtain B is:\n\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{1/3 + 1/3}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{2/3}{2/3} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the prize is behind curtain B is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]",
