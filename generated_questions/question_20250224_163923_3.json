    "question": "Using Thomson's mass-to-charge ratio, derive the mass of the electron and discuss the implications of this value in the context of atomic structure and the stability of matter.",
    "solution": "Thomson's mass-to-charge ratio for electrons is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{q} = -\\frac{9.10 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ g}}{-1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}} = 5.68 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ g/C}\n\\]\n\nTo find the mass \\( m \\) of the electron, we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nm = q \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m}{q}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\nm = -1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C} \\cdot 5.68 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ g/C} = 9.10 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ g}\n\\]\n\nThe mass of the electron, approximately \\( 9.10 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ g} \\), is about 2000 times less than that of hydrogen, the lightest atom. This small mass is crucial for the stability of atoms, as it allows electrons to occupy quantized energy levels around the nucleus without collapsing into it due to gravitational forces. The electron's mass and charge determine the electromagnetic forces that govern atomic interactions, influencing chemical bonding and the properties of materials. Thus, understanding the mass of the electron is fundamental to the study of atomic structure and the behavior of matter at the microscopic level.",
