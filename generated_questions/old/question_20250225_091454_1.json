    "source": "Three clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. Given that each monkey receives a whole number of bananas whenever the bananas are divided, and the numbers of bananas the first, second, and third monkeys have at the end of the process are in the ratio 3 : 2 : 1, what is the least possible total for the number of bananas?",
    "question": "Consider a scenario where three monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes a portion of the bananas, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes another portion, keeps one-fourth, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas, keeps one-twelfth, and divides the rest equally between the other two. If each monkey ends up with a whole number of bananas and the final number of bananas each monkey has is in the ratio 3:2:1, determine the least possible total number of bananas in the pile.",
    "solution": "Let the total number of bananas be \\( B \\). Let \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) be the number of bananas taken by the first, second, and third monkeys, respectively. The conditions are:\n\n1. The first monkey keeps \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\) bananas and gives \\( \\frac{1}{8}x \\) to each of the other two monkeys.\n2. The second monkey keeps \\( \\frac{1}{4}y \\) bananas and gives \\( \\frac{3}{8}y \\) to each of the other two monkeys.\n3. The third monkey keeps \\( \\frac{1}{12}z \\) bananas and gives \\( \\frac{11}{24}z \\) to each of the other two monkeys.\n\nThe total number of bananas is \\( B = x + y + z \\).\n\nThe final number of bananas each monkey has is:\n- First monkey: \\( \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{3}{8}y + \\frac{11}{24}z \\)\n- Second monkey: \\( \\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{1}{4}y + \\frac{11}{24}z \\)\n- Third monkey: \\( \\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{3}{8}y + \\frac{1}{12}z \\)\n\nThese quantities are in the ratio 3:2:1. Let the number of bananas for the first, second, and third monkeys be \\( 3k \\), \\( 2k \\), and \\( k \\) respectively. We have the equations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{3}{8}y + \\frac{11}{24}z = 3k\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{1}{4}y + \\frac{11}{24}z = 2k\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{3}{8}y + \\frac{1}{12}z = k\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find that the smallest integer solution for \\( k \\) that satisfies all conditions is \\( k = 24 \\). Substituting back, we find \\( x = 72 \\), \\( y = 48 \\), and \\( z = 24 \\).\n\nThus, the least possible total number of bananas is:\n\\[\nB = x + y + z = 72 + 48 + 24 = \\boxed{144}\n\\]",
