    "solution": "To derive the expressions for the universal variables \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) from the equations provided, we start with the equations for \\( f \\) and \\( g \\):\n\n1. From equation (5.3-1):\n   \\[\n   f = 1 - \\frac{r_2}{p}(1 - \\cos \\delta v)\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   1 - f = \\frac{r_2}{p}(1 - \\cos \\delta v)\n   \\]\n   Thus, we can express \\( x \\) as:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{r_1 r_2 (1 - \\cos \\delta v)}{pC} \\quad \\text{(5.3-5)}\n   \\]\n\n2. The variable \\( z \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   z = \\delta E^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta E \\) is related to the angular momentum and energy of the orbit.\n\nThe implications of these universal variables in orbital mechanics are significant:\n\n- **Simplification**: The use of universal variables allows for a more straightforward formulation of the equations governing orbital motion, reducing the complexity associated with varying parameters.\n  \n- **General Applicability**: These variables can be applied across different types of orbits (e.g., elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic), making them versatile tools in astrodynamics.\n\n- **Numerical Stability**: The universal variable formulation can enhance numerical stability in computations, particularly when dealing with close approaches or high eccentricity orbits.\n\nIn summary, the derivation of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) from the equations provided illustrates their foundational role in simplifying and enhancing the analysis of orbital mechanics.",
