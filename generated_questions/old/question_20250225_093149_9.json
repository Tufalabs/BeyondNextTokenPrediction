    "question": "A rectangle has dimensions 6 units by 8 units. A point is chosen at random inside the rectangle. What is the probability that the point lies within a circle of radius 3 units centered at one of the rectangle's corners?",
    "solution": "The area of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of rectangle} = 6 \\times 8 = 48. \\]\n\nThe area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of circle} = \\pi \\times 3^2 = 9\\pi. \\]\n\nThe probability that the point lies within the circle is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{9\\pi}{48}. \\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{9\\pi}{48}}\\).",
