    "solution": "Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets, we can calculate |A1 \u222a A2| using the formula:\n\n|A1 \u222a A2| = |A1| + |A2| - |A1 \u2229 A2|.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n|A1 \u222a A2| = 8 + 10 - 4 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the union of the two sets is boxed{14}.",
