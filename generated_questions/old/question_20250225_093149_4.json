    "question": "A point is chosen at random inside a square with side length 4. What is the probability that the point lies within a circle of radius 2 centered at the center of the square?",
    "solution": "The area of the square is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of square} = 4 \\times 4 = 16. \\]\n\nThe area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of circle} = \\pi \\times 2^2 = 4\\pi. \\]\n\nThe probability that the point lies within the circle is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{4\\pi}{16} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}. \\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\).",
