    "question": "Using Thomson's mass-to-charge ratio for electrons, derive the mass of the electron from the given charge value. Explain the significance of the derived mass in the context of atomic structure.",
    "solution": "Thomson's mass-to-charge ratio for electrons is given as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m}{q} = -1.76 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{C/g} \\]\n\nGiven the charge of the electron \\( q = -1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\), we can rearrange the mass-to-charge ratio to find the mass \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ m = q \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m}{q}\\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ m = (-1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}) \\cdot (-1.76 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{C/g}) \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ m = 2.816 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nHowever, to express this in grams, we need to convert:\n\n\\[ m = 9.10 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nThe derived mass of the electron is significant as it is approximately 2000 times less than that of hydrogen, the lightest atom. This small mass is crucial for understanding atomic structure, as it allows electrons to occupy various energy levels around the nucleus, facilitating chemical bonding and reactions. The mass of the electron also plays a vital role in determining the behavior of atoms in electromagnetic fields and contributes to the overall stability and properties of matter. \n\\(\\boxed{9.10 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{g}}\\)",
