    "question": "In what scenarios is geometric probability particularly useful, and why?",
    "solution": "Geometric probability is particularly useful in scenarios where the number of possible outcomes is infinite. This is because traditional counting methods may not apply effectively when dealing with continuous outcomes. For example, when calculating the probability of a point landing within a certain area or volume, geometric probability allows for the measurement of the area or volume in question, providing a more accurate representation of the likelihood of outcomes.",
