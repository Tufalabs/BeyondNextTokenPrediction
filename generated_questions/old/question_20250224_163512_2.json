    "question": "Using the principles outlined in Millikan's experiment, derive the relationship between the electric field strength (E), the charge (q) of the oil droplet, and the mass (m) of the droplet. Assume the droplet is in equilibrium under the influence of gravity and the electric field.",
    "solution": "In Millikan's experiment, the oil droplet experiences two forces when subjected to an electric field: the gravitational force (weight) acting downward and the electric force acting upward. At equilibrium, these forces are equal in magnitude.\n\n1. The gravitational force (F_gravity) acting on the droplet is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{gravity}} = mg\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the droplet and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)).\n\n2. The electric force (F_electric) acting on the droplet in the electric field is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{electric}} = qE\n   \\]\n   where \\( q \\) is the charge of the droplet and \\( E \\) is the strength of the electric field.\n\nAt equilibrium, these forces balance each other:\n\\[\nmg = qE\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation gives us the relationship between the charge of the droplet, the electric field strength, and the mass of the droplet:\n\\[\nq = \\frac{mg}{E}\n\\]\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the charge of the droplet if the mass and the electric field strength are known. It also illustrates how the charge-to-mass ratio can be determined experimentally, reinforcing the significance of Millikan's work in understanding the properties of electrons and their role in atomic structure.",
