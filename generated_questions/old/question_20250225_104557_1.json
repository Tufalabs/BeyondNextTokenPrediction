    "solution": "The expected value \\( E \\) of a single roll of a fair six-sided die can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 4 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 5 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected value is \\( \\boxed{3.5} \\).",
