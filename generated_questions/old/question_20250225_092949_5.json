    "question": "If set A1 has 10 elements, set A2 has 15 elements, and the intersection of A1 and A2 has 5 elements, what is the total number of elements in the union of sets A1 and A2 using the principle of inclusion and exclusion?",
    "solution": "Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets, we can calculate the union as follows:\n\n|A1 \u222a A2| = |A1| + |A2| \u2212 |A1 \u2229 A2|.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n|A1 \u222a A2| = 10 + 15 \u2212 5 = 20.\n\nThus, the total number of elements in the union of sets A1 and A2 is boxed{20}.",
