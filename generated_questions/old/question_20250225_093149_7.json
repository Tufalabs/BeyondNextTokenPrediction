    "question": "If a fair six-sided die is rolled three times, what is the expected value of the sum of the numbers rolled?",
    "solution": "The expected value of a single dice roll is 3.5. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of the sum of three independent dice rolls is the sum of their individual expected values:\n\n\\[ E(X_1 + X_2 + X_3) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) + E(X_3) = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 = 10.5. \\]\n\nThus, the expected value of the sum of the numbers rolled is \\(\\boxed{10.5}\\).",
