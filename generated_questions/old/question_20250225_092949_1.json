    "question": "What is the expected value of the sum of two independent dice rolls, given that the expected value of a single dice roll is 3.5?",
    "solution": "To find the expected value of the sum of two independent dice rolls, we can use the linearity of expectation. \n\nLet E(x1) be the expected value of the first dice roll and E(x2) be the expected value of the second dice roll. \n\nSince both rolls are independent and each has an expected value of 3.5, we have:\n\nE(x1 + x2) = E(x1) + E(x2) = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7.\n\nThus, the expected value of the sum of two independent dice rolls is boxed{7}.",
