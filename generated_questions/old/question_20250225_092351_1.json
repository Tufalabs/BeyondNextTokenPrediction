    "source": "Three clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. Given that each monkey receives a whole number of bananas whenever the bananas are divided, and the numbers of bananas the first, second, and third monkeys have at the end of the process are in the ratio 3 : 2 : 1, what is the least possible total for the number of bananas?",
    "question": "Given the conditions of the banana division among three monkeys, where the first monkey keeps three-fourths of the bananas it takes, the second keeps one-fourth, and the third keeps one-twelfth, and their final amounts are in the ratio 3:2:1, determine the least possible total number of bananas in the pile.",
    "solution": "Let the total number of bananas be \\( N \\). \n\nLet \\( x_1 \\), \\( x_2 \\), and \\( x_3 \\) be the number of bananas taken by the first, second, and third monkeys, respectively. The first monkey keeps \\( \\frac{3}{4}x_1 \\) and gives \\( \\frac{1}{4}x_1 \\) to each of the other two monkeys. The second monkey keeps \\( \\frac{1}{4}x_2 \\) and gives \\( \\frac{3}{4}x_2 \\) to the other two monkeys. The third monkey keeps \\( \\frac{1}{12}x_3 \\) and gives \\( \\frac{11}{12}x_3 \\) to the other two monkeys.\n\nThe final amounts for each monkey can be expressed as:\n- First monkey: \\( \\frac{3}{4}x_1 + \\frac{3}{8}x_2 + \\frac{11}{24}x_3 \\)\n- Second monkey: \\( \\frac{1}{4}x_1 + \\frac{1}{8}x_2 + \\frac{11}{24}x_3 \\)\n- Third monkey: \\( \\frac{1}{4}x_1 + \\frac{3}{8}x_2 + \\frac{1}{12}x_3 \\)\n\nSetting the ratios:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{3}{4}x_1 + \\frac{3}{8}x_2 + \\frac{11}{24}x_3}{\\frac{1}{4}x_1 + \\frac{1}{8}x_2 + \\frac{11}{24}x_3} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}x_1 + \\frac{1}{8}x_2 + \\frac{11}{24}x_3}{\\frac{1}{4}x_1 + \\frac{3}{8}x_2 + \\frac{1}{12}x_3} = \\frac{2}{1}\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations leads to the conclusion that \\( N \\) must be a multiple of 24. The least possible total number of bananas that satisfies all conditions is \\( \\boxed{24} \\).",
