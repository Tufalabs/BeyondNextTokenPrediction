    "solution": "To find the expected distance between two points, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nD = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this value:\n\n\\[\nD \\approx \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3.14159}} \\approx \\frac{2}{1.77245} \\approx 1.12838\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected distance \\( D \\) is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.1284}\n\\]",
