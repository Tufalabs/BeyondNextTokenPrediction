    "solution": "To find the average of the simulations, we sum all the recorded values and then divide by the number of values.\n\nSum = 20.97 + 21.14 + 23.16 + 22.48 + 22.20 + 23.59 + 20.07 + 21.79 + 23.21 + 20.63 + 22.32 + 22.33 =  264.88\n\nNumber of values = 12\n\nAverage = Sum / Number of values = 264.88 / 12 = 22.07\n\nThus, the average of the simulations is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{22.07}\n\\]",
