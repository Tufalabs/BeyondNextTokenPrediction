    "solution": "From the table for 999 intervals, the number of cases for the digit '7' is given as 60,321. The total number of cases is 999,999. To find the percentage of cases for the digit '7', we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of cases for digit '7'}}{\\text{Total number of cases}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{60,321}{999,999} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 6.0321\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of cases for the digit '7' is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.03}\n\\]",
