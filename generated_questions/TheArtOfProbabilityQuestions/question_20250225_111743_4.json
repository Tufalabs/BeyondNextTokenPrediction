    "question": "In the context of the expected distance between two points chosen from a normal distribution, if the variance is 1, what is the expected distance expressed as \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\) in decimal form?",
    "solution": "To express the expected distance \\( D = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\) in decimal form, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nD \\approx \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3.14159}} \\approx \\frac{2}{1.77245} \\approx 1.12838\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected distance \\( D \\) in decimal form is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.1284}\n\\]",
