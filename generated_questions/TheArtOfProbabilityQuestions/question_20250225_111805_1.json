    "question": "In a state diagram representing the distribution of the number of tosses of a coin until two heads appear in a row, there are three states: S1 (T, tail), S2 (H, head), and S3 (HH, two heads in a row). If the transition probabilities from S1 to S2 and from S2 to S3 are both 0.5, and the transition probability from S1 to S1 is 0.5, what is the expected number of tosses required to reach state S3 (two heads in a row) starting from state S1?",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of tosses required to reach state S3 from state S1, we can set up the following equations based on the expected values:\n\nLet \\( E_1 \\) be the expected number of tosses starting from S1, \\( E_2 \\) be the expected number of tosses starting from S2, and \\( E_3 = 0 \\) since reaching S3 means we stop.\n\nFrom state S1:\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5E_2\n\\]\n\nFrom state S2:\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5E_3\n\\]\nSince \\( E_3 = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 0.5E_1\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( E_2 \\) into the equation for \\( E_1 \\):\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5(1 + 0.5E_1)\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5 + 0.25E_1\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = 1.5 + 0.75E_1\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 - 0.75E_1 = 1.5\n\\]\n\\[\n0.25E_1 = 1.5\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = \\frac{1.5}{0.25} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of tosses required to reach state S3 starting from state S1 is \n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
