    "question": "If the ball bounces off the edge of a hole and travels horizontally for 2 meters before hitting the next edge of another hole, how many holes does it pass if the distance between each hole is 0.4 meters?",
    "solution": "To find the number of holes the ball passes, we divide the total distance traveled by the distance between holes.\n\nTotal distance = 2 meters.\nDistance between holes = 0.4 meters.\n\nNumber of holes = total distance / distance between holes = 2 m / 0.4 m = 5 holes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
