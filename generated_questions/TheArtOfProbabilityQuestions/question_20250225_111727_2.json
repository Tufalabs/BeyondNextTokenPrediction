    "question": "Using the convolution method described in the text, if you roll three six-sided dice, what is the coefficient of \\(x^9\\) in the generating function that represents the sum of the outcomes of the three dice?",
    "solution": "The generating function for a single die is given by:\n\n\\[\nG(t) = t + t^2 + t^3 + t^4 + t^5 + t^6 = t \\frac{1 - t^6}{1 - t}\n\\]\n\nFor three dice, we need to cube this generating function:\n\n\\[\nG(t)^3 = \\left(t \\frac{1 - t^6}{1 - t}\\right)^3 = t^3 \\frac{(1 - t^6)^3}{(1 - t)^3}\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(x^9\\), we need the coefficient of \\(t^6\\) in \\((1 - t^6)^3\\) and the coefficient of \\(t^3\\) in \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - t)^3}\\).\n\nExpanding \\((1 - t^6)^3\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n1 - 3t^6 + 3t^{12} - t^{18}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(t^6\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\nThe series expansion of \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - t)^3}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n+2}{2} t^n\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(t^3\\) is \\(\\binom{3+2}{2} = 15\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(t^9\\) in \\(G(t)^3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-3 \\times 15 = -45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(x^9\\) in the generating function for the sum of the outcomes of three dice is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-45}.\n\\]",
