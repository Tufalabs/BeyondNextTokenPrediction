    "question": "If a ball is rolling towards a hole and the angle of incidence is 30 degrees, what is the angle of reflection according to the law of reflection?",
    "solution": "According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, if the angle of incidence is 30 degrees, the angle of reflection will also be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle of reflection} = \\text{Angle of incidence} = 30 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\nThus, the angle of reflection is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30} \\text{ degrees}.\n\\]",
