    "question": "If you have 5 distinct items and you want to place them in 10 slots, how many different ways can this be done?",
    "solution": "To find the number of ways to place 5 distinct items in 10 slots, we can use the formula for permutations where \\( n \\) is the number of slots and \\( k \\) is the number of items to place.\n\nThe formula is given by \\( P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\).\n\nHere, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\):\n\\[\nP(10, 5) = \\frac{10!}{(10-5)!} = \\frac{10!}{5!} = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 30240\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to place the items is \\(\\boxed{30240}\\).",
