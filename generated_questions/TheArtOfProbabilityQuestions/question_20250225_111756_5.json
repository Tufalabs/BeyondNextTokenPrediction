    "question": "In a series of 80 independent trials, if the probability of success in each trial is 0.25, what is the expected number of successes?",
    "solution": "The expected number of successes \\( E \\) in a series of trials is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nE = n \\cdot p\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n = 80 \\) and \\( p = 0.25 \\). Thus,\n\n\\[\nE = 80 \\cdot 0.25 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of successes in 80 trials is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
