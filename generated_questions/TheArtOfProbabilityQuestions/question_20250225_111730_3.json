    "question": "In a scenario where you have 15 distinct books and you want to arrange 5 of them on a shelf, how many different arrangements can you make?",
    "solution": "To find the number of arrangements of 5 books selected from 15 distinct books, we use the permutation formula:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \\ldots (n - k + 1)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( n = 15 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\). Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nP(15, 5) = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( 15 \\times 14 = 210 \\)\n2. \\( 210 \\times 13 = 2730 \\)\n3. \\( 2730 \\times 12 = 32760 \\)\n4. \\( 32760 \\times 11 = 360360 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of different arrangements is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{360360}\n\\]",
