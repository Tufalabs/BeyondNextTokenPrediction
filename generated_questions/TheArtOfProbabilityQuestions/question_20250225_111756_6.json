    "question": "If a random variable has a variance of 16, what is the standard deviation of this variable?",
    "solution": "The standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) is the square root of the variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\). Given that the variance is 16, we calculate the standard deviation as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the standard deviation of the variable is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
