    "solution": "The range of probabilities that can be assigned to the event is directly given by the fuzzy probability range. Therefore, the probabilities can be assigned as follows:\n\nLower Bound = 0.4  \nUpper Bound = 0.9  \n\nThus, the range of probabilities is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[0.4, 0.9]}\n\\]",
