    "question": "A random number is chosen in the unit interval \\( 0 < x < 1 \\). What is the probability that the area of a circle with this radius is less than 1?",
    "solution": "The area \\( A \\) of a circle with radius \\( x \\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\pi x^2\n\\]\n\nWe want to find the probability that this area is less than 1:\n\\[\n\\pi x^2 < 1 \\implies x^2 < \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\implies x < \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that \\( x \\) falls within this range in the unit interval is:\n\\[\nP = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer for the probability is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}}\n\\]",
