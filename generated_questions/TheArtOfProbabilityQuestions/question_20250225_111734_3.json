    "solution": "From the table for 99 intervals, the total number of cases is given as 9999. The number of cases for the digit '3' is 1426. To find the percentage of cases for the digit '3', we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of cases for digit '3'}}{\\text{Total number of cases}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{1426}{9999} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 14.546\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of cases for the digit '3' is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14.55}\n\\]",
