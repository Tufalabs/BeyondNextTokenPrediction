    "question": "In a bag containing 2 red, 3 white, and 4 black balls, what is the probability of drawing all the red balls first, followed by all the white balls, and finally all the black balls in that specific order?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing all the red balls first, then all the white balls, and finally all the black balls, we first need to determine the total number of balls in the bag. \n\nThe total number of balls is:\n- Red: 2\n- White: 3\n- Black: 4\n\nTotal = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 balls.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 9 balls is given by the factorial of the total number of balls, which is \\(9!\\).\n\nHowever, since we want all red balls to be drawn first, all white balls second, and all black balls last, we only have one specific arrangement that satisfies this condition. \n\nThus, the probability \\(P\\) is given by:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{9!} \\cdot \\text{(ways to arrange red, white, and black balls)}\n\\]\nSince there is only one way to arrange them in the desired order, we have:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{9!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(9!\\):\n\\[\n9! = 362880\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{362880}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{362880}}\n\\]",
