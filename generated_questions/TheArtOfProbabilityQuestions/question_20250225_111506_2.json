    "question": "If the host reveals a curtain that does not have the prize behind it, and you initially chose curtain A, what is the probability that the prize is behind one of the other two curtains (B or C)?",
    "solution": "Since the total probability must equal 1, and we have already established that the probability of the prize being behind curtain A is 1/3, the probability that the prize is behind either curtain B or C is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = 1 - \\text{Probability of A} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]",
