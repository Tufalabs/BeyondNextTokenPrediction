    "solution": "The expected gain for the second player is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Gain} = \\frac{x}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0.1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Gain} = \\frac{0.1}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} \\approx 0.1111\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected gain when \\( x = 0.1 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.1111}\n\\]",
