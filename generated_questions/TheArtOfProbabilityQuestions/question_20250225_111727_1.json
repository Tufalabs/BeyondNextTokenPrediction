    "question": "Consider the scenario of rolling two fair six-sided dice. If we denote the outcome of the first die as \\(X_1\\) and the second die as \\(X_2\\), what is the probability of rolling a sum of 7? Use the convolution of the generating function to find the answer.",
    "solution": "To find the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice, we first note the possible combinations that yield this sum: \n\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 4)\n- (4, 3)\n- (5, 2)\n- (6, 1)\n\nThere are 6 favorable outcomes. Since there are a total of \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) possible outcomes when rolling two dice, the probability \\(P\\) of rolling a sum of 7 is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}.\n\\]",
