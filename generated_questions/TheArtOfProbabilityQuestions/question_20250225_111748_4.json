    "question": "If there are 5 white balls and 4 black balls in an urn, what is the probability that when drawing all the balls, they will be alternating in color?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing 5 white balls and 4 black balls in an alternating color pattern, we first note that the only possible alternating patterns must start and end with a white ball, since there are more white balls than black balls.\n\nThe valid pattern is: W B W B W B W B W.\n\nTo calculate the total number of arrangements of these balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = \\frac{9!}{5!4!}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange them in the alternating pattern. Since the pattern is fixed (W B W B W B W B W), there is only 1 way to arrange them in this specific order.\n\nThus, the probability \\(P\\) is given by:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{\\frac{9!}{5!4!}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(9!\\), \\(5!\\), and \\(4!\\):\n\\[\n9! = 362880, \\quad 5! = 120, \\quad 4! = 24\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9!}{5!4!} = \\frac{362880}{120 \\times 24} = \\frac{362880}{2880} = 126\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{126}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{126}}\n\\]",
