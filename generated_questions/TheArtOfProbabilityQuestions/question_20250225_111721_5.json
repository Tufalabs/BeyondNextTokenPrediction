    "question": "In a subjective probability assessment, if a person believes the probability of an event occurring is 70%, what is the probability of the event not occurring?",
    "solution": "The probability of an event not occurring can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability of not occurring} = 1 - \\text{Probability of occurring}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the probability of the event occurring is 70% (or 0.7), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability of not occurring} = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of the event not occurring is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.3}\n\\]",
