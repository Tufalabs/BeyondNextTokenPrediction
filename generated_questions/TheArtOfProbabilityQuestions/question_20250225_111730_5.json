    "question": "If you have a collection of 8 distinct colors and you want to select 3 colors to paint a picture, how many different permutations of these colors can you create?",
    "solution": "To find the number of permutations of 3 colors selected from 8 distinct colors, we use the permutation formula:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \\ldots (n - k + 1)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\). Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nP(8, 3) = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\)\n2. \\( 56 \\times 6 = 336 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of different permutations is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{336}\n\\]",
