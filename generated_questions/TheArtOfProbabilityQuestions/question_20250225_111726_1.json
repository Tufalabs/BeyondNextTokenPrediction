    "question": "Consider the Skolem-L\u00f6wenheim paradox, which states that any finite number of postulates has a realization that is countable. If we assume that the number of postulates in the real number system is finite and denote this number as \\( n \\), what can we conclude about the cardinality of the set of real numbers based on this paradox? Specifically, if \\( n = 5 \\), what is the cardinality of the set of real numbers?",
    "solution": "According to the Skolem-L\u00f6wenheim paradox, if the number of postulates \\( n \\) is finite, then the set of real numbers cannot be uniquely characterized and must be countable. Therefore, regardless of the specific value of \\( n \\), the conclusion is that the set of real numbers is uncountable. \n\nThus, even if \\( n = 5 \\), the cardinality of the set of real numbers remains uncountable. \n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Uncountable}\n\\]",
