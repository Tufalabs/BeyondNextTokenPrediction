    "question": "In the state diagram for the coin toss problem, if the transition from state S2 (H, head) to state S3 (HH, two heads in a row) has a probability of 0.5, what is the expected number of tosses required to go from S2 to S3?",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of tosses required to go from state S2 to state S3, we can set up the following equation:\n\nLet \\( E_2 \\) be the expected number of tosses starting from S2. The possible transitions from S2 are:\n- With probability 0.5, we go to S3 (HH) and stop.\n- With probability 0.5, we go back to S1 (T, tail) and need to start over.\n\nThus, we can write:\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 0.5 \\cdot 0 + 0.5E_1\n\\]\nWhere \\( E_1 \\) is the expected number of tosses from S1, which we previously calculated as 6.\n\nSubstituting \\( E_1 \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 0.5 \\cdot 6\n\\]\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of tosses required to go from S2 to S3 is \n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
