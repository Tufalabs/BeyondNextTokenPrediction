    "question": "If you were to randomly select a drawer and then a coin from that drawer, what is the probability of drawing a silver coin from the entire sample space before any observations are made?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing a silver coin from the entire sample space, we first need to consider the possible outcomes from each drawer:\n\n1. Drawer 1 (GG): Contains two gold coins (G1, G2).\n2. Drawer 2 (GS): Contains one gold coin (G) and one silver coin (S).\n3. Drawer 3 (SS): Contains two silver coins (S1, S2).\n\nThe total number of outcomes when selecting a drawer and then a coin is:\n\n- From Drawer 1: 0 outcomes (no silver coins).\n- From Drawer 2: 1 outcome (S).\n- From Drawer 3: 2 outcomes (S1, S2).\n\nThus, the total number of outcomes that yield a silver coin is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total silver outcomes} = 0 \\text{ (from Drawer 1)} + 1 \\text{ (from Drawer 2)} + 2 \\text{ (from Drawer 3)} = 3\n\\]\n\nThe total number of outcomes from all drawers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 2 \\text{ (from Drawer 1)} + 2 \\text{ (from Drawer 2)} + 2 \\text{ (from Drawer 3)} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability of drawing a silver coin from the entire sample space is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Silver coin}) = \\frac{\\text{Total silver outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of drawing a silver coin from the entire sample space is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]",
