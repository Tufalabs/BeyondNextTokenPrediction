    "question": "In a thought experiment involving an ideal ball dropped down a chute, the ball bounces to one side or the other depending on the position of a knife edge. If the knife edge is positioned exactly at the center of the chute, what is the probability that the ball will fall to the left side? Assume that the distribution of outcomes is uniform.",
    "solution": "In this scenario, since the knife edge is positioned at the center of the chute, the outcomes of the ball falling to the left or right are equally likely. Therefore, the probability of the ball falling to the left side is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{left}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the ball will fall to the left side is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5}\n\\]",
