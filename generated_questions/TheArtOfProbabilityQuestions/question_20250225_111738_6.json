    "question": "In a scenario where the host reveals a curtain that does not have the prize with a probability \\( p = 1 \\), what is the probability \\( P \\) of winning if you initially chose curtain B?",
    "solution": "Using the formula:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{1 + 2p}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( p = 1 \\):\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{1 + 2(1)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nThus, the probability of winning when \\( p = 1 \\) and you initially chose curtain B is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
