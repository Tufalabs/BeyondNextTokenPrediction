    "question": "If the generating function G(t) is expressed as G(t) = N(t) / D(t), and we know that D(t) = 1 - t/2 - t^2/4 - t^3/8, calculate D(1).",
    "solution": "Substituting t = 1 into D(t):\n\nD(1) = 1 - (1/2) - (1^2/4) - (1^3/8)\n= 1 - 0.5 - 0.25 - 0.125\n= 1 - 0.875\n= 0.125.\n\nThus, the value of D(1) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.125}.\n\\]",
