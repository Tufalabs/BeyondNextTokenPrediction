    "question": "In the third method of Bertrand's Paradox, if the midpoint of the chord is uniformly spread around the inside of the circle, what is the probability that the chord is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle?",
    "solution": "Using the third method described in Bertrand's Paradox, the probability that the chord is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle is given as:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]",
