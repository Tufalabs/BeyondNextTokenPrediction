    "question": "If a certain probability model indicates that the chance of success is 0.4, what is the probability of failure? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "The probability of failure can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Failure}) = 1 - P(\\text{Success})\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( P(\\text{Success}) = 0.4 \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Failure}) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of failure is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.60}\n\\]",
