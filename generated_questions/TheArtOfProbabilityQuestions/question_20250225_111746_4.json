    "question": "Consider a square lattice of points with size \\( n \\) where \\( n > 2 \\). What is the probability of picking a corner point from this lattice? Additionally, what is the probability of picking an inner point?",
    "solution": "In a square lattice of size \\( n \\), there are \\( n^2 \\) total points. The corner points are located at the four corners of the square. Therefore, the probability of picking a corner point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\text{corner point}) = \\frac{4}{n^2}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of picking an inner point, we first calculate the number of inner points. The inner points are those that are not on the edge, which can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total inner points} = (n - 2)^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of picking an inner point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\text{inner point}) = \\frac{(n - 2)^2}{n^2}\n\\]\n\nFinal answers:\n- Probability of picking a corner point: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{4}{n^2}}\\)\n- Probability of picking an inner point: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{(n - 2)^2}{n^2}}\\)",
