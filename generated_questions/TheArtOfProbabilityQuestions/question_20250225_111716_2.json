    "question": "In the context of Herschel's derivation, if the probability of the dart falling in the strip from \\( x \\) to \\( x + \\Delta x \\) is given by \\( p(x) \\Delta x \\) and the probability of falling in the strip from \\( y \\) to \\( y + \\Delta y \\) is \\( p(y) \\Delta y \\), what is the expression for the probability of falling in the shaded rectangle defined by these strips?",
    "solution": "The probability of the dart falling in the shaded rectangle, given the independence of the coordinate errors, is the product of the probabilities of falling in each strip. Therefore, we can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = p(x) \\Delta x \\cdot p(y) \\Delta y = p(x) p(y) \\Delta x \\Delta y\n\\]\n\nThus, the final expression for the probability of falling in the shaded rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p(x) p(y) \\Delta x \\Delta y}\n\\]",
