    "question": "In the context of rolling four dice, what is the probability of the sum being less than or equal to 7? If there are 35 outcomes that yield a sum of 7 or less, what is the probability?",
    "solution": "The total number of outcomes when rolling four dice is \\(6^4 = 1296\\). \n\nGiven that there are 35 outcomes that yield a sum of 7 or less, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} \\leq 7) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{35}{1296}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{35}{1296}}.\n\\]",
