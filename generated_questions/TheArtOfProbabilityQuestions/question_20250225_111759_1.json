    "question": "In a certain range of numbers, there are 30 numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, or 5. If the total number of numbers in this range is represented by \\(N - M\\), and the sum of the divisors is given as \\(15 + 10 + 6 - 5 - 3 - 2 + 1\\), calculate the value of \\(N - M\\).",
    "solution": "To find \\(N - M\\), we first need to calculate the sum of the divisors:\n\n\\[\n15 + 10 + 6 - 5 - 3 - 2 + 1 = 22\n\\]\n\nGiven that there are 30 numbers in the range, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n30 = N - M\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(N - M\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",
