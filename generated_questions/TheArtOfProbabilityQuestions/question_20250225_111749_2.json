    "question": "What is the expected value of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of cards, assuming that drawing an ace is worth 1 point and drawing any other card is worth 0 points?",
    "solution": "To calculate the expected value (E) of drawing two aces in a row, we first need to determine the expected value for one draw. The expected value for one draw can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE(\\text{one draw}) = (1 \\times P(\\text{Ace})) + (0 \\times P(\\text{Not Ace}))\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P(\\text{Ace}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\)\n- \\(P(\\text{Not Ace}) = \\frac{48}{52} = \\frac{12}{13}\\)\n\nThus, the expected value for one draw is:\n\n\\[\nE(\\text{one draw}) = (1 \\times \\frac{1}{13}) + (0 \\times \\frac{12}{13}) = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\nSince we are drawing two cards, the expected value for two draws is:\n\n\\[\nE(\\text{two draws}) = E(\\text{one draw}) + E(\\text{one draw}) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{2}{13}\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{13} \\approx 0.1538\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.1538}\n\\]",
