    "question": "In the context of the Riemann integral, if we have a function \\( f(x) \\) that is defined over the interval \\( (a, b) \\) and has a finite number of discontinuities, how does the presence of \\( k \\) discontinuities affect the value of the integral \\( \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\)? If \\( k = 3 \\), what can we conclude about the integral?",
    "solution": "The Riemann integral states that the value of the integral \\( \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\) is not affected by a finite number of discontinuities, provided that the function is reasonable (i.e., bounded and defined almost everywhere). Therefore, even if there are \\( k = 3 \\) discontinuities in the function \\( f(x) \\), the integral remains the same as if those points were not present.\n\nThus, we can conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\text{ is unaffected by } k = 3 \\text{ discontinuities.}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{The integral remains the same.}\n\\]",
