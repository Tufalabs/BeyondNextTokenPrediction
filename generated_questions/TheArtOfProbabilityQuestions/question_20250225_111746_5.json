    "question": "In a set of 100 chips, 10 are red. What is the probability of picking a red chip at random? Additionally, what is the probability of picking a chip that is not red?",
    "solution": "The probability of picking a red chip is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\text{red chip}) = \\frac{10}{100} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of picking a chip that is not red, we can subtract the probability of picking a red chip from 1:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\text{not red}) = 1 - \\text{Prob}(\\text{red chip}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{9}{10}\n\\]\n\nFinal answers:\n- Probability of picking a red chip: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}\\)\n- Probability of picking a chip that is not red: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}\\)",
