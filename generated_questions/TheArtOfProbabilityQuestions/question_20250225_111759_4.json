    "question": "A product goes through three stages of manufacture with yields of 80%, 90%, and 95% respectively. What is the final yield of the product after all three stages?",
    "solution": "To find the final yield, we multiply the yields of each stage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Yield} = 0.80 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.95\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 0.90 = 0.72\n\\]\n\\[\n0.72 \\times 0.95 = 0.684\n\\]\n\nThus, the final yield of the product is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.684} \\text{ or } 68.4\\%\n\\]",
