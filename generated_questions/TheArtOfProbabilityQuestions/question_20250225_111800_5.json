    "question": "In a continuous probability distribution scenario, if the rate of a certain event occurring is 5 events per hour, what is the expected number of events in a 3-hour period?",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of events in a given time period, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nE = \\text{rate} \\cdot \\text{time}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the rate is 5 events per hour and the time period is 3 hours:\n\n\\[\nE = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of events in a 3-hour period is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
