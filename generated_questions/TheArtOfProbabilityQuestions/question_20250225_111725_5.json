    "question": "In a game, a player rolls two dice. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is greater than 8?",
    "solution": "To find the probability that the sum of two dice is greater than 8, we first determine the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice, which is:\n\\[ \n6 \\times 6 = 36 \n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the combinations of the two dice that yield a sum greater than 8. The possible sums greater than 8 are 9, 10, 11, and 12. We can list the combinations for each:\n\n- Sum of 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \u2192 4 combinations\n- Sum of 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) \u2192 3 combinations\n- Sum of 11: (5,6), (6,5) \u2192 2 combinations\n- Sum of 12: (6,6) \u2192 1 combination\n\nAdding these combinations gives:\n\\[ \n4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 \n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of the sum being greater than 8 is:\n\\[ \nP(\\text{sum} > 8) = \\frac{10}{36} = \\frac{5}{18} \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the two dice is greater than 8 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}\n\\]",
