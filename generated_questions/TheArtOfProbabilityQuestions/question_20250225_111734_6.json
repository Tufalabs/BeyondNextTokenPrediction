    "question": "In the context of the flat distribution, if the distance for 3 factors is 0.0980, what is the ratio of this distance to the distance for 1 factor?",
    "solution": "The distance for 3 factors is given as 0.0980, and the distance for 1 factor is 1.558. To find the ratio of the distance for 3 factors to the distance for 1 factor, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Distance for 3 factors}}{\\text{Distance for 1 factor}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.0980}{1.558} \\approx 0.0629\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the distance for 3 factors to the distance for 1 factor is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0629}\n\\]",
