    "question": "If the host randomly reveals a curtain that does not have the prize behind it, what is the new probability that the prize is behind the curtain you initially chose if you picked curtain A?",
    "solution": "When the host reveals a curtain randomly, the probability that the prize is behind curtain A remains 1/3. The probability that the prize is behind either curtain B or C is now 2/3. Therefore, if you initially chose curtain A, the probability that the prize is behind it after the host reveals a non-prize curtain is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
