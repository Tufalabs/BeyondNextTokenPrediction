    "question": "If the probabilities of two items in a distribution are \\( p(i) = 0.4 \\) and \\( p(j) = 0.6 \\), calculate the entropy \\( H \\) of the combined distribution \\( p(i) + p(j) \\).",
    "solution": "The combined probability is:\n\n\\[\np(i) + p(j) = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1\n\\]\n\nThe entropy \\( H \\) of a distribution is given by:\n\n\\[\nH = -\\sum p(k) \\log p(k)\n\\]\n\nFor the combined distribution, since \\( p(i) + p(j) = 1 \\), we can calculate the entropy as follows:\n\n\\[\nH = -[p(i) \\log p(i) + p(j) \\log p(j)]\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\nH = -[0.4 \\log(0.4) + 0.6 \\log(0.6)]\n\\]\n\nUsing natural logarithms:\n\n\\[\nH \\approx -[0.4 \\times (-0.9163) + 0.6 \\times (-0.5108)] \\approx 0.4 \\times 0.9163 + 0.6 \\times 0.5108 \\approx 0.3665 + 0.3065 = 0.673\n\\]\n\nThus, the entropy of the combined distribution is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.673}\n\\]",
