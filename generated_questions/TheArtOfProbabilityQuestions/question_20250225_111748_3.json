    "question": "In a scenario where you have 2n discs, what is the probability that all the even-numbered discs are drawn before the odd-numbered discs?",
    "solution": "To find the probability that all even-numbered discs are drawn before all odd-numbered discs when there are \\(2n\\) discs, we can use the formula provided in the text.\n\nThe probability \\(P\\) is given by:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{(n!)^2}{(2n)!}\n\\]\n\nThis formula arises because we can arrange \\(n\\) even-numbered discs and \\(n\\) odd-numbered discs in any order, but we want all even-numbered discs to come before the odd-numbered ones.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{(n!)^2}{(2n)!}}\n\\]",
