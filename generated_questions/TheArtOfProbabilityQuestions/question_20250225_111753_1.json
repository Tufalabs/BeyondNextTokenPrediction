    "question": "A ball is dropped from a height of 2 meters. Assuming no air resistance and using the acceleration due to gravity as \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\), calculate the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground. Use the formula \\(d = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\), where \\(d\\) is the distance fallen, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(t\\) is the time in seconds.",
    "solution": "To find the time \\(t\\), we can rearrange the formula \\(d = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) to solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\implies t^2 = \\frac{2d}{g} \\implies t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2d}{g}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values \\(d = 2 \\, \\text{m}\\) and \\(g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\):\n\n\\[\nt = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 2}{9.81}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{9.81}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.4077} \\approx 0.638 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nThus, the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground is approximately \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.64} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]",
