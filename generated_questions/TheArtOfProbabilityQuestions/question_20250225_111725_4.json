    "question": "If a box contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, what is the probability of drawing 2 red balls without replacement?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing 2 red balls without replacement from a box containing 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, we can use the formula for conditional probability.\n\nThe total number of balls is:\n\\[ \n5 + 3 = 8 \n\\]\n\nThe probability of drawing the first red ball is:\n\\[ \nP(\\text{1st red}) = \\frac{5}{8} \n\\]\n\nAfter drawing one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left and a total of 7 balls remaining. The probability of drawing a second red ball is:\n\\[ \nP(\\text{2nd red | 1st red}) = \\frac{4}{7} \n\\]\n\nThus, the combined probability of both events occurring is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red | 1st red}) = \\frac{5}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{20}{56} = \\frac{5}{14}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 2 red balls without replacement is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{14}}\n\\]",
