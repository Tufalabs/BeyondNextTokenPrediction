    "question": "If the variance of the sum of three independent random numbers drawn from a distribution is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), what is the variance of each individual random number if they are drawn from a distribution with variance \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\)?",
    "solution": "The variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. Let \\( \\sigma^2 \\) be the variance of each individual random number. Then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Variance of sum} = 3 \\sigma^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that the variance of the sum is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n3 \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\sigma^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\div 3 = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, the variance of each individual random number is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}\n\\]",
