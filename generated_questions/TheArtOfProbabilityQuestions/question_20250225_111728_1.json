    "question": "In a simulation of call durations, the average length of a call is modeled using an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 minutes. If you simulate 10 calls, what is the expected total duration of these calls?",
    "solution": "The expected duration of a single call is given by the mean of the exponential distribution, which is 5 minutes. Therefore, for 10 calls, the expected total duration can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Duration} = \\text{Number of Calls} \\times \\text{Mean Duration} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected total duration of the 10 calls is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{50} \\text{ minutes}.\n\\]",
