    "question": "In the Two Gold Coins Problem, if you were to conduct an experiment with 6000 cards, how many cards would represent the scenario where a silver coin is drawn from Drawer 2 (which contains one gold and one silver coin)?",
    "solution": "In the Two Gold Coins Problem, Drawer 2 contains one gold coin (G) and one silver coin (S). The total number of initial choices is represented by 6000 cards, with each drawer and coin combination being equally likely.\n\nSince there are three drawers, the probability of choosing any one drawer is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). Each drawer has two possible outcomes for drawing a coin (for Drawer 2, the outcomes are G and S). Therefore, the total number of outcomes for Drawer 2 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes for Drawer 2} = 2 \\text{ (G, S)}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of outcomes across all drawers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 3 \\text{ drawers} \\times 2 \\text{ outcomes per drawer} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, the proportion of outcomes that correspond to Drawer 2 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Proportion for Drawer 2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of cards representing the scenario where a silver coin is drawn from Drawer 2, we need to consider that only one of the two outcomes from Drawer 2 is a silver coin (S). Therefore, the proportion of outcomes that yield a silver coin from Drawer 2 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Proportion for silver from Drawer 2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total proportion of cards representing the scenario where a silver coin is drawn from Drawer 2 is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total proportion for Drawer 2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the total number of cards by this proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cards for silver from Drawer 2} = 6000 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of cards representing the scenario where a silver coin is drawn from Drawer 2 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",
