    "question": "In the context of the Buffon needle problem, if a needle of length \\( L \\) is dropped onto a floor with parallel lines spaced \\( d \\) apart, what is the probability that the needle will cross a line if \\( L < d \\)?",
    "solution": "The probability \\( P \\) that the needle crosses a line can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2L}{\\pi d}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( L < d \\), we can substitute specific values for \\( L \\) and \\( d \\) to find the probability. For example, if \\( L = 1 \\) and \\( d = 2 \\):\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{\\pi \\times 2} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\approx 0.3183\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer for the probability that the needle will cross a line is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\pi}} \\text{ or approximately } 0.3183\n\\]",
