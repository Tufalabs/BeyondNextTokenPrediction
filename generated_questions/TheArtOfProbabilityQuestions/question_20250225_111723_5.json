    "question": "In the simulation, for 1200 trials, the number of heads was recorded as 619. Calculate the expected number of heads and the actual deviation from this expected number.",
    "solution": "First, we calculate the expected number of heads (E) for 1200 trials:\n\n\\[\nE = \\text{Total Trials} \\times \\text{Probability of Heads} = 1200 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 600\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the deviation (D) from the expected number of heads:\n\n\\[\nD = \\text{Actual Heads} - \\text{Expected Heads} = 619 - 600 = 19\n\\]\n\nThus, the deviation from the expected number of heads is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]",
