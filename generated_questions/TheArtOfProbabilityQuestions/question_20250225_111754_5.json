    "solution": "To find the expected value of the product of three independently thrown dice, we first find the expected value of a single die:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\n\\]\n\nThe expected value of the product of three independent random variables \\( X_1, X_2, X_3 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nE(X_1 \\cdot X_2 \\cdot X_3) = E(X_1) \\cdot E(X_2) \\cdot E(X_3)\n\\]\n\nSince all three dice are identical:\n\n\\[\nE(X_1 \\cdot X_2 \\cdot X_3) = E(X)^3 = (3.5)^3\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (3.5)^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n(3.5)^3 = 42.875\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected value of the product of three independently thrown dice is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{42.875}\n\\]",
