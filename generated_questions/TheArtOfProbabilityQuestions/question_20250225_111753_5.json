    "question": "In a game, a player rolls a die and wins if they roll a number greater than 4. What is the probability of winning this game?",
    "solution": "To determine the probability of winning by rolling a number greater than 4, we first identify the favorable outcomes. The numbers greater than 4 on a standard six-sided die are 5 and 6.\n\nThus, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 (rolling a 5 or a 6). The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6. Therefore, the probability \\(P\\) of winning is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of winning the game is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.\n\\]",
