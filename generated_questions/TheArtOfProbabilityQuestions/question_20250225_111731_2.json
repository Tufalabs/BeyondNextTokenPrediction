    "question": "In a random number generation program, a sequence of 1,000 pseudo-random numbers is generated, and it is found that 300 of them are odd integers. What is the empirical probability of generating an odd integer in this sequence?",
    "solution": "The empirical probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of trials. In this case, the number of odd integers generated is 300, and the total number of generated numbers is 1,000.\n\nThus, the empirical probability \\( P \\) of generating an odd integer is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{odd integer}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of odd integers}}{\\text{Total numbers}} = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the empirical probability of generating an odd integer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.3}\n\\]",
