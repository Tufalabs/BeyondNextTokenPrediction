    "question": "In the state diagram for the coin toss problem, if the transition probability from state S1 (T, tail) to state S2 (H, head) is 0.5, and the transition probability from S2 to S3 (HH, two heads in a row) is also 0.5, what is the expected number of tosses required to reach state S3 starting from state S1, considering the transition probabilities?",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of tosses required to reach state S3 starting from state S1, we can set up the following equations based on the expected values:\n\nLet \\( E_1 \\) be the expected number of tosses starting from S1, \\( E_2 \\) be the expected number of tosses starting from S2, and \\( E_3 = 0 \\) since reaching S3 means we stop.\n\nFrom state S1:\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5E_2\n\\]\n\nFrom state S2:\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5E_3\n\\]\nSince \\( E_3 = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\nE_2 = 1 + 0.5E_1\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( E_2 \\) into the equation for \\( E_1 \\):\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5(1 + 0.5E_1)\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 + 0.5E_1 + 0.5 + 0.25E_1\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = 1.5 + 0.75E_1\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 - 0.75E_1 = 1.5\n\\]\n\\[\n0.25E_1 = 1.5\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = \\frac{1.5}{0.25} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of tosses required to reach state S3 starting from state S1 is \n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
