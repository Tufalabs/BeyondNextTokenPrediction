    "solution": "Using the recursive formula, we previously calculated:\n\n\\[\nP(3) = \\frac{2}{9}\n\\]\n\nNow, according to the table provided in the text, the true value for \\(n = 3\\) is:\n\n\\[\nP(3) \\approx 0.2222\n\\]\n\nTo compare:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.2222\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability P(3) calculated using the recursive formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{9}}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the true value provided in the table, confirming the accuracy of our calculation.",
