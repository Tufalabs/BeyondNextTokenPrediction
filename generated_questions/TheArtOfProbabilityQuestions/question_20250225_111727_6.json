    "solution": "To find out how much the model exceeds the threshold for being considered fruitful, we subtract the threshold from the number of new ideas suggested by the model:\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ (new ideas)} - 10 \\text{ (threshold)} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the model exceeds the threshold for being considered fruitful by \\( \\boxed{5} \\) new ideas.",
