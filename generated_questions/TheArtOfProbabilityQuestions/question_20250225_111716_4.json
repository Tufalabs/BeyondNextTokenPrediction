    "solution": "In polar coordinates, the distance \\( r \\) from the origin to the point where the dart falls is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( r^2 \\), we simply square both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the final expression for \\( r^2 \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]",
