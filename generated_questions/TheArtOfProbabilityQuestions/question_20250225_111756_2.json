    "question": "If a die is rolled 60 times, what is the expected number of times a 3 will appear?",
    "solution": "The probability \\( p \\) of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). The expected number of times a 3 will appear in 60 rolls is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE = n \\cdot p = 60 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of times a 3 will appear is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
