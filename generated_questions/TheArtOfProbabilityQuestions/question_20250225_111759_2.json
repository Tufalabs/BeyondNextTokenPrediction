    "solution": "The probability of selecting a number that is divisible by 2, 3, or 5 is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{divisible}) = \\frac{22}{30}\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of selecting a number that is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we subtract the probability of being divisible from 1:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{not divisible}) = 1 - P(\\text{divisible}) = 1 - \\frac{22}{30} = \\frac{30 - 22}{30} = \\frac{8}{30} = \\frac{4}{15}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of not being divisible is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{15}}\n\\]",
