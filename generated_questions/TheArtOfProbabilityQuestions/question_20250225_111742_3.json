    "question": "Assuming the ball is launched with an initial speed of 2 meters per second and experiences a frictional deceleration of 0.1 meters per second squared, how long will it take for the ball to come to a complete stop?",
    "solution": "To find the time it takes for the ball to come to a complete stop, we can use the formula for acceleration:\n\nFinal velocity = Initial velocity + (acceleration \u00d7 time).\n\nSince the ball comes to a stop, the final velocity is 0 m/s. The initial velocity is 2 m/s, and the acceleration (deceleration in this case) is -0.1 m/s\u00b2.\n\n0 = 2 + (-0.1) \u00d7 time.\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n\n0.1 \u00d7 time = 2.\n\nNow, we solve for time:\n\ntime = 2 / 0.1 = 20 seconds.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
