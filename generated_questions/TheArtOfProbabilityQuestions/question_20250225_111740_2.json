    "solution": "The canonical partition (2, 4, 6) consists of three distinct integers. The number of equivalent arrangements of three distinct integers is given by \\( 3! \\).\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n3! = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of equivalent ways to arrange the partition (2, 4, 6) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
