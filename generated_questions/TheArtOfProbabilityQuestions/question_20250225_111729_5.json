    "question": "In the context of the birthday problem, if you want to find the probability of at least one duplicate in 23 trials, what is the probability of at least one duplicate given that the probability of no duplicates is approximately 0.4927?",
    "solution": "The probability of at least one duplicate can be found using the complement of the probability of no duplicates. If the probability of no duplicates in 23 trials is approximately 0.4927, then the probability of at least one duplicate is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one duplicate}) = 1 - P(\\text{no duplicates})\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one duplicate}) = 1 - 0.4927 \\approx 0.5073\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of at least one duplicate in 23 trials is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5073}\n\\]",
