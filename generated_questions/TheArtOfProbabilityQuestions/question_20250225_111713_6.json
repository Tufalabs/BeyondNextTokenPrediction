    "solution": "To find the range of the simulations, we need to determine the maximum value. The range is calculated as:\n\nRange = Maximum value - Minimum value\n\nAssuming the maximum value is the highest recorded simulation, which is 23.59, we calculate:\n\nRange = 23.59 - 20.07 = 3.52\n\nThus, the range of the simulations is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.52}\n\\]",
