    "question": "In a product space involving the roll of three dice, each die has 6 faces. What is the size of the product space for rolling three dice?",
    "solution": "To determine the size of the product space when rolling three dice, we calculate the total outcomes as follows:\n\nTotal outcomes = \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 6^3 = 216\\).\n\nThus, the size of the product space for rolling three dice is \\(\\boxed{216}\\).",
