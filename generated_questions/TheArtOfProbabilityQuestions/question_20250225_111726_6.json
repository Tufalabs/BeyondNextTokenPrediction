    "question": "If a single card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a red card? Calculate the probability based on the number of favorable outcomes.",
    "solution": "In a standard deck of cards, there are 26 red cards (13 hearts and 13 diamonds). The probability of drawing a red card is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{red card}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of red cards}}{\\text{Total number of cards}} = \\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of drawing a red card is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",
