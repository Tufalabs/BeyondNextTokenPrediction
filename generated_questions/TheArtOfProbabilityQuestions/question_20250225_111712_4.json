    "question": "If you consider a line segment of finite length and toss a coin of unit radius onto the floor, what is the distance from the line within which the center of the coin must fall for the chord formed to be longer than the corresponding triangle?",
    "solution": "According to the description in the text, the center of the coin must fall within a distance of:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nfrom the line for the chord to be longer than the corresponding triangle. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]",
