    "question": "If a sequence of coin tosses is said to be \"certified random\" when it allows for big fluctuations late in the sequence, and if the first 1000 tosses are all heads, how many tosses are left in a total of 2000 tosses?",
    "solution": "If the total number of tosses is 2000 and the first 1000 tosses are all heads, the number of tosses left can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tosses left} = \\text{Total tosses} - \\text{Tosses already made} = 2000 - 1000\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tosses left} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of tosses left in the sequence is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",
