    "question": "In a simulation, you are rolling a fair six-sided die 30 times. What is the expected number of times you would roll a 4?",
    "solution": "The expected value \\( E \\) for a single event can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nE = n \\cdot p\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of trials and \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial. \n\nIn this case:\n- \\( n = 30 \\) (the number of rolls),\n- \\( p = \\frac{1}{6} \\) (the probability of rolling a 4).\n\nNow substituting the values:\n\n\\[\nE = 30 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of times you would roll a 4 in 30 rolls of a fair die is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}.\n\\]",
