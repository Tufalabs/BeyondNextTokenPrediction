    "question": "In a game where a player has won 15 out of 20 games played, what is the estimated probability \\(p\\) of the player winning a single trial?",
    "solution": "To estimate the probability \\(p\\) of the player winning a single trial, we can use the ratio of the number of games won to the total number of games played.\n\nThe player has won 15 games out of 20. Therefore, the estimated probability \\(p\\) is given by:\n\\[\np = \\frac{\\text{Number of games won}}{\\text{Total number of games played}} = \\frac{15}{20}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\\[\np = \\frac{15 \\div 5}{20 \\div 5} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\n\\]",
