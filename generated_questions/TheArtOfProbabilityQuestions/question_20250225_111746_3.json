    "question": "If there are 26 chips each labeled with a different letter of the alphabet, what is the probability of choosing the chip labeled 'Q' when a chip is drawn at random? Furthermore, what is the probability of drawing a vowel (A, E, I, O, U)?",
    "solution": "The probability of choosing the chip labeled 'Q' is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\text{choosing Q}) = \\frac{1}{26}\n\\]\n\nNext, we count the number of vowels in the alphabet, which are A, E, I, O, U. There are 5 vowels. Therefore, the probability of drawing a vowel is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\text{vowel}) = \\frac{5}{26}\n\\]\n\nFinal answers:\n- Probability of choosing the chip labeled 'Q': \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{26}}\\)\n- Probability of drawing a vowel: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{26}}\\)",
