    "question": "If the classical real number system is said to have comparatively few paradoxes left, and we denote the number of known paradoxes as \\( p \\), with \\( p = 5 \\) at present, what is the implication for the reliability of the classical real number system in mathematical applications? Specifically, if the number of paradoxes doubles, what will be the new value of \\( p \\)?",
    "solution": "If the current number of known paradoxes in the classical real number system is \\( p = 5 \\), and it is stated that the number of paradoxes doubles, we can calculate the new value of \\( p \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\np_{\\text{new}} = 2 \\cdot p = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, if the number of paradoxes doubles, the new value of \\( p \\) will be:\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n10\n\\]",
