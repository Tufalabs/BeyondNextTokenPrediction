    "question": "In a scenario where you are drawing cards from a deck, if the expected value of drawing one ace is \\(\\frac{1}{13}\\), what is the expected value of drawing two aces in a row with replacement expressed as a fraction?",
    "solution": "As previously calculated, the expected value for one draw is:\n\n\\[\nE(\\text{one draw}) = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\nFor two draws, the expected value is simply the sum of the expected values of each draw:\n\n\\[\nE(\\text{two draws}) = E(\\text{one draw}) + E(\\text{one draw}) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{2}{13}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{13}}\n\\]",
