    "question": "If a die is rolled three times, what is the probability of getting a sum of 9? Assume the die is fair and has six faces.",
    "solution": "To find the probability of getting a sum of 9 when rolling a die three times, we first need to determine the total number of outcomes when rolling three dice. Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes is:\n\\[ \n6^3 = 216 \n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the combinations of the three dice that sum to 9. The possible combinations (x, y, z) where x, y, z are the results of the three dice can be calculated. The valid combinations that yield a sum of 9 are:\n1. (1, 2, 6)\n2. (1, 3, 5)\n3. (1, 4, 4)\n4. (2, 2, 5)\n5. (2, 3, 4)\n6. (3, 3, 3)\n\nCounting the permutations of these combinations:\n- (1, 2, 6) has 6 permutations.\n- (1, 3, 5) has 6 permutations.\n- (1, 4, 4) has 3 permutations.\n- (2, 2, 5) has 3 permutations.\n- (2, 3, 4) has 6 permutations.\n- (3, 3, 3) has 1 permutation.\n\nCalculating the total number of favorable outcomes:\n\\[ \n6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 25 \n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of getting a sum of 9 is:\n\\[ \nP(\\text{sum} = 9) = \\frac{25}{216} \n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 9 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{25}{216}}\n\\]",
