    "question": "If the face cards count as J = 11, Q = 12, and K = 13, what is the probability of drawing two random cards (with replacement) totaling more than 15? Assume a standard deck of 52 cards.",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing two cards that total more than 15, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two cards with replacement. \n\nThe total number of outcomes is \\(52 \\times 52 = 2704\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the combinations of card values that total more than 15. The possible values for the cards are 1 (Ace), 2, 3, ..., 10, 11 (Jack), 12 (Queen), and 13 (King). \n\nThe pairs that total more than 15 can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For a total of 16: (3, 13), (4, 12), (5, 11), (6, 10), (7, 9), (8, 8), (9, 7), (10, 6), (11, 5), (12, 4), (13, 3) \u2192 11 combinations.\n- For a total of 17: (4, 13), (5, 12), (6, 11), (7, 10), (8, 9), (9, 8), (10, 7), (11, 6), (12, 5), (13, 4) \u2192 10 combinations.\n- For a total of 18: (5, 13), (6, 12), (7, 11), (8, 10), (9, 9), (10, 8), (11, 7), (12, 6), (13, 5) \u2192 9 combinations.\n- For a total of 19: (6, 13), (7, 12), (8, 11), (9, 10), (10, 9), (11, 8), (12, 7), (13, 6) \u2192 8 combinations.\n- For a total of 20: (7, 13), (8, 12), (9, 11), (10, 10), (11, 9), (12, 8), (13, 7) \u2192 7 combinations.\n- For a total of 21: (8, 13), (9, 12), (10, 11), (11, 10), (12, 9), (13, 8) \u2192 6 combinations.\n- For a total of 22: (9, 13), (10, 12), (11, 11), (12, 10), (13, 9) \u2192 5 combinations.\n- For a total of 23: (10, 13), (11, 12), (12, 11), (13, 10) \u2192 4 combinations.\n- For a total of 24: (11, 13), (12, 12), (13, 11) \u2192 3 combinations.\n- For a total of 25: (12, 13), (13, 12) \u2192 2 combinations.\n- For a total of 26: (13, 13) \u2192 1 combination.\n\nAdding these combinations gives us:\n\n11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 66 combinations.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{total} > 15) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{66}{2704}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{66}{2704}}.\n\\]",
