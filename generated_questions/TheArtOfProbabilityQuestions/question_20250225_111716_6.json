    "question": "If a certain machine produces every fifth item defective, what is the probability that a randomly selected item is defective?",
    "solution": "The probability of selecting a defective item from this machine can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{defective}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of items produced before a defective one}} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected item is defective is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}.\n\\]",
