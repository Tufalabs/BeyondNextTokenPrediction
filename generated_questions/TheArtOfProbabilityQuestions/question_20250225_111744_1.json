    "question": "Suppose you are on the bank of a straight river and walk a kilometer in a randomly chosen direction. If the angle between your walking direction and the river is denoted as \\( z \\), what is the expected distance from the river after walking one kilometer? Use the integral provided in the example to calculate this expected distance.",
    "solution": "To find the expected distance from the river, we need to calculate the expectation of the variable \\( \\sin z \\) over the interval \\( [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}] \\). The probability density function for choosing an angle \\( z \\) is given by \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\).\n\nThe expected distance \\( E(\\sin z) \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE(\\sin z) = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sin z \\right) dz\n\\]\n\nCalculating the integral:\n\n\\[\nE(\\sin z) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left[ -\\cos z \\right]_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left( -\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(0) \\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} (0 + 1) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the value of \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n\n\\[\nE(\\sin z) \\approx \\frac{2}{3.14159} \\approx 0.6366\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected distance from the river is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.6366}\n\\]",
