    "question": "In a game where you choose one of three curtains (A, B, or C) and a host reveals a curtain that does not have a prize behind it, what is the probability that the prize is behind the curtain you initially chose if you picked curtain A? Assume the host knows where the prize is and will never reveal it.",
    "solution": "If you initially choose curtain A, the probability of the prize being behind A is 1/3. The host will reveal either curtain B or C, which does not have the prize. Therefore, the probability that the prize is behind either B or C is 2/3. Since the host will not reveal the prize, the probability that the prize is behind your initial choice (curtain A) remains 1/3. \n\nThus, the probability that the prize is behind curtain A is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
