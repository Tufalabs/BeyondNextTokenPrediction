    "solution": "According to the property of entropy for independent random variables, we have:\n\n\\[\nH(XY) = H(X) + H(Y)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\nH(XY) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the entropy of the product of the two independent random variables is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
