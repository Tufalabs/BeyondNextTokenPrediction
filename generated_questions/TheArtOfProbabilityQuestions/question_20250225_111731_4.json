    "question": "In a study of random sequences, a researcher notes that a certain random number generator produces numbers between 1 and 100. If the generator is used to produce 200 numbers, what is the expected number of times the number 50 will appear in this sequence, assuming each number has an equal chance of being generated?",
    "solution": "The expected number of times a specific number appears in a random sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nE = n \\times p\n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of trials (in this case, the total numbers generated) and \\( p \\) is the probability of generating the specific number.\n\nSince the generator produces numbers between 1 and 100, the probability \\( p \\) of generating the number 50 is:\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{100}\n\\]\n\nGiven that 200 numbers are generated, we can calculate the expected number of times the number 50 will appear:\n\\[\nE = 200 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of times the number 50 will appear in the sequence is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
