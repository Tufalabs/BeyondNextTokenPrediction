    "question": "If a random variable follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, what is the z-score for a value of 60?",
    "solution": "The z-score can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( X = 60 \\),\n- \\( \\mu = 50 \\),\n- \\( \\sigma = 5 \\).\n\nNow substituting the values:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(60 - 50)}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the z-score for a value of 60 is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}.\n\\]",
