    "question": "In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing two aces in a row with replacement? Calculate the probability as a fraction and then convert it to a decimal rounded to four decimal places.",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing two aces in a row with replacement, we first determine the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw. There are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing an ace is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Ace}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\nSince we are replacing the card, the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw remains the same:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Ace on second draw}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\nThe probability of both events occurring (drawing an ace on the first draw and drawing an ace on the second draw) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Two Aces}) = P(\\text{Ace}) \\times P(\\text{Ace}) = \\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{169}\n\\]\n\nNow, converting this fraction to a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{169} \\approx 0.0059\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0059}\n\\]",
