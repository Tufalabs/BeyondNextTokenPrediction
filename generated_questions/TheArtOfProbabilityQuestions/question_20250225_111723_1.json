    "question": "In a simulation of tossing a coin using a pseudo random number generator, the results of 2000 trials showed that the number of heads (H) was 1008. Given that the expected probability of getting heads in a fair coin toss is 1/2, calculate the deviation from the expected number of heads for these trials.",
    "solution": "To find the deviation from the expected number of heads, we first calculate the expected number of heads in 2000 trials. The expected number of heads (E) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nE = \\text{Total Trials} \\times \\text{Probability of Heads} = 2000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the deviation (D) from the expected number of heads:\n\n\\[\nD = \\text{Actual Heads} - \\text{Expected Heads} = 1008 - 1000 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the deviation from the expected number of heads is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
