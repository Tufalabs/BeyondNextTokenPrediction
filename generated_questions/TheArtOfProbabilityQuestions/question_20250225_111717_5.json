    "question": "In a simulation, you notice that the results vary due to sampling fluctuations. If you have a sample size of 50 and the standard deviation of the sample is 4, what is the standard error of the mean for this sample?",
    "solution": "The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated using the formula:\n\nSEM = \u03c3 / \u221an\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nSEM = 4 / \u221a50 \u2248 4 / 7.071 = 0.5657\n\nThus, the standard error of the mean for this sample is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5657}\n\\]",
