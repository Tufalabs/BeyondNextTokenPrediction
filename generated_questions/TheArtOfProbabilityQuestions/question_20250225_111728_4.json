    "question": "If a simulation shows that the average time between calls is 7 minutes, what is the expected number of calls in a 2-hour period?",
    "solution": "First, convert 2 hours into minutes:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the expected number of calls, we divide the total time by the average time between calls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Number of Calls} = \\frac{\\text{Total Time}}{\\text{Average Time Between Calls}} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{7 \\text{ minutes}} \\approx 17.14\n\\]\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a call, we round down to the nearest whole number. Thus, the expected number of calls in a 2-hour period is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}.\n\\]",
