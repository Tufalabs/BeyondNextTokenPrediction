    "question": "In a study of fuzzy sets introduced by L. Zadeh in 1965, it was observed that the concept of fuzzy probability allows for a range of probabilities rather than fixed values. If a fuzzy set is defined such that the probability of an event occurring is represented as a range from 0.3 to 0.7, what is the average probability of the event occurring?",
    "solution": "To find the average probability of the event occurring, we can calculate the mean of the lower and upper bounds of the fuzzy set.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Lower Bound} + \\text{Upper Bound}}{2} = \\frac{0.3 + 0.7}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the average probability of the event occurring is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5}\n\\]",
