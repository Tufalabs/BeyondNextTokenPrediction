    "question": "In a game of dice, if a player rolls two standard six-sided dice, what is the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is equal to 7?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice, we first determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice, which is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\nNext, we identify the combinations that result in a sum of 7:\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 4)\n- (4, 3)\n- (5, 2)\n- (6, 1)\n\nThere are 6 combinations that yield a sum of 7. Therefore, the probability \\(P\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is equal to 7 is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}.\n\\]",
