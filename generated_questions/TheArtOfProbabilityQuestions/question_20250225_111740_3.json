    "question": "If we consider the sum \\( k = 8 \\) when rolling three six-sided dice, how many total canonical partitions are there for this value of \\( k \\) according to the table?",
    "solution": "From the table, the canonical partitions for \\( k = 8 \\) are:\n- (1, 1, 6)\n- (1, 2, 5)\n- (1, 3, 4)\n- (2, 2, 4)\n- (2, 3, 3)\n\nCounting these, we find there are 5 canonical partitions.\n\nThus, the total number of canonical partitions for \\( k = 8 \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
