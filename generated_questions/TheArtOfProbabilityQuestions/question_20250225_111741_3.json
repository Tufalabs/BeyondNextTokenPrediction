    "question": "In the context of the normal distribution, the tails are negligible at 4u and infinitesimal at 6u. If we consider a standard deviation of 1, what is the range of values that can be considered negligible for the normal distribution?",
    "solution": "In a normal distribution, the tails are considered negligible at 4 standard deviations (4u) from the mean. Given that the standard deviation is 1, the range of values that can be considered negligible is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} \\pm 4 \\times \\text{Standard Deviation} = 0 \\pm 4 \\times 1 = [-4, 4]\n\\]\n\nThus, the range of values that can be considered negligible for the normal distribution is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[-4, 4]}\n\\]",
