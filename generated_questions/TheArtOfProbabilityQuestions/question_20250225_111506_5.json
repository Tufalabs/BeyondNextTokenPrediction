    "question": "If the host always reveals a curtain that does not have the prize (i.e., \\( p = 0 \\)), what is the probability of winning if you initially chose curtain A?",
    "solution": "If \\( p = 0 \\), it means the host must reveal the curtain with the prize if possible. Since the host did not reveal the prize, it implies that the prize must be behind one of the other curtains. Therefore, the probability of winning if you initially chose curtain A is:\n\n\\[\nP = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
