    "question": "For the 800 trials, the number of heads was recorded as 434. Calculate the ratio of heads to total trials and express it as a fraction in simplest form.",
    "solution": "To find the ratio of heads to total trials, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Heads}}{\\text{Total Trials}} = \\frac{434}{800}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 434 and 800. The GCD is 2.\n\nNow, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Simplified Ratio} = \\frac{434 \\div 2}{800 \\div 2} = \\frac{217}{400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of heads to total trials in simplest form is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{217}{400}}\n\\]",
