    "question": "In a simulation, if the average call duration is 6 minutes and the average time between calls is 8 minutes, what is the expected proportion of time spent on calls during a 1-hour simulation?",
    "solution": "First, calculate the expected number of calls in 1 hour (60 minutes):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Number of Calls} = \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{8 \\text{ minutes}} = 7.5 \\text{ calls}\n\\]\n\nSince we cannot have half a call, we can consider 7 calls for practical purposes. Now, calculate the total time spent on calls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time on Calls} = \\text{Number of Calls} \\times \\text{Average Call Duration} = 7 \\times 6 \\text{ minutes} = 42 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the proportion of time spent on calls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Proportion of Time on Calls} = \\frac{\\text{Total Time on Calls}}{\\text{Total Simulation Time}} = \\frac{42 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.7\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected proportion of time spent on calls during a 1-hour simulation is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.7}.\n\\]",
