    "question": "If the variance of the sum of two independent random variables is 76, what is the variance of a single random variable?",
    "solution": "The variance of the sum of two independent random variables is the sum of their variances. If the variance of the sum is given as 76, we can denote the variance of a single random variable as \\(Var(X)\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nVar(X_1 + X_2) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) = Var(X) + Var(X) = 2Var(X)\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 76 gives:\n\n\\[\n2Var(X) = 76 \\implies Var(X) = \\frac{76}{2} = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the variance of a single random variable is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
