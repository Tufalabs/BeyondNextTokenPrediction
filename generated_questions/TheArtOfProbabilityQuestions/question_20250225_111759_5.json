    "question": "If \\(N\\) represents the total number of errors in a software, \\(M\\) represents the number of additional errors added, \\(n\\) is the number of original errors found, and \\(m\\) is the number of inserted errors found, derive the formula for estimating the number of errors left after finding \\(n\\) and \\(m\\).",
    "solution": "The formula for estimating the number of errors left is given by:\n\n\\[\nN - n = n \\left( \\frac{M}{m} - 1 \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis formula allows us to estimate the remaining errors after sampling. Thus, the number of errors left is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{N - n = n \\left( \\frac{M}{m} - 1 \\right)}\n\\]",
