    "question": "If a simulation produces results that are normally distributed with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2, what is the probability of obtaining a result greater than 12? (Use the Z-score formula and standard normal distribution tables for your calculations.)",
    "solution": "First, calculate the Z-score for a result of 12.\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = (12 - 10) / 2 = 1\n\nNext, consult the standard normal distribution table to find the probability corresponding to Z = 1, which is approximately 0.8413. This value represents the probability of obtaining a result less than 12.\n\nTo find the probability of obtaining a result greater than 12, subtract this value from 1.\n\nP(X > 12) = 1 - P(X < 12) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nThus, the probability of obtaining a result greater than 12 is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.1587}\n\\]",
