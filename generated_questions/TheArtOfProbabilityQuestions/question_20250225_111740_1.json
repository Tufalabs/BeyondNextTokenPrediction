    "solution": "From the table, the canonical partitions for \\( k = 10 \\) are:\n- (1, 3, 6)\n- (1, 4, 5)\n- (2, 2, 6)\n- (2, 3, 5)\n- (2, 4, 4)\n- (3, 3, 4)\n\nCounting these, we find there are 6 canonical partitions. \n\nThus, the total number of canonical partitions for \\( k = 10 \\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
