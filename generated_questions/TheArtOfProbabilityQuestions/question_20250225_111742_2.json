    "question": "If the wheel of the roulette is rotating at a speed of 3 revolutions per minute (RPM), how many degrees does the wheel rotate in 5 seconds?",
    "solution": "First, we convert the speed of the wheel from revolutions per minute to revolutions per second.\n\n3 RPM = 3 revolutions/minute \u00d7 (1 minute/60 seconds) = 0.05 revolutions/second.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of revolutions in 5 seconds.\n\nNumber of revolutions in 5 seconds = 0.05 revolutions/second \u00d7 5 seconds = 0.25 revolutions.\n\nSince one full revolution is 360 degrees, we can find the total degrees rotated in 5 seconds.\n\nTotal degrees = number of revolutions \u00d7 degrees per revolution = 0.25 revolutions \u00d7 360 degrees/revolution = 90 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]",
