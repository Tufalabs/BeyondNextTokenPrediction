    "question": "Suppose you have a collection of 10 distinct items. If you select 4 items at random without replacement, how many different permutations of these 4 items can be formed?",
    "solution": "To find the number of permutations of 4 items selected from 10 distinct items without replacement, we use the formula for permutations:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \\ldots (n - k + 1)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\). Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nP(10, 4) = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)\n2. \\( 90 \\times 8 = 720 \\)\n3. \\( 720 \\times 7 = 5040 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of different permutations is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5040}\n\\]",
