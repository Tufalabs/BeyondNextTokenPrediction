    "question": "If the time between calls follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 3 minutes, what is the probability that the time until the next call occurs is less than 2 minutes?",
    "solution": "The probability that a random variable \\(X\\) following an exponential distribution is less than a certain value \\(x\\) can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF):\n\n\\[\nP(X < x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\text{mean}}\\). Here, the mean is 3 minutes, so \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNow, substituting \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\nP(X < 2) = 1 - e^{-\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2} = 1 - e^{-\\frac{2}{3}} \\approx 1 - 0.5134 \\approx 0.4866\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the time until the next call occurs is less than 2 minutes is approximately \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.487}.\n\\]",
