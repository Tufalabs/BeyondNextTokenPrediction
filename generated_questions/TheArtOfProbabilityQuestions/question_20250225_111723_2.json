    "question": "In the same simulation, the results for 2000 trials showed that the number of tails (T) was 1011. Calculate the deviation from the expected number of tails, given that the expected probability of getting tails in a fair coin toss is also 1/2.",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of tails (E_T) in 2000 trials, we use the same method as for heads:\n\n\\[\nE_T = \\text{Total Trials} \\times \\text{Probability of Tails} = 2000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the deviation (D_T) from the expected number of tails:\n\n\\[\nD_T = \\text{Actual Tails} - \\text{Expected Tails} = 1011 - 1000 = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, the deviation from the expected number of tails is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
