    "question": "The variance of the original flat distribution from which random numbers are generated is 1/12. If you generate 12 independent numbers, what will be the variance of their sum?",
    "solution": "The variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. Since each of the 12 numbers has a variance of 1/12, the variance of their sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Variance of sum} = 12 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the variance of the sum of the 12 independent numbers is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
