    "question": "In a simulation, if the average call duration is 4 minutes and the simulation runs for 60 minutes, how many calls can be expected to occur during this time?",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of calls, we can divide the total simulation time by the average call duration:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Number of Calls} = \\frac{\\text{Total Time}}{\\text{Average Call Duration}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{4 \\text{ minutes}} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of calls that can occur during the 60 minutes is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}.\n\\]",
