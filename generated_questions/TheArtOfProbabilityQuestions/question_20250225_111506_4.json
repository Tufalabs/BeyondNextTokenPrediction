    "question": "If the host has a probability \\( p \\) of revealing a curtain that does not have the prize, what is the probability \\( P \\) of winning if you initially chose curtain A and the host reveals a curtain that does not have the prize?",
    "solution": "The probability of winning given that the host reveals a curtain that does not have the prize is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{p(AB) + p(AC)}{1 - p(BA) - p(CA)}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( p(AB) = p(AC) = \\frac{1}{6} \\) and \\( p(BA) = p(CA) = \\frac{(1-p)}{3} \\), we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{1 - 2\\frac{(1-p)}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2p}{3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2p}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 + 2p}}\n\\]",
