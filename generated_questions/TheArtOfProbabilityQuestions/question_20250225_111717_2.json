If you want to determine the absolute difference between the theoretical expected value and the median value from the simulation, what is that difference?",
    "solution": "To find the absolute difference, subtract the median value from the theoretical expected value.\n\nAbsolute difference = |Theoretical expected value - Median value| = |6.0 - 5.5| = 0.5\n\nThus, the absolute difference between the theoretical expected value and the median value is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5}\n\\]",
