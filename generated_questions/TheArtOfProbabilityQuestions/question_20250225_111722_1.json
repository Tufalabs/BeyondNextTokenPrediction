    "question": "In a game involving the roll of a die, if the payoff for \"hitting your point\" is 6 units, demonstrate that the game is fair. Assume that the probability of hitting your point is 1/6. What is the expected value of the game?",
    "solution": "To determine if the game is fair, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the game. The expected value is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nEV = (P(\\text{hitting point}) \\times \\text{payoff}) + (P(\\text{not hitting point}) \\times \\text{loss})\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Probability of hitting the point, \\( P(\\text{hitting point}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n- Payoff for hitting the point = 6 units\n- Probability of not hitting the point, \\( P(\\text{not hitting point}) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n- Loss for not hitting the point = 0 units (assuming no loss)\n\nThus, the expected value is:\n\n\\[\nEV = \\left(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 6\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5}{6} \\times 0\\right) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\\]\n\nSince the expected value is equal to the cost of playing (1 unit), the game is fair.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Value} = \\boxed{1}\n\\]",
