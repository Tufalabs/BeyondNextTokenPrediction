    "question": "A researcher is conducting an experiment where they roll a fair six-sided die 10 times. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 (i.e., either 5 or 6) at least once in those 10 rolls?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 at least once, we can first calculate the probability of not rolling a number greater than 4 in a single roll. The numbers greater than 4 are 5 and 6, which means there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number that is not greater than 4 (i.e., rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4) is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{not greater than 4}) = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability of not rolling a number greater than 4 in 10 rolls is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{not greater than 4 in 10 rolls}) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{10}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 at least once in 10 rolls is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one greater than 4}) = 1 - P(\\text{not greater than 4 in 10 rolls}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{10}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one greater than 4}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{10} \\approx 1 - 0.01734 \\approx 0.98266\n\\]\n\nThus, the final probability is approximately:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.9827}\n\\]",
