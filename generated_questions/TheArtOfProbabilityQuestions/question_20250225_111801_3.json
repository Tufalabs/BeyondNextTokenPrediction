    "question": "In a birthday problem scenario, if there are 23 people in a room, what is the probability that at least two people share the same birthday, assuming there are 365 days in a year?",
    "solution": "To find the probability that at least two people share the same birthday, we can first calculate the probability that no one shares a birthday and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that the first person has a unique birthday is \\( \\frac{365}{365} \\). The second person must have a different birthday, so the probability is \\( \\frac{364}{365} \\), and so on.\n\nFor 23 people, the probability \\( P \\) that all have different birthdays is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no shared birthdays}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\cdot \\frac{364}{365} \\cdot \\frac{363}{365} \\cdots \\frac{343}{365}\n\\]\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no shared birthdays}) = \\frac{365!}{(365 - 23)! \\cdot 365^{23}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no shared birthdays}) \\approx 0.4927\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\\text{no shared birthdays}) \\approx 1 - 0.4927 = 0.5073\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least two people share the same birthday is approximately \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5073}\n\\]",
