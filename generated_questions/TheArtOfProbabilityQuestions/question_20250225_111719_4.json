    "question": "If the sensitivity of a probability result is defined as the change in the result when the initial probability is increased by 0.05, and the original probability was 0.25, what is the new probability after the increase? Provide your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "To find the new probability after the increase, we simply add the increase to the original probability:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Probability} = \\text{Original Probability} + \\text{Increase}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the original probability is 0.25 and the increase is 0.05, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Probability} = 0.25 + 0.05 = 0.30\n\\]\n\nThus, the new probability after the increase is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.30}\n\\]",
