    "question": "What is the expected value of the sum of four dice? Each die has values from 1 to 6. Calculate the expected value.",
    "solution": "The expected value \\( E \\) of a single die is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\n\\]\n\nSince we are rolling four dice, the expected value of the sum of four dice is:\n\n\\[\nE(\\text{sum of four dice}) = 4 \\cdot E(\\text{single die}) = 4 \\cdot 3.5 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected value of the sum of four dice is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",
