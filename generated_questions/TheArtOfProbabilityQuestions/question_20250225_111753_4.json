    "question": "If a ball is rolling down a ramp that is inclined at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal, and the length of the ramp is 5 meters, calculate the vertical height from which the ball is rolling down. Use the sine function, where \\(\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\).",
    "solution": "To find the vertical height \\(h\\) from which the ball is rolling down, we can use the sine function:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{h}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) and the hypotenuse (length of the ramp) is 5 meters. Rearranging the formula gives:\n\n\\[\nh = \\text{hypotenuse} \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) = 5 \\cdot \\sin(30^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\nh = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the vertical height from which the ball is rolling down is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2.5} \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]",
