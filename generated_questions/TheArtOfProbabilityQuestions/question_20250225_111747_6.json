    "question": "If a rod is shortened to a thin, flat disc (like a coin), and you toss it, what is the probability of it landing on one of its two faces, assuming it cannot land on the edge?",
    "solution": "When the rod is shortened to a thin, flat disc, it has 2 faces (heads and tails). Assuming equal probability for each face, the probability \\( P \\) of landing on one specific face is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of faces}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of landing on one of its two faces is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]",
