    "question": "If you have a game show scenario where the host reveals a non-winning curtain after you make your initial choice, and you have three curtains to choose from, what is the probability of winning if you switch your choice after the host reveals a non-winning curtain?",
    "solution": "In the game show scenario, you initially choose one of three curtains, behind one of which is a prize. The probability of winning if you stick with your initial choice is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). \n\nIf you switch after the host reveals a non-winning curtain, the probability of winning becomes:\n\n1. If your initial choice was the winning curtain (probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)), switching will result in a loss.\n2. If your initial choice was a non-winning curtain (probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)), switching will result in a win.\n\nThus, the probability of winning if you switch is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{win by switching}) = P(\\text{initially chose non-winning}) = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning if you switch your choice is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]",
