    "solution": "The expected value \\( E \\) of the random variable is 20. Therefore, the total expected sum of the observations over 200 trials is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Expected Sum} = n \\cdot E = 200 \\cdot 20 = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total expected sum of the observations is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4000}\n\\]",
