    "question": "If there are 6 discs numbered from 1 to 6, what is the probability of drawing them in a preassigned order?",
    "solution": "To find the probability of drawing 6 discs in a preassigned order, we first note that there are a total of 6 discs. The total number of ways to arrange these 6 discs is given by \\(6!\\).\n\nSince we want them in a specific preassigned order, there is only 1 favorable outcome.\n\nThus, the probability \\(P\\) is given by:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{6!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(6!\\):\n\\[\n6! = 720\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{720}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{720}}\n\\]",
