    "question": "Given the function \\( y = \\ln z \\), find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point where \\( z = 1 \\). Use the derivative \\( \\frac{dy}{dz} = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to determine the slope at this point.",
    "solution": "To find the equation of the tangent line at \\( z = 1 \\), we first calculate the slope using the derivative:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dz} = \\frac{1}{z}\n\\]\n\nAt \\( z = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dz} \\bigg|_{z=1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThe point on the curve at \\( z = 1 \\) is \\( (1, 0) \\) since \\( y = \\ln(1) = 0 \\). Using the point-slope form of the line:\n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(z - z_1)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (z_1, y_1) \\) is the point on the curve, we have:\n\n\\[\ny - 0 = 1(z - 1)\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent line is:\n\n\\[\ny = z - 1\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y = z - 1}\n\\]",
