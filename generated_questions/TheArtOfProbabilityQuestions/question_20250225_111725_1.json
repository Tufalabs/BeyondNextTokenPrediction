    "question": "In a family with two children, what is the probability that both children are boys, given that at least one of them is a boy? Assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2).",
    "solution": "To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability. Let:\n- A = event that both children are boys.\n- B = event that at least one child is a boy.\n\nWe need to find P(A | B). \n\nThe possible combinations of children are:\n1. Boy-Boy (BB)\n2. Boy-Girl (BG)\n3. Girl-Boy (GB)\n4. Girl-Girl (GG)\n\nSince we know at least one child is a boy, we can eliminate the Girl-Girl (GG) combination. This leaves us with:\n1. Boy-Boy (BB)\n2. Boy-Girl (BG)\n3. Girl-Boy (GB)\n\nThus, the favorable outcomes for event A (both are boys) is 1 (BB), and the total outcomes for event B (at least one is a boy) is 3 (BB, BG, GB).\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability:\n\\[ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThus, the probability that both children are boys given that at least one is a boy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
