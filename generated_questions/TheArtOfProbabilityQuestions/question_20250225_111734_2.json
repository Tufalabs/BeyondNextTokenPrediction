    "question": "Using the data from the table for 9 intervals, what is the percentage of cases for the digit '5'?",
    "solution": "From the table for 9 intervals, the number of cases for the digit '5' is given as 7. The total number of cases is 81. To find the percentage of cases for the digit '5', we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of cases for digit '5'}}{\\text{Total number of cases}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{7}{81} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 8.641975\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of cases for the digit '5' is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8.64}\n\\]",
