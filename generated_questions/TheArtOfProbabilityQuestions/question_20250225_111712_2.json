    "question": "Using the second method from Bertrand's Paradox, if you randomly select one point on the circumference of a circle and assume that the other endpoint of the chord is uniformly spread around the circumference, what is the probability that the chord is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle?",
    "solution": "According to the second method described in Bertrand's Paradox, the probability that the chord is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle is given as:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
