    "question": "If a person is asked to continually refine their betting odds for an event and they start with odds of 5 to 1, but after several revisions, they settle on odds of 1 to 1, what is the change in the implied probability of the event occurring from the start to the end?",
    "solution": "Initially, with odds of 5 to 1, the implied probability is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Probability} = \\frac{1}{5 + 1} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nAfter revisions, with odds of 1 to 1, the implied probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Probability} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo find the change in probability, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Change in Probability} = \\text{Final Probability} - \\text{Initial Probability} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the change in the implied probability of the event occurring is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
