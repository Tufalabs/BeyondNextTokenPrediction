    "question": "In the scenario where the host randomly reveals a curtain that does not have the prize, what is the probability that the prize is behind curtain A if the host reveals curtain B?",
    "solution": "If the host reveals curtain B, it means that the prize is either behind curtain A or curtain C. The probability of the prize being behind A remains 1/3, while the probability of it being behind C is 2/3. Therefore, the probability that the prize is behind curtain A given that curtain B was revealed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{1/3}{1/3 + 2/3} = \\frac{1/3}{1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
