    "question": "If you roll a biased die that has outcomes 1, 2, and 3 with probabilities \\(p_1 = 0.5\\), \\(p_2 = 0.3\\), and \\(p_3 = 0.2\\), what is the expected value of the outcome when rolling this die twice?",
    "solution": "The expected value \\(E\\) of a single roll of the biased die is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = 1 \\cdot p_1 + 2 \\cdot p_2 + 3 \\cdot p_3 = 1 \\cdot 0.5 + 2 \\cdot 0.3 + 3 \\cdot 0.2\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.6 = 1.7\n\\]\n\nWhen rolling the die twice, the expected value of the sum of the outcomes is:\n\n\\[\nE(X_1 + X_2) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) = 1.7 + 1.7 = 3.4\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected value of the outcome when rolling the biased die twice is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.4}.\n\\]",
