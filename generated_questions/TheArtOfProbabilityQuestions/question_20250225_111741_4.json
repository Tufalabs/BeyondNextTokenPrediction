    "question": "If the probability of being outside the range of \u00b16u in a normal distribution is approximately 2 x 10^-9, what is the probability of being within the range of \u00b16u?",
    "solution": "The probability of being within the range of \u00b16u can be calculated by subtracting the probability of being outside this range from 1. Given that the probability of being outside the range is approximately 2 x 10^-9, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability within } \\pm 6u = 1 - 2 \\times 10^{-9} \\approx 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of being within the range of \u00b16u is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
