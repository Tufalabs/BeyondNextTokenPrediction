    "question": "A board is ruled into unit squares, and a disc of radius \\( a \\) (where \\( a < 1 \\)) is tossed at random. What is the probability that the disc does not cross any line? Additionally, determine the value of \\( a \\) when the chance of not crossing a line is 50%.",
    "solution": "The probability \\( p \\) that the disc does not cross any line is given by the formula:\n\\[\np = (1 - a)^2\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( a \\) when the chance is 50%, we set:\n\\[\n(1 - a)^2 = 0.5\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[\n1 - a = \\sqrt{0.5}\n\\]\n\\[\na = 1 - \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 1 - 0.7071 \\approx 0.2929\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of the disc not crossing any line is given by:\n\\[\np = (1 - a)^2 = 0.5\n\\]\n\nFinal answer for \\( a \\):\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.2929}\n\\]",
