    "question": "In a uniform probability model, if you randomly select a day from a year that has 365 days, what is the probability of selecting any specific day, such as January 1st?",
    "solution": "In a uniform probability model, the probability of selecting any specific day is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (which is 1 for a specific day) by the total number of possible outcomes (which is 365 days in a year). \n\nThus, the probability \\( P \\) of selecting January 1st is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{365}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a specific day is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{365}}\n\\]",
