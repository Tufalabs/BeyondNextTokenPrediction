    "question": "If a radioactive material emits events at a rate of 50 counts per minute, how many counts would be expected in a 10-minute observation period?",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of counts in a 10-minute observation period, we multiply the rate of counts per minute by the number of minutes.\n\nExpected counts = Rate of counts per minute \u00d7 Number of minutes  \nExpected counts = 50 counts/minute \u00d7 10 minutes = 500 counts  \n\nThus, the expected number of counts in a 10-minute observation period is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{500}\n\\]",
