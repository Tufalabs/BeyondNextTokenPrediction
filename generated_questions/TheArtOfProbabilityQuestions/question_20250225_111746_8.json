    "question": "In the table, the leading digit '50' has both an observed and theoretical frequency of 50. What is the difference between these frequencies?",
    "solution": "To find the difference between the observed and theoretical frequencies for the leading digit '50', we calculate as follows:\n\nObserved frequency for leading digit '50' = 50  \nTheoretical frequency for leading digit '50' = 50  \n\nDifference = Observed - Theoretical = 50 - 50 = 0\n\nTherefore, the difference is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
