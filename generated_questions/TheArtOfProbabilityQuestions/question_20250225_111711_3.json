    "question": "If we consider the sum of three independent random numbers drawn from a bounded flat distribution with a variance of 1/12, what is the variance of the sum of these three random numbers?",
    "solution": "The variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. Therefore, if each random number has a variance of \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\), the variance of the sum of three such random numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Variance of sum} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the variance of the sum of the three random numbers is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]",
