    "question": "If the distance from a river is measured to be 192 meters, what is the distance in kilometers?",
    "solution": "To convert meters to kilometers, we use the conversion factor \\(1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ m}\\). Therefore, the distance in kilometers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance in km} = \\frac{192 \\text{ m}}{1000} = 0.192 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance from the river in kilometers is \\(\\boxed{0.192}\\).",
