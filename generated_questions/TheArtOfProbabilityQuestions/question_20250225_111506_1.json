    "question": "In a game where you choose one of three curtains (A, B, or C) and a host reveals a curtain that does not have a prize behind it, what is the probability that the prize is behind your chosen curtain if you initially chose curtain A? Assume the host knows where the prize is and will never reveal it.",
    "solution": "When you initially choose curtain A, the probability of the prize being behind A is 1/3. The host will then reveal either curtain B or C, depending on where the prize is. If the prize is behind A, the host can choose either B or C to reveal. If the prize is behind B or C, the host will reveal the other curtain that does not have the prize. \n\nThus, the probability that the prize is behind A remains 1/3, while the probability that it is behind either B or C combined is 2/3. Therefore, the probability that the prize is behind your chosen curtain A is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]",
