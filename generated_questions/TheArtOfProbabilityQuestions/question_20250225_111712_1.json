    "question": "In the context of Bertrand's Paradox, if you randomly draw a chord in a circle and you want to find the probability that this chord is longer than the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the same circle, what is the probability using the first method described, where the position where the chord cuts the radius that is perpendicular to the chord is selected?",
    "solution": "Using the first method described in Bertrand's Paradox, the probability that a randomly drawn chord is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle is given as:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]",
