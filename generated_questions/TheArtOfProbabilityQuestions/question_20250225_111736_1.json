    "question": "Consider the scenario where you are tossing three coins. Each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). How many total outcomes are there when tossing three coins?",
    "solution": "To find the total number of outcomes when tossing three coins, we can use the formula for the product space. Since each coin has 2 outcomes and there are 3 coins, we calculate the total outcomes as follows:\n\nTotal outcomes = \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8\\).\n\nThus, the total number of outcomes when tossing three coins is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
