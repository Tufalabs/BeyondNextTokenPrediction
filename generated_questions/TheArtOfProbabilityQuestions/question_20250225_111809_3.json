    "question": "In a situation where \\( n = 4 \\) letters are randomly placed in envelopes, calculate the expected number of letters that will not be in their correct envelopes.",
    "solution": "To find the expected number of letters that will not be in their correct envelopes, we first calculate the expected number of letters that are in their correct envelopes using the formula:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{4!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( 1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2!} = 0.5 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{3!} \\approx 0.1667 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{4!} \\approx 0.0417 \\)\n\nNow substituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = 1 - 1 + 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = 0 + 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417\n\\]\n\\[\nE(X) = 0.5 - 0.1667 = 0.3333\n\\]\n\\[\nE(X) = 0.3333 + 0.0417 = 0.3750\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of letters that are in their correct envelopes is approximately \\( 0.3750 \\). Since there are \\( n = 4 \\) letters, the expected number of letters that will not be in their correct envelopes is:\n\n\\[\nn - E(X) = 4 - 0.3750 = 3.6250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters that will not be in their correct envelopes is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.6250}\n\\]",
