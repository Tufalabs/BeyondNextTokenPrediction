    "question": "What is the significance of the mass of the electron in relation to hydrogen, and how does it compare?",
    "solution": "The mass of the electron, calculated to be approximately 9.10 x 10^-28 g, is significant because it is about 2000 times less than the mass of hydrogen, which is the lightest atom. This comparison highlights the relative lightness of the electron as a fundamental particle in the structure of matter, emphasizing its role in atomic interactions and the overall mass of atoms.",
