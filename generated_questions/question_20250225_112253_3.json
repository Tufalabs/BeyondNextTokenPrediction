    "question": "If the host has a probability \\( p \\) of revealing a curtain that does not have the prize, and a probability \\( q = 1 - p \\) of revealing the curtain with the prize, what is the expression for the probability \\( P \\) that the prize is behind your initial choice after the host reveals a non-prize curtain?",
    "solution": "The probability \\( P \\) that the prize is behind your initial choice after the host reveals a non-prize curtain can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1/3}{1/3 + 2p/3} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2p}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression for the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 + 2p}}\n\\]",
