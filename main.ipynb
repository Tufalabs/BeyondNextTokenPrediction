      "A transmitter satellite (Tx) and a receiver satellite (Rx) are on opposite ends of a large volume of cold plasma of unknown dimension and density. A static uniform magnetic field is present, and the electron-cyclotron frequency is observed to be 6 kHz. The transmitter sends two linearly polarized EM signals at two frequencies, 68 kHz and 58 kHz. The 68 kHz signal arrives at the receiver linearly polarized but with a Faraday rotation of 5°. The 58 kHz signal arrives LH circularly polarized. Assuming that the plasma density is uniform across the volume, determine the upper and lower bounds of the plasma’s lateral dimension \\( d \\) and density \\( N \\).

To do so, we will need to recall (1) the shapes of bonding and antibonding s and p molecular orbitals, (2) that each orbital can contain a maximum of two electrons, (3) that molecular oxygen has 16 electrons in total, and (4) that the two unpaired electrons in oxygen occupy separate degenerate (equal-energy) orbitals.
